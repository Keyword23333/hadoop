7950000 my campaign is working hard to inform the citizenry of the 13th district to win their vote and therefore the election i understand that i have to work hard to win and do that without the party doing much for us i dont have any problem with that at all
7950001 what the republican party doesnt like is independence its not how long youve been in the party or in the political trenches its will you be a yes man will you say exactly what we want you to say
7950002 i think what the partys concern is she could be an embarrassment if she wins because if she wins without their support its going to look real bad
7950003 its very rare that somebody pops out of nowhere and wins
7950004 there are no overnight sensations when you lose you dont pack up your toys and go home you keep your head in the game
7950005 it is a sad commentary not to make a commitment to support honeycutts candidacy
7950006 they talk about the big tent they talk about being inclusive i guess i should say its simply the illusion of inclusion
7950007 if the republican party doesnt support a black candidate that makes it difficult to justify being a republican
7950008 personally i think hes become the jesse jackson of the georgia republican party hes learned how to pimp the system he is their spokesperson who knows how to get paid its not about issues with him its about a pay day
7950009 i dont think rufus has anything personal against deborah i think rufus will do anything he can to maintain rufus power when deborah gets elected rufus power goes away rufus is a smart man he knows if deborah wins without his help his power and influence is history if david scott wins he still has power with the republican party
7950010 there are many who would take my honeycutt comments as an attack when it comes to what is required to gain support from the republican party as an african american republican if a major tenet of your campaign strategy is relying on party support against an incumbent then you are not going to make it
7950011 i think it is a national disgrace that in the year 2008 that the republican party does not have one black elected official in congress thats a travesty
7950012 i think as lincoln looks down at this party he must have tears in his eyes because this is nothing like what he thought to be the civil rights party these guys have now taken it the other way
7950013 that raises a question that folks dont want to talk about the question becomes whether or not republicans are ready to work for and vote for black republicans thats the issue that must be addressed
7950014 ni deseos ni intenciones de que se reanude una confrontaci n con mosc como la guerra fr a tal y como parece buscar rusia
7950015 this is a way to help georgia make their web pages visible to the world
7950016 i havent seen anything from apple that seems to show that its attack ing the enterprise market
7950017 client virtualization will be very big but tech populism will be even bigger
7950018 theres a mind shift happening in it and were starting to see that change theyre loosening up their policies on whats acceptable
7950019 in the end they want their employees to be as productive as humanly possible so theyll approve tools that people are more comfortable with the tools they may be running at home
7950020 theyre saying if we can find some way to manage and support these we will
7950021 its all just less about what end users clients are running
7950022 certainly some businesses and also some u s government agencies will explore diversifying their portfolios
7950023 weve talked to some who have explicit goals to have macs account for 10 of their client base for example but i think apple will continue a slow but steady increase not accelerate
7950024 at amp t has worked diligently to provide affordable options for international roaming because the feature rich mobile experience of iphone is indispensable to users

7950050 the last time i did an interview with you guys they were talking like they had babalu and vitor belfort i feel like i match up well with those guys babalu isnt as mentally tough as i am like i said my cardio and conditioning are always a step up so thats what i rely on to win some of these other guys like babalu are good on the ground vitor belfort are good standing up so they rely on those things to win i rely on conditioning so now i can take a punch and eventually wear my opponent out they get mentally drained and physically drained because they keep hitting me but nothing is happening so i think i have an advantage there both of those fights are ones i would love to take

7950057 how are local police agencies making money from dwi arrests
7950058 are these tests designed to make a person look bad or look good
7950059 keep breathing breathe harder harder keep going thats good you doing great
7950060 how breathing techniques can influence the results of breath alcohol analyses
7950061 by far the most overlooked error in breath testing for alcohol is the pattern of breathing the concentration of alcohol changes considerably during the breath the first part of the breath after discarding the dead space has an alcohol concentration much lower than the equivalent bac whereas the last part of the breath has an alcohol concentration that is much higher than the equivalent bac the last part of the breath can be over 50 above the alcohol level thus a breath tester reading of 0 14 taken from the last part of the breath may indicate that the blood level is only 0 09
7950062 are these tests designed to make a person look bad or look good
7950063 are the manufacturers of the machine sure of its accuracy
7950064 intoxilyzer 5000 manufactured by cmi inc how reliable is this machine at measuring alcohol in a persons blood by measuring his breath how accurate well what do the manufacturers think how confidant are they that these devices are reliable enough to send a man to jail
7950065 cmi inc a subsidiary of mpd inc warrants that each new product will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one year from the date of delivery to the first user purchaser
7950066 repaired components are warranted for a period of 90 days from the date of repair
7950067 there are no other warranties expressed or implied including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose
7950068 if you end up going to jail because of defects in our machines you cant sue us
7950069 bloomberg has touched a nerve what is crazy is pretending this 350 year old city can keep running on splintering electric lines from as far away as ohio or from antiquated power plants in queens when we make jokes about how outlandish it is are we mocking the mayor for hubris are we laughing because the mayor has dared us to admit how scared we are to keep driving blind into the future
7950070 esse grupo j passou muito para mim j amadureci demais n o f cil entrar como entramos durante os jogos a press o e a responsabilidade s o muito grandes aos poucos vou me acostumando

7950081 o dod tem uma personalidade muito forte e n o aceita ficar no banco de reservas mas n o o jogador que se escala pois quem est bem joga e quem n o vem bem fica como op o no banco de reservas quando isso come a a gerar um problema e atrapalhar o andamento das coisas a diretoria tem mesmo que tomar uma atitude
7950082 ele um jogador diferenciado sabe fazer gols como poucos e sabe os atalhos para chegar na cara do goleiro n o podemos bobear com ele dentro da rea n o j avisei aos meus jogadores de que quando a bola vier da linha de fundo tem de marcar o t lio ombro a ombro sem dar espa o porque ele n o vacila
7950083 as olimp adas permitiram uma experi ncia in dita para o internauta e para o terra pela primeira vez na hist ria se pode acompanhar gratuitamente toda a transmiss o do principal evento desportivo mundial em 13 canais simult neos ao vivo ou on demand e near live pelo celular foi uma oportunidade nica de conhecer o comportamento do internauta diante de uma transmiss o deste porte

7950086 esperava poder dar uma seq ncia no time mas infelizmente n o pude pela dor que estou sentindo eu acho muito dif cil jogar no s bado
7950087 n o acho que s o superiores foram naquele momento tiveram um saque muito bom n s tivemos a chance de empatar a partida tivemos chance de fechar mas naquele momento eles estavam melhores quase perderam para a s rvia e quase perderam para a r ssia n o estou tirando o m rito deles muito pelo contr rio
7950088 o que mais me motiva estar com esse grupo e o segundo o desafio espero que consiga continuar com essa vontade e quero encontrar esses rapazes com a mesma vontade que estavam
7950089 pensei em me aposentar depois de ganhar a medalha mas agora quero treinar curtir porque ainda tenho ch o por eu ter voltado a saltar os 7 m com 32 anos n o d pra parar agora

7950094 espero que eles os refor os cheguem com o mesmo pensamento do nosso grupo que o de conquistar o brasileiro
7950095 teremos jogos muito complicados pois todas as equipes est o buscando seus objetivos na competi o temos que fazer a coisa certa para que os resultados possam aparecer
7950096 eu prefiro come ar jogando foi assim que fiz o meu melhor jogo no campeonato contra o sport quando marquei dois gols

7950100 it would be a shame to see a good property like toorale taken out of production and turned into a national park but if thats what the taxpayers want then so be it
7950101 the government is carefully considering the likely future benefits for the environment and the communities of western nsw
7950102 the cotton growers are offering an opportunity to return large volumes of water to the system
7950103 we have whole towns which rely on these farms for their livelihood
7950104 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7950105 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7950106 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7950107 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7950108 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7950109 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7950110 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7950111 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7950112 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7950113 in order to have affordable housing you shouldnt have to live in tracy if you work in san jose
7950114 you should have a range of housing and transportation options
7950115 we used to cut down a lot of trees to plant cocoa cutting down trees used to be normal
7950116 elephants come to raid our crops then we have to buy food elsewhere
7950117 there seemed to be a lot of will and support for the idea that the communities should be receiving benefits
7950118 there is an overall understanding that aiding local people is an important part of what we should do
7950119 we learnt from experts in zambia that elephants dont like pepper
7950120 when the air temperature rises two to three degrees the arctic tundra would switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source
7950121 the greater the carbon stores the greater the impact it causes
7950122 warming will increase the decomposition rate of the soil organic matter and more carbon dioxide will be generated
7950123 warming will thaw the permafrost and release the sequestered carbon
7950124 its going to be a heavy lift it takes time in our system
7950125 anything that raises the price of electricity is going to be a political problem
7950126 as far as i am aware all the bills at least the analysis i have seen would not get the united states back to 1990
7950127 it was something that climate change adviser ross garnaut had in his paper proposing that there be matching tax treatment but is absent in the governments green paper
7950128 there is going to be a tax advantage to buying permits rather than spending money on capital expenditure which may be lucrative enough to discourage companies investing in carbon abatement activities
7950129 preferably the tax deductions for buying equipment should match up to what you would have had on expenditure for permits
7950130 if that were to be deductible in one year for permits then maybe that is what expenditure on equipment should also be
7950131 the world knows that the eastern amazon continues to experience problems with deforestation and fragmentation but the western amazon still has large tracts of intact rainforest
7950132 we are worried that these projects could disturb and open up some of the most remote and intact places
7950133 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7950134 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7950135 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
7950136 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
7950137 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done
7950138 journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source different journals have different ethical standards
7950139 im sure there will be a change of policy this autumn
7950140 what the detail is of that change will determine the level of my enthusiasm for remaining
7950141 they are simply going to make much more money for doing absolutely nothing
7950142 it is difficult we dont have a health centre no school even though we are near the capital
7950143 over there not far from our village the people are getting free treated mosquito nets and other goods while we are not informed about it i am sure they forgot about us
7950144 when we are sick we use herbs in complicated cases we go to the town sometimes its too late and some die
7950145 many diseases especially hiv cases are common among these people as they have little access to medical care because of extreme poverty
7950146 we cannot live with people who do not like us and who make fun of us
7950147 in my class no one wanted to sit with me
7950148 to them i didnt have the right i wasnt like them
7950149 chinas stellar growth in renewable can also be attributed to the speed at which it has built up its supply chain capability to the point where it is likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
7950150 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry
7950151 the wild gene of yak is thus very important for future genetic studies for diseases resistance etc the study aims to evolve a long term population and habitat monitoring protocol for yak as other fauna in the region
7950152 found at an altitude of 6 000 meters the blue sheep differs from the goat as it doesnt have a beard likewise it differs from the sheep in the complete absence of glands on the face its existence is a key indicator of health status of snow leopards which is unfortunately not encouraging
7950153 the colouring of the upper portion of the body is chestnut or red and the under parts are white there is a dark brown dorsal stripe extended from the stiff black mane to the tuft of the tail
7950154 we will go the extra mile to be on time
7950155 this is a classic boom bust cycle and its not at all good for the industry
7950156 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite sea side destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7950157 to try and predict what these places will look like in the future we have examined how sea level rise and increased storms will affect all our coastal sites we know where change is most likely to happen and what this change might be
7950158 we need to realise that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable society needs to learn to adapt
7950159 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7950160 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7950161 something were trying to do in our little way is fill that funding gap thats still out there between the very early stage family and friends round and venture capital
7950162 we do think calcef clean energy angel fund has an important position both as a way to bridge this funding gap but also as credibility in the energy space that allows other less familiar investors to get more comfortable
7950163 if you look at who backs internet and telecom and semiconductor and life science companies its entrepreneurs who made a lot of money in that space in the past
7950164 right now there are lots of vcs that are followers
7950165 they want others to prove theres a technology there and put the first money there and prove that it works then youll have 50 people who want to put money in
7950166 were not going to do a thin film solar company that requires 200 million in venture investment
7950167 warming in the himalayan region has been much greater than global average both increasing and decreasing rainfall patters have been detected in the area weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable and extreme dry seasons become dryer and wet seasons wetter this phenomenon is causing concern over the long term reduction in total water supply affecting lives and livelihoods of the himalayan people especially in agriculture practices and long term food security
7950168 there is an urgent need to increase scientific co operation and regional collaboration to reduce this information gap
7950169 the hindu kush himalayan region is the highest most complex mountain region in the world it extends more than 3500km over eight countries from afghanistan in the north west to myanmar in the south east the region ranges from the plateau regions of tibet and other mountain areas of china to the ganges basin in india and has the upland watersheds of the ten major asian river systems
7950170 we started the patrol monday the team has around 15 members we arranged this patrol following information from tamil nadu authorities that poachers could become active along kerala tamil nadu border this season
7950171 with the help of elephants we can enter even thick forests and marshy areas elephants clear the way for those on foot while riding on elephant better surveillance is also possible
7950172 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7950173 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7950174 ser goleiro e espanhol s o obst culos para receb lo
7950175 this is an organization with no known other activities no known financial support of any significance
7950176 the majority of aips annual expenditures are not political expenditures but are devoted to grassroots lobbying and education on issues public policies and other communications activities and programs appropriate to a 501 c 4 social welfare organization in accordance with all applicable provisions of the internal revenue code
7950177 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimidation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7950178 violate the law in both directions both in the raising and the expenditure of the funds
7950179 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
7950180 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
7950181 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
7950182 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7950183 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7950184 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7950185 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse
7950186 i have performed several reductions and have never had a case where i lost all the fetuses she needed to know that
7950187 there are just no rules or protocols for doctors to follow in this country
7950188 laws will be passed and they are not followed or implemented no one had any idea what to do when it came to ghazalas births it sort of all just happened
7950189 women can actually get pregnant with seven eight or nine babies
7950190 we need to tell people that it is safe and that it is ok religiously
7950191 the koshi river has changed its course and nearly 20 25 lakh 2 2 5 million people of the areas have been affected
7950192 their anger is natural since they never thought that floods would leave them stranded in this way and they were not prepared to face the floods which happened suddenly
7950193 the plan aims to eliminate imports of illegally harvested timber and timber products into the eu and support progress towards sustainable forest management
7950194 thanks to the high level of commitment from the malaysian side we have made good progress if we can resolve the few remaining issues then an agreement should be ready by the end of this year
7950195 that is also the goal and wish of the lead negotiator on the malaysian side datuk peter chin fah kui who is also the minister of plantation industries and commodities
7950196 right now we have a number of independent experts doing an analysis of how the malaysian authorities and private sector assess the legality of malaysian wood
7950197 the project aims to harvest 14 million cubic metres 494 4 million cu ft of timber worth about us 4 billion
7950198 there are very similar circumstances in numerous countries around the world including ivory coast cameroon brazil surinam malaysia and others
7950199 the potential is there they are awaiting to see the outcome of the ghana project
7950200 5 million hectares 12 36 million acres of salvageable submerged timber in the hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics with the potential to supplement global demand for timber
7950201 boat collisions with submerged tree stumps cause many fatalities every year
7950202 maybe at the time we thought we had enough timber in our forest estates to sustain us now because of the decline we need to diversify
7950203 the epas refusal to control pollution from oil refineries is the latest example of the bush administrations do nothing policy on global warming
7950204 what we need is a deliberative concerted effort that takes into account greenhouse gases but also economic concerns
7950205 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15 billion us dollars this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7950206 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7950207 to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
7950208 in the uk alone biofuel subsidies cost 550m annually in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 of all uk co2 emissions
7950209 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
7950210 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies
7950211 while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
7950212 time and again the government has been warned that their policy of targets without safeguards is madness
7950213 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7950214 when i was young you had to climb a coconut tree to see the sea
7950215 every year the sea comes closer we keep moving the village and we are being pushed down to the lagoon
7950216 i dont want to say there is some magical solution here
7950217 youre pro environment when talking about the environment but not with energy extraction
7950218 sen obama embraces drilling for natural gas but respecting wildlife habitat and the needs of sportsmen

7950223 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square kilometers
7950224 simply put sustainable development is that development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs
7950225 the big picture is that global warming is putting hurricanes on steroids
7950226 as so many grapple with tropical storm fays landfall in the united states our thoughts and prayers are with those in harms way
7950227 although no single weather event can be attributed to global warming its critical to understand that a warming climate is supplying the very conditions that fuel the strongest storms
7950228 increasing vulnerability to hurricanes global warmings wake up call for the u s gulf and atlantic coasts
7950229 we must account for increasing storm activity and rising sea level when managing our coasts especially by restoring and protecting coastal wetlands lowlands and barrier islands that provide crucial natural levees
7950230 agriculture outputs in some countries could suffer a 50 decrease due to the effects of climate change
7950231 the average world rate of the rise in sea level is between 1 8cm and 3 1cm per annum from 1961 to 1993
7950232 forecasts indicate that the rise in the sea level will be between 18cm and 59cm in the end of the 21st century

7950242 i was a little surprised but ive had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go
7950243 i will be ready at a moments notice you never know whats going to happen my plan is to stay ready my role from everyone elses standpoint has changed and thats taken a little bit of time to get over ill never fully get over it and i dont think anyone would expect me to
7950244 but theres a role for everyone on the football team sometimes you dont like it but as a team player you have to go with it and thats what rex is doing

7950251 we dont necessary worry about the pricing plan or the carrier as users just want a good experience on their iphone we seem to be attracting the people that want to go and play with itunes on wi fi
7950252 our big numbers were blown out completely thats a good thing because the wi fi system hasnt shown any problems with the increase in numbers
7950253 if someone is using their iphone at a tomizone hotspot the owner gets paid for that usage so that also helps drive the appeal of setting up the hotspot we had a hotspot owner last week in new zealand who got a payout from us of 2200 it cost him nothing but the wi fi router and internet connection
7950254 alternative arrangements have been made and tours continue as normal weather permitting
7950255 at issue is the demand from farocean for outstanding payment rim the museum is dissatisfied with the number of significant defects on the vessel
7950256 despite numerous attempts to meet with them to settle the dispute farocean did not come to the party
7950257 as far as rim is concerned it is state property and should not have been attached
7950258 there have been indications that farocean is now prepared to meet with us and we await a response from them so that we can settle this matter speedily
7950259 the rim keeps on saying that it doesnt have the money to pay me i believe it will though

7950261 when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one
7950262 after any show we can always be found chatting to our audience signing stuff and generally hanging out by the cd table i always make a point of asking people how they first heard about us
7950263 the three most common answers are theyve been dragged along by friends they heard us on the radio or someone gave them a copy of one of our cds this last one is usually accompanied by a look of collective guilt and embarrassment
7950264 lets consider this more closely a person who values our music has kindly made a copy of a cd and gone out of their way to spread the word about us that recipient has then bought both a ticket to see us and a cd on the night
7950265 you may call this process piracy if you wish for me it is an act of generosity and it both increases our audience size and record sales and as i always say on the night if youre going to do it anyway you may as well feel good about it

7950276 i think most of them were bored the deal flow is not there and a lot of the tiny details you have to deal with day to day in a corporate environment are not there in investment banking

7950380 we know from over a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the ice sea and tundra
7950381 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
7950382 yesterday i had a tip off as to where they were being kept whether it was true or not im not sure i received another tip off today from a journalist who claims he actually had been talking with the kidnappers
7950383 they went to a particular refugee camp out there and thats been confirmed by some journalists who we know in the area it was on the way back they were abducted
7950384 our experiences in the past have been that people who are kidnapped are treated generally fairly well and its really done for the money not for political reasons but again this is all speculation
7950385 the rumour is that its the al shabab which is the militant wing of the islamic courts union but the government and the islamic courts union who are the insurgents at the moment in somalia have both condemned the abduction and not taken any responsibility for it this is all speculation but the impression that im getting from our sources is that this was done by a group of bandits and theres not real political motivation behind the abduction other than for money

7950408 biologists of all stripes acknowledge an amazing ability of various plants and animals to adapt to specialized niches for example scientists have recently discovered a new species wholly unrelated to any previously known species which survives on the lips of one particular type of lobster morris 1995 although this form of evolution is remarkable it also leaves the creatures vulnerable to even a slight change in the environment the same specialization that made these creatures so dependent on the success of a relatively small group of lobsters makes them less adaptable to relatively small changes in the global environment for example this particular group of lobsters may decline or migrate to a less desirable location threatening the existence of their tiny lip dwellers
7950409 the price of sawdust has soared since 2006 up from about 25 a ton to more than 100 in some markets blame the housing slump fewer new homes mean fewer trees cut for use in construction which leads to less sawdust and other wood waste driving up the price
7950410 farms use sawdust and wood shavings as cozy and clean bedding for horses and chickens
7950411 wineries use oak sawdust as a flavoring agent for some wines perdue farms which raises broiler chickens goes through seven million cubic feet of wood shavings a year oil rig operators in wyoming and colorado pour sawdust into the caverns they find deep inside rock formations as they hunt for pools of petroleum sawdust gives drill bits something to grind through
7950412 the housing slump has devastated sawmill production across the country

7950444 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point

7950469 india is keen to sign an extradition treaty with bangladesh only but dhaka is not interested as the treaty should involve all members of the regional forum
7950470 since a multi lateral agreement is already in place bangladesh is assessing whether there is any need for a bilateral one with india on exchange of criminals
7950471 india has so far handed over six bangladeshi criminals it means that they can nab the other thugs and hand them over to us
7950472 we have decided to cancel all functions of the pio since it drew severe criticism and protest
7950473 we stopped the pio functions on august 24 to honour political party leaders and people of various sectors

7950479 over four million people in the country may have been pushed back in poverty because of the food crisis
7950480 however the food price shock is projected to have raised poverty rate by around 3 percentage points from the baseline poverty rate of 2005 thus the net impact on poverty of the combined effects of economic growth and the food price shock is likely to have been a decline of 2 percentage points from 40 percent in 2005 to 38 percent in 2008
7950481 a 60 percent increase in the price of rice alone as has happened in the last 12 months erodes nearly one fifth of the income of a poor household increases in prices of other key food items compounded this loss in real income of the poor
7950482 increasing productivity is the only option in a country like bangladesh where every year over 2 million people are added to the population while the availability of cultivable land is decreasing by one percent
7950483 you dont produce oil so you have to import it from the international market it is an economic decision whether you can import it at a cheaper cost or you want to produce everything
7950484 it has been proven that free trade is beneficial to everyone the reason behind this we all find useful things in it think about rmg you are exporting huge amounts
7950485 whether you rely on your domestic food or trade depends on cost that needs to be critically analyzed then the government on behalf of the people should make a decision
7950486 i admit that you have been hurt and i apologise for that
7950487 i regret that we have failed in the democratic journey we started with my late wife benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif we had some successes together we elected a prime minister and defeated a dictator

7950498 it took me about half an hour to create the 3d model where it would have taken me a week to do it before
7950499 it allows you to work quickly and answer tons of questions about your design in three dimensions that you wouldnt be able to answer as well by drawing it out on a board
7950500 has proven tricky especially when much of the required data lives in proprietary design systems
7950501 the level of detail may not be there if you want to design a microprocessor or the details of an engine for example
7950502 we were driving a lot to get to clients and show them designs
7950503 driving so many miles to build an environmentally sound home was counterintuitive
7950504 we can invite clients inside the design concept instead of just showing them two dimensional drawings
7950505 it gives customers a whole new kind of visualization theres nothing like being able to walk into what could be your home
7950506 second life has transformed the way i think about design
7950507 even though i can pen and ink a design i come up with i often find myself jumping into second life to model it the designs are free and it takes half the time to make the models with the in world set of building tools
7950508 providing this notice is clearly a tactic employed by nuance in light of its failed proposal to acquire zi last week at a low valuation
7950509 the timing of this motion is highly suspicious and is an unnecessary legal tactic by nuance
7950510 perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price
7950511 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7950512 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7950513 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house
7950514 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7950515 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7950516 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7950517 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7950518 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7950519 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out
7950520 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7950521 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7950522 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness

7950535 flying her to him for private minutes and whatnot basically putting together her solo project behind the rest of theres back
7950536 considering issues like deployment of law enforcement personnel and maintaining law and order the election commission has decided to hold upazila polls on two different dates
7950537 the commission does not want to take any risk regarding maintaining law and order
7950538 the reality is that requisition will continue in this manner because nobody will take the initiative
7950539 among the police laws it is one of the black laws and also one of the bad jobs of the police department
7950540 the police had to do it for the greater interests of the country despite sufferings of the citizens
7950541 there is no alternative to it as the government has neither sufficient vehicles nor enough fund to purchase more to meet the requirement
7950542 earlier we couldnt compensate the owners and provide meal allowances to the drivers and helpers for lack of fund weve submitted a proposal to the government seeking allocation of tk 5 25 crore annually in this regard
7950543 the bus transport sector is severely being hampered due to requisition system as at least 80 buses of the companies always remain requisitioned but we never get the compensation and the meal allowances
7950544 to avoid harassment we always provide around 80 buses to the dmp the government itself should arrange the necessary transport to its agencies
7950545 in the name of requisition the police officials often harass us
7950546 they do whatever they want and also often collect money from us
7950547 the case remains pending for years but i am carrying out the procedures
7950548 though there were laws for providing compensation there was no regular allocation the government on different occasions paid some amount which was not sufficient
7950549 the owners often do not come to receive their compensation considering it as harassment since they have to wait for months
7950550 we did not allow them to come out of the campus for agitation but since they did it cases have been filed to deal with it
7950551 tarique has temperature and the right side of his head has swollen
7950552 but nothing can be said for sure before 48 hours
7950553 i have talked to him he did not complain of any problem
7950554 hes not in the prison cell of the hospital now hes staying in a cabin
7950555 we demand that the government sends tarique rahman abroad within a day or two considering his serious illness
7950556 despite the high courts recommendation and repeated demands of tariques doctors the government has yet to take any effective step for sending him abroad
7950557 the dollar index has shown that it can at time override the oil fundamentals and will probably dominate until gustav defines a more definitive path
7950558 but the market is reacting to it and edging up
7950559 if youre not excited about this you have no pulse
7950560 it gives you a chance to go outside the league its something new and different it gives you added exposure added games it gives the fans a chance to see something different its added visibility for everyone so for you not be excited you have to be almost dead
7950561 theres a spirit and an energy in the locker room everyones excited about it because were not only representing the impact but canada in general
7950562 a lot is standing on this game for the pride and reputation of the club and canada
7950563 i wouldnt say the season is gone just because we spent a couple of days in last place
7950564 a lot of people are saying how bad the impact is doing but we can still finish in third or fourth place which is good considering where weve been this year
7950565 we have some guys that live in similar countries and others who have been to similar countries
7950566 its not going to be much of an adjustment if any
7950567 its not like were going to play at altitude or something like that we just have to be careful about little things like nutrition but were only going to stay at the hotel and go to the stadium to play
7950568 sierra your parents involvement in the pta benefited you and every other student in that school

7950577 please respect his familys grief and privacy at this time
7950578 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7950579 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7950580 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
7950581 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
7950582 i said earlier my experience may help a little and that definitely may have been the difference on one or two points in the match

7950587 without the cards expats will face difficulties dealing with all sorts of transactions with government and private entities as their status will be illegal
7950588 schools will not accept admission of their children and their employers will be taken to task for recruiting them
7950589 by professionals we mean any university degree holder other than labourers
7950590 under the labour law employers must bear all charges for governmental transactions for their workers
7950591 the id card will eventually replace the labour card whose cost is borne by the employer
7950592 the australian funding was provided to the hellenic red cross special emergency fund for victims of fire for the general purpose of helping with the relief effort
7950593 immediately after the fires the municipality asked us to use this money for construction of a town hall because it was the request of all the local representatives
7950594 i remember when i went to zaharo i was received warmly and made an honorary citizen
7950595 i was asked to do this and it is something i agreed to do
7950596 when we found out from the australian government something was not ok with the permits it was too late and the project had started
7950597 however i requested on 20 june 2008 from the municipality of zaharo that all work should be stopped on this project until the situation was cleared up
7950598 i declare categorically that the intent of the greek red cross was and is relief for the fire victims and if someone has acted illegally in this particular instance we reserve every legal right
7950599 cancelled due to bidding activity that took place without the account owners authorization
7950600 unfortunately it is not possible for us to automatically relist these items for you instead to relist these items you will need to start from the beginning of the listing process we know that this is an inconvenience and we apologize for the negative impact it may cause you we are working on tools to allow you to relist your items without starting from the beginning but they are not available at this time
7950601 the current process where we cancel the listing is optimized around immediately refunding the sellers full fees listing fee and final value fee we realize that this solution can also have its drawbacks specifically the inconvenience to the seller of having their listing removed and also the inability to offer second chance offers to any underbidders which is way ebay is always looking for ways to improve its services to its users
7950602 may have received an unauthorized payment we have placed a temporary hold on the funds until the investigation is complete
7950603 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7950604 is in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and was never supposed to perform at that show
7950605 tottered around the stage dancing tentatively and doing nothing that sounded or looked like real live singing
7950606 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7950607 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7950608 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7950609 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7950610 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7950611 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7950612 she knew president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7950613 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7950614 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7950615 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7950616 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7950617 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7950618 as far as the democratic party this is going to be historic
7950619 when a catholic picks up the phone and hears from sister mary margaret especially the ones who went to catholic school they sit up straight and listen
7950620 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7950621 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7950622 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
7950623 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senators patriotism and commitment to the rule of law
7950624 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7950625 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
7950626 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7950627 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
7950628 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7950629 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7950630 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7950631 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7950632 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7950633 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7950634 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7950635 would come up from the mines after 12 hours and play football
7950636 im in the race to stay im in the race to win and here i come
7950637 i think i probably have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7950638 i went to law school on a full academic scholarship
7950639 graduated in the top half of his law school class
7950640 las investigaciones primarias de ese caso est n pr cticamente en la fase finales
7950641 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7950642 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7950643 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7950644 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7950645 there is absolutely no connection between joe biden and this lawsuit the case is without merit and it will be dismissed
7950646 he provided cover to other democrats to do what the credit industry was urging them to do
7950647 senator biden has a 35 year record fighting for people against powerful interests whether its drug companies oil companies or insurance companies
7950648 he took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes in the bankruptcy bill but legislating requires compromise senators cast tough votes congress worked on the bankruptcy bill for nearly a decade over five congresses to forge a bipartisan compromise
7950649 senator biden took on entrenched interests and succeeded in improving the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments senator biden had to make the tough calls and voted to pass a bill
7950650 it just so happens that the people who find themselves in terrible economic circumstances through no fault of their own major medical bills they have lost their jobs or there has been a divorce it is my view as a former political scientist and now a senator for the state of minnesota that those people do not have the same kind of clout that mbna corporation has
7950651 spreading hope the congressional leadership awards in the fight against hiv aids
7950652 the drivers for change are coming from the democratic party
7950653 there is a country where a new epidemic a new infection happens every nine minutes
7950654 there is a city where one out of 20 people are infected with hiv that country is the united states and that city is washington d c
7950655 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7950656 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7950657 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7950658 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7950659 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7950660 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7950661 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
7950662 to be honest i dont really want to say which teams i want to draw in the past i said i wanted to play milan and it happened
7950663 i also said id like to draw barcelona and it happened if i say this time maybe it wont happen
7950664 what i can say is that i dont think we want to play benfica or milan again all i want to do is play against some of the best clubs in the tournament
7950665 i watch those teams a lot especially the premier league sides so maybe that would be good
7950666 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7950667 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7950668 the market almost always marks time ahead of a fed announcement and the minutes coming out later has people on the sidelines
7950669 use of playstation network has been suspended please try again later
7950670 people shouldnt be afraid of their governments governments should fear their people
7950671 war market district has rippling flags around center node structure
7950672 our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 reflect difficult market conditions for our industry
7950673 the combination of much higher costs and the imbalance between domestic supply and demand in the foodservice markets resulted in much lower margins
7950674 viewers were disgusted that a mother of two young girls would use such foul language
7950675 its just hype and never actually listen to the guys plans
7950676 it shatters the fundamental system of international relations formed not just in the last decade but over the past century and this precedent could lead to an unforeseen chain of events the people who did this mis calculated the consequences of their actions in the end theyll face a backlash head on
7950677 not only in my opinion but i think in all of our opinions this contradicts the principle of territorial integritiy which is an international right and that is why it is absolutely unacceptable
7950678 the rest of the european union would very clearly stand by this principle
7950679 we need to speak with russia on this basis in the future and this must be the message of next mondays special summit we cannot simply go on as if nothing has happened
7950680 relatively optimistic that the emergency eu summit called for on september 1 would find a common voice in reaction to the conflict

7950685 cuando el presidente afirma que puede hacer realidad cualquier sue o deber a ser m s prudente y comenzar por hacer realidad cosas tan sencillas como el desbloqueo administrativo de proyectos que siguen enrocados y que afectan al futuro de la provincia
7950686 llevan camino de hacer realidad un modelo de comunitat donde la provincia de castell n s lo contempla de lejos los grandes eventos y las grandes inversiones que se residencian en valencia y alicante

7950691 reitera su apuesta por dar un fuerte impulso al arbitraje cooperativo como f rmula de resoluci n de conflictos de forma extrajudicial

7950694 la insumisi n de la generalitat deja fuera de la legalidad a los empresarios y pone en riesgo la seguridad de los trabajadores a costa de hacer pol tica contra el gobierno central
7950695 si se han tomado las medidas para informar a los empresarios y facilitarles el cumplimiento de los plazos de la normativa
7950696 es lamentable que el pp est agravando la incertidumbre y la inseguridad que se ciernen sobre las empresas de la contrucci n en unos momentos en los que este sector requiere sensatez y responsabilidad por parte de la generalitat
7950697 econom a y creaci n de empleo son exclusiva del presidente de la generalitat francisco camps

7950700 un mencanismo que busca acreditar la calidad de las empresas de este subsector y del empleo que generan

7950705 multas para las empresas que contraten a firmas sin acreditar cuya cuant a oscila entre 1 500 y los 30 000 euros
7950706 pese al perjuicio que la actitud del equipo de camps podr a causar a la empresas valencianas la conseller a de econom a no hizo efectivo este registro hasta el ltimo d a 25 de julio colocando a la comunitat entre las ltimas en aplicar la ley
7950707 deben inscribirse todas las empresas que deseen intervenir como contratistas o subcontratistas en el sector de la construcci n
7950708 cualquier empresa que quiera acometer obras excavaciones movimientos de tierra rehabilitaciones montajes o simples saneamientos debe figurar en el registro de empresas acreditadas de la autoridad laboral correspondiente a la comunidad aut noma donde radique su domicilio social
7950709 cualquier sociedad que pretenda convertirse en contratista o subcontratista del sector de la construcci n aunque realicen tareas de otros sectores como carpinter a soldadura o trabajos mec nicos y el ctricos deber contar con esta certificaci n al menos un mes antes de la fecha del comienzo de las obras
7950710 genere inseguridad en la construcci n por puro inter s partidista
7950711 obstaculizar la aplicaci n de una ley del gobierno socialista que pretende ayudar a este sector
7950712 hubo una conversaci n entre los dos presidentes pero nicamente fue una declaraci n de intenciones
7950713 no tenemos ninguna oferta por villa de ning n club por ninguna cantidad

7950715 ser a una buena oferta pero no puedo asegurar que dir amos que si
7950716 acumular la informaci n que entra en lo que tiene que hacer la administraci n central ha permitido hacer los estudio pertinentes que facilitan esta toma de decisiones
7950717 se trata de casos que ya han sucedido que est n resueltos cl nicamente que son de naturaleza leve y que no han aparecido nuevos casos en los ltimos d as
7950718 pero al aparecer en menores de un a o es m s aparatoso

7950725 the decision to go to war was the right one
7950726 i believe president bushs strong rhetorical support for democracy has made a difference by creating space for and emboldening modernizers and moderates
7950727 to have the vets come back and throw their medals back at the government that sent them there john kerrys finest moment and then spending the rest of his life apologizing for it that shook the country to its core
7950728 future expansion of the national park system as well as designation of national wildlife areas or historic districts should be undertaken only with the active participation of state and local governments
7950729 the difference of opinion between this suggestion and our presumptive nominees position
7950730 our mccain representive is agreeing that it could pose a problem
7950731 clinton took all of the clean coal development areas in utah and took it off limits for development
7950732 i think that this is more than just anwr i think some of these other decisions that have been made should be reviewed and revisited and in some cases reversed so this is not just an anwr issue for me this is an issue that hits very close to home
7950733 our job is to provide general agreements that dont hamstring the administration

7950740 el peligro de aumentar los riesgos de contaminaci n del aire y de las aguas marinas y playas sobre todo la de almassora por su cercan a a las industrias contaminantes
7950741 la imposibilidad de compaginar turismo y playa con la industria contaminante se demuestra precisamente cuando ocurren vertidos accidentales como el sucedido la semana pasada o como la rotura de una v lvula en la tuber a de transporte de materias primas desde la zona portuaria que provoc hace unos meses otro escape accidental con emisi n de gases t xicos y amoniaco
7950742 el crecimiento de la industria contaminante sobre todo la petroqu mica pone en riesgo la salud de la poblaci n mas pr xima principalmente por las emisiones atmosf ricas as como el turismo de almassora y castell n ya que sus playas se ven afectadas por este tipo de vertidos que al mismo tiempo que amenazan la salud dan una muy mala imagen
7950743 la hip crita defensa del desarrollo sostenible que pretende ubicar industria contaminante con turismo y playa
7950744 desvirt a el concepto de sostenibilidad que deber a proteger y mantener lo mejor de la costa mediterr nea corrigiendo las graves agresiones al entorno de vida que se ve gravemente deteriorado hasta el punto de poner en riesgo nuestra salud la de nuestros hijos y la de cualquier ciudadano del mundo que pretenda pasar sus vacaciones en nuestras playas

7950879 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7950880 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7950881 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7950882 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law

7950889 barack obama is striking back fiercely and swiftly to stamp out an ad that links him to a 1960s radical eager to demonstrate a far more aggressive response to attacks than john kerry did when faced with the 2004
7950890 obama not only aired a response ad to the spot linking him to william ayers but he sought to block stations the commercial by warning station managers and asking the justice department to intervene

7951050 russia calls on other states to follow its example this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
7951051 on the night of august 8 tbilisi made its choice georgian president mikheil saakashvili opted for genocide with this he single handedly wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetians abkhazian and georgians in one state
7951052 we knew russia would support us after everything our city is ruined but we are so happy they will help us rebuild
7951053 this victory is our right it is the century long dream of the people of abkhazia come into reality
7951054 i pay homage to our mothers who have brought up worthy sons who have given their lives for the sake of their native land
7951055 are part of the international borders of georgia and they will remain so
7951056 we repeatedly called for a return to the negotiating table and did not deviate from this position even after kosovos unilateral proclamation of independence
7951057 contradicts all existing norms of international law it will lead to the unprecedented isolation of russia the by the rest of the world

7951066 kinsella is a modern day machiavelli the mastermind who ran war rooms for jean chretien and dalton mcguinty hes the ultimate political insider the war room has plenty of fascinating insights and is a must read for political junkies
7951067 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
7951068 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
7951069 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids
7951070 i dont want to say hes a genius but theres valuable insights here
7951071 i just got one copy but i plan to get more
7951072 hes canadas james carville a must read if you really want to win you need this book
7951073 i think its pretty silly of marcus trescothick to come out and say it but obviously hes trying to sell some books
7951074 ill think you find that bowlers have been doing things to the ball since cocky was an egg
7951075 one of the reasons why that happens is the legislators always seem to come down on the side of the batsmen
7951076 we saw recently with the ludicrous situation with kevin pietersen changing hands and becoming a left hand batsman they came down on the side of the batsman
7951077 they never seem to come down in favour of the bowlers
7951078 swinging the ball is terribly important to the game of cricket
7951079 it is like legspin bowling to bowl good leg spin you have to pitch the ball up if you pitch the ball up somebody might whack it for four
7951080 youve got to do anything you possibly can to keep swing bowling and legspin bowling in the game of cricket
7951081 the series in 2005 is certainly in my opinion the most memorable test series that ive seen
7951082 so much of that had to do with the fact the ball was swinging if the ball is swinging then the scores arent going to be too big
7951083 he has retired now and he has just written that to sell the book
7951084 ive never heard of that working how much difference could a breath mint make

7951089 we zijn voor niets bang ook niet voor het vooruitzicht van een koude oorlog
7951090 dit is geen makkelijke keuze maar de enige manier om de levens van de mensen in de gebieden te redden
7951091 een regelrechte annexatie van gebieden die deel zijn van georgi
7951092 this desk is designed for writing not for fists dont threaten us with slashing aid do you think that because the us lends us money it is entitled to impose on us what we must do we are grateful for the assistance we have received but we are not to be threatened i am a proud jew three thousand years of culture are behind me and you will not frighten me with threats take note we do not want a single soldier of yours to die for us
7951093 we are now preparing to go daily with our brand new boeing 777s featuring lie flat business class seats from october and offer unprecedented levels of space and comfort which will truly give us an edge over our competitors in the middle east and around the world the move to new yorks jfk airport is in response to passenger demand flying to one of americas premier airports on the us east coast
7951094 look closely and discover the fine details of these life like models each crease and fold is there and the caucasian flesh tone is realistic this hand is a soft rubber like casting of an actual human specimen encasing sturdy wires that allow you to bend the fingers into many plausible positions and a few impossible ones
7951095 when they hunt pidgeot fly on the surface of the water at top speed to catch unsuspecting fish element prey like magikarp
7951096 these anatomically proportional one sixth scale models have over 30 points of articulation allowing them to display virtually the full range of human movement they are constructed of highly durable plastic a display stand is included both male and female heads have generic facial features and the hands are crafted with distinctive expressive fingers to make detailed drawing easier
7951097 with todays order the fcc acted to protect the rights of internet users and set the precedent that unreasonable discriminatory behavior like comcasts will not be tolerated
7951098 it agreed with public interest advocates and technical experts that comcasts conduct violated fcc principles and was not reasonable network management
7951099 this is just my policy but i dont want to give an exclusive character for any particular console
7951100 women think a man once again screwed them over somehow
7951101 if we just threw barack obamas clothes out on the lawn and set them on fire we would get it out of our system and we could all unite
7951102 curfew study hall and doing the right things in the classroom
7951103 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
7951104 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
7951105 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
7951106 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
7951107 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
7951108 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
7951109 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
7951110 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
7951111 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
7951112 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
7951113 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
7951114 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
7951115 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
7951116 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
7951117 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range
7951118 things change pretty quickly coach has done a good job preparing us for it all
7951119 you can kick your leg out just like a pitcher throwing too many pitches you almost have to kind of be on a kick count
7951120 jake is a great long snapper and hes really going to do well with field goals im completely confident with him for all of us to get our timing down
7951121 this is what we think is in our best interest for the long term
7951122 tyrod would benefit from another year of learning and this is our plan for now
7951123 this entire project the hotel the villas and the condos under
7951124 a wonderful hotel in a fantastic part of the world
7951125 this wonderful restaurant imho is the best place to close a deal
7951126 the problem is we dont really have a good answer for how to deal with it
7951127 hes just really into it with the family workshop he went to
7951128 she just got a taste of my new lifestyle we had spent a lot of time together before camp but it was never time like that being active and eating healthy
7951129 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
7951130 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy
7951131 i loved oreos and now i cant even look at that stuff
7951132 it would have been a lot harder i probably would have had a really hard time sticking to the diet and staying motivated
7951133 its really good to know that other people want you to succeed
7951134 we think the aircraft in future will be capable of weeks or months duration
7951135 the yuma proving ground in arizona was an appropriate setting for zephyrs world beating flight as many landmark aviation developments have taken place there in recent years

7951141 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency
7951142 standing on the solid legal foundation established today by the fcc internet users must remain vigilant in defending an open internet
7951143 with todays order the fcc acted to protect the rights of internet users and set the precedent that unreasonable discriminatory behavior like comcasts will not be tolerated
7951144 while the commissions order sets a strong precedent internet service providers still interfere with customers traffic
7951145 the commission and the public must keep a watchful eye on isps to ensure that these practices cease and that other discriminatory practices do not take their place
7951146 only one flaw mars this otherwise exceptionally strong pro consumer order
7951147 having correctly found comcasts arguments unpersuasive and its practices unreasonable the fcc then gives comcast one month to develop a compliance plan and until the end of the year to stop blocking its own customers from doing what they have every legal right to do use p2p peer to peer applications to upload or download legal content while we should certainly celebrate todays order no one should declare mission accomplished until comcasts bittorrent blocking stops for good
7951148 theres a lot of scar tissue in there its really hard to read an mri when theres that much stuff in the way
7951149 if youre looking for a political analysis based on his playing here it is hes confident but not cocky hell take the shot if hes open hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge
7951150 my issue right now is the pain and tolerance both of my doctors have said they dont understand how im playing but i pride myself on being mentally tough well see in the next couple of days thats my thing seeing how my recovery time is i can get out and play but its always the recovery time the next day and the next day
7951151 it has to be one of the three best matches i played in my life
7951152 since the departure of nicky shorey we have been looking to supplement the left hand side of our squad and the signing of chris armstrong has given is the opportunity to do that
7951153 the majority of our fans display exemplary behaviour which is extremely pleasing and i think deserves a huge amount of praise
7951154 it is disappointing when incidents like this occur and i am delighted to say that these occurrences are very rare these days
7951155 the reception went well and the people have welcomed me
7951156 but the main thing is to be on the pitch and show what i can do
7951157 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
7951158 ill go read google news ill go read guardian uk go read our web site and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
7951159 just when you see the most outlandish clip you could ever see somebody introduces something new i just check in periodically just to see how far porn has gone in my absence
7951160 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
7951161 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon
7951162 basically its a dressed up version of making your first film it just happens to be a porn film
7951163 if youre turned on by this then we didnt do our job very well
7951164 i am happy about this move to southampton this will certainly give me a chance to play and i hope i can get some real attention there
7951165 it will be better for me to gain such experience at the senior level
7951166 the championship is a very demanding league and it will be a big lesson during which i can improve a lot
7951167 dramatically improve search results of dynamic web content and rich internet applications rias
7951168 set a guinness world record for most downloads in 24 hours
7951169 this site has many of the features that characterize the best real estate blogs
7951170 we now know that the concepts of goodness greatness wisdom power and glory are incapable of engendering an appreciable revelation we who are basically no less na ve than llull would load the machine differently no doubt with the words entropy time electrons potential energy fourth dimension relativity protons einstein or with surplus value proletariat capitalism class struggle dialectical materialism engels
7951171 one of the proposals being looked at is a card for those who want to work here that would be good for lets say three to five years

7951178 the first press secretary who chose to use the podium as a way to argue the presidents case not just in the presidents words but in his own
7951179 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7951180 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7951181 its encouraging to see the benefit of lower gas prices helping consumers a bit
7951182 unless these storms do some damage it looks like oil is headed a lot lower due to shrinking demand
7951183 while it is far too early for definitive forecasts of its path there is a possibility for it to pass over the western side of cuba and into the gulf of mexico oil producing region next week
7951184 gustav will be the major driver of prices this week
7951185 the track depending how it comes off haiti could have the storm move towards some sensitive production and refining areas
7951186 for all the hand wringing that this storm may cause we should remember that the price sell offs following storm systems that have failed have usually far outpaced the initial run higher
7951187 the strengthening dollar and more bad news for economic growth worldwide are putting downward pressure on prices

7951211 if you replace world with country you are back to the same debate arguably that you have been having about michelle obamas feelings about the country did she give her critics any fodder with that comment
7951212 do you think that you know her saying that she loves america that she loves this country is going to do it for those who questioned her patriotism
7951213 if you replace world with country you are back to the same debate arguably that you have been having about michelle obamas feelings about the country did she give her critics any fodder with that comment
7951214 all sorts of rumors about michelle obama and controversy around her including what was her college thesis about did she use the term whitey something that was never substantiated
7951215 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7951216 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
7951217 what wisconsin bloggers are saying about the democratic national convention
7951218 would allow states to pull their national guard forces out of iraq
7951219 this war should never have happened and certainly should not continue but the cost to the people of wisconsin has been tremendous its been a cost of not getting dollars for education its been the cost of not getting dollars for health care its had real costs to every single taxpayer in wisconsin and yet we as legislators in wisconsin have very little to say about it
7951220 i thought michelle gave the speech she had to give last night it was very well done it was refreshing to hear her talking about the american dream and loving her country
7951221 our therapeutic environments focus on what is right with our residents despite their cognitive and physical challenges
7951222 we do not believe that a persons essential humanity is impacted by forgetfulness confusion disorientation or physical limitations we are careful not to impose mainstream standards of normality on our elders rather throughout our agesong communities we want to create a new standard that celebrates aging as maturing and understands becoming an elder as a goal of life
7951223 the ted kennedy speech was a great moment absolutely but other stuff was wasted there was no message that came out of here look this is the fifth night in a row that weve had a democratic convention since george w bush the most disastrous incompetent and corrupt administration weve had in modern american history and we havent put it front and center i am at loss
7951224 they should have had speakers up there saying excuse me but theres a sense of urgency in the country
7951225 the most disastrous incompetent and corrupt administration weve had in modern american history

7951287 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore

7951296 as long as there has been television there has been channel surfing the advent of dvrs which are now in one of four homes has heightened the rate at which we reach for the remote but its only recently that any true measure of our itchy fingers has emerged last year nielsen rolled out a service that advertisers have long been hankering for the ability to count how many viewers actually stay tuned during commercials now the pricing of airtime depends not only on how many eyeballs a show attracts but also on how many stay glued to the set during breaks the difference can be sizable according to nielsen the average show loses 6 of its viewers during commercials but when viewers watch the shows on their dvrs the loss can be as much as 20 all the program providers are looking at how to position commercials differently to keep viewers tuned in says patricia mcdonough nielsens senior vice president of insights analysis and policy

7951306 50m that would be a good deal but i cannot assure you that we would say yes a part exchange i wouldnt buy any real madrid player
7951307 anything that comes in will be studied but we will be reviewing his contract to allow him to continue in happier fashion
7951308 we have to meet with his agent but i dont know when it is and we cant be too hasty
7951309 the first step anyway is that they must give valencia what they want after that well decide we dont have a non transferable player after all
7951310 weve made a request for information on the ajax striker klaas jan huntelaar and weve received it
7951311 we also have a list of between eight and ten players
7951312 we wanted to sell zigic but it proved impossible and now we have no concrete proposal for his loan
7951313 this is a step forward aimed at strengthening the clubs future in the short term
7951314 this decision taken by the club will surely see us progress and also give the youth squad some chance to progress
7951315 a club like this with a unique model must consolidate in order to keep growing if dont want liverpool or tottenham to come and take our players of potential referring to mikel san jos and yuri berchiche we need to retain players on suitable contracts
7951316 football belongs to the players and if a player says that hes not going then he doesnt go

7951329 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices

7951335 michelle made us love her people cried and cheered as if michelle was running for president now we as democrats delegates women and mothers are invested in the obama family
7951336 the big buzz tonight is michelle obama michelle obama set a new milestone for a potential first lady this evening after today a political wife has to deliver a convention speech as well as her candidate husband and talk about key political issues this is a welcome change
7951337 all day there was a sense of expectation and excitement at the opportunity for many of us to meet michelle obama and hear her speak for the first time
7951338 iowa republican jim leach provided a stunningly honest speech about the limitations of the republican party
7951339 i and the democrats that i have talked with had given up on the idea that bipartisanship could work with the brand of politics practiced by republicans in these less than cordial years under the bush administration tonight leach demonstrated bi partisanship and the dnc accepted him cordially

7951347 senator kennedy and his family are in my thoughts and prayers daily and i know of no better way to communicate my sentiments or to honor my friend than through the undeniable power of music

7951351 the shortage of doctoral students and faculty in accounting is one of the greatest challenges facing accounting education and the accounting profession
7951352 this generous contribution will greatly enhance our efforts to attract qualified doctoral candidates and faculty
7951353 this will give our doctoral students an even greater opportunity to develop their research skills to present their results at academic conferences and submit their papers for review for publication in leading academic journals while at the same time raising the profile of the school of accountancy

7951357 while the existing investments in the pipelines were being adhered to may be newer projects which were at concept stage which were at the backburner may not come to the front burner
7951358 if inflation is an issue till we see inflation easing then it would be unrealistic to expect any easing of monetary policy

7951360 this is something that needs to be addressed if the state continues to be magnet for industry
7951361 our view is that this is something that is best handled at the state level at this point of time

7951363 re emerge as major economic and political powers over the next fifty years or so and china is projected to replace the united states as the worlds largest economy by 2040
7951364 these differences in economic strategy especially as pertains to trade openness stability of export revenues and savings generation capacity are of relevance to the bric countries emerging role as international investors
7951365 on account of its large current account surpluses and large fdi inflows china will also dwarf the other brics in terms of gross external asset accumulation especially if the chinese authorities continue to liberalise inward investment
7951366 if entire salary is paid in host country currency the spendable income part of the salary is protected by the cost of living adjustment but the remaining part is exposed to currency fluctuations
7951367 split pay is a good concept to be adopted by any organisation as it brings in purchasing power parity and employee can save accordingly
7951368 the split salary approach depends on the length of the expatriates assignment for less than six months this is possible but it will be little more complex as the expatriate could remain in the home country for such period and there is no reason why the full salary should not be paid in the home currency

7951453 to assure no school policies or codes are violated and no laws are broken
7951454 one student and mother who did not know objected and asked several people in the school to not publish the picture they were denied
7951455 this mother and student were obviously distraught over as she said the labeling of her child one parent said legal remedies are being explored

7951470 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with seven to eight houses having been destroyed with serious damage to many others
7951471 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7951472 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7951473 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7951474 repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7951475 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7951476 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7951720 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7951721 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7951722 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7951723 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7951724 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help

7951731 when i moved to chennai to bangalore i knew what i wanted here but didnt know if it existed i found frontlinebuilders com on a web search the frontline builders contacted me promptly found me a home i could afford that was truly beyond my wildest dreams and took care of details that i never knew a realtor would handle i could focus on selling my home in chennai and opening my new business office in bangalore i recommended them to my brother when he moved his family here and he just bought his second home through frontline builders these are people you can trust and count on to make the process easier for you they gave me information and advice on things i didnt even know to think of i really cant think of any part of buying my new home that did not exceed my expectations
7951732 i dont know that i can pick a winner because i believe the sec west will be similar to the sec east last year i believe the winner will have two conference losses
7951733 i will stick to what i predicted on espn com my gut feeling is that lsu and auburn are all very capable of winning the west potentially auburns schedule may set up a little bit more favorably i am not necessarily saying alabama is the best team in the west but im going with a little bit of a gut feeling that they might emerge from a tie in the sec west
7951734 lsu and auburn dont have a lot of experience at quarterback i know that alabama quarterback has taken a lot of grief but hes got an experienced offensive coordinator in who is a very quarterback friendly guy mcelwain aided and facilitated monumental improvement in fresno states tom brandstarter if he could do similar things for wilson that would give alabama has an edge i know that john parker has made some game changing mistakes but hes been through a lot of the wars he has talent and some weapons around him if he gets some improvement from the offensive line which is strongly needed i think that his experience could be the difference in the west
7951735 in the west that is easy for me my enthusiasm for them has been tempered a bit because of their injuries on the defensive line but i think its houston nutts arrival should inject some enthusiasm into the program coach o had plenty of that but nutt has won a lot of games in this league he takes over a roster that is more talented that they are given credit for by most people the injuries to peria jerry put a damper on that prediction because i thought the ole miss defensive line might be one of the best in the sec and still might be by the end of the season with all due respect to lsu who has the defensive line that others dream about in the sec
7951736 if you go down the list of quarterbacks in the sec and im not talking about experience level or years in the system
7951737 predictions are a dangerous thing because no matter what you say or do in our line of work people remember the predictions after picking them to win the east last year i hesitate to go back to the well with south carolina but im going to do so anyway i like their defense but im skeptical of their offense which sounds bad to say with as much admiration that i have for s offensive acumen i question their quarterback situation im not sure that they really have game changers in the backfield but i know they have some pretty good receivers however i am picking them because of the experience they have on defense and taking over as defensive coordinator and a little bit of a shakeup with having steve spurrier junior call plays and their favorable schedule three of their big games georgia lsu and tennessee are at home
7951738 ohio state has a bit of a bad rap despite being a very talented team they didnt play their best game against a very talented florida team a few years ago but i thought they played pretty well against lsu i dont know when it became shameful to make it to the national championship game two years in a row the big ten is down but ohio state is head and shoulders above those teams
7951739 ill be watching very carefully on sept 13 when ohio state goes to s c to get a reading on how they respond in a big game if they go to usc and lose a close game and then run the table in the big ten and their only loss is to usc in a tight game should they be held out of the national championship game based on strength of conference come on i just dont believe that
7951740 for a preseason top five team no team is flying under the radar like oklahoma theres talk about florida and georgia and clemson oklahoma is just sitting there and no one is talking about them
7951741 they have all those studs on the defensive line like auston english who was as good of a pass rusher as anyone in the conference last year they have back in the secondary which was a sore point for them last year but i think they will be improved quarterback tim tebow in quarterback efficiency the offensive line which i think is the best in america will all be back i think coach colorado game last year i believe they will be in the national championship game
7951742 if i had to choose a winner then it would be oklahoma
7951743 well be with you mark may lou holtz and i will be manning the studio all year long well get on the road early for the tennessee

7951749 in the unfortunate event that mr olson succeeds in the september primary
7951750 i would ask that our party refuse to offer any type of assistance to his campaign while the loss of a state senate seat is unfortunate we must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support or the support of voters in senate district 16

7951779 and the jinn we created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire
7951780 and i allah created not the jinns and men except that they should worship me alone
7951781 o ye assembly of jinns and men came there not unto you messengers from amongst you setting forth unto you my signs and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say we bear witness against ourselves it was the life of this world that deceived them so against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected faith
7951782 soon shall we settle your affairs o both ye worlds
7951783 o ye children of adam let not iblis satan seduce you in the same manner as he got your parents out of the garden stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them we made the devils i e evil jinn friends only to those without faith
7951784 the jinn are of three types a type that has wings and they fly through the air a type that looks like snakes and dogs and a type that stops for a rest then resumes its journey i e they appear to be nomadic
7951785 by allah i will take you to the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him
7951786 i will take you to the messenger of allah this is the third time and each time you say that you will not come back then you come back
7951787 let me go and i will teach you something by means of which allah will benefit you
7951788 he told you the truth although he is a liar do you know who you have been speaking to for three nights o abu hurayrah
7951789 these privies public bathrooms are frequented by the jinns and devils i
7951790 when night falls then keep your children close to you for the devils spread out then an hour later you can let them free and close the gates i e doors of your house at night and mention allahs name thereupon i e bismillah and cover your utensils i e foods and mention allahs name thereupon and if you dont have something to cover your utensil you may put across it something e g a piece of wood etc
7951791 someone from among the jinn called me and i went with him and recited quran for them
7951792 you can have every bone on which the name of allah has been mentioned that comes into your possession as meat and all the droppings as food for your animals
7951793 so do not use these things for cleaning yourselves after relieving oneself for they are the food and provision of your brothers
7951794 say it has been revealed to me that a company of jinns listened to the quran
7951795 i have seen the spirit or ghost of so and so
7951796 there is not one of you who does not have a jinn appointed to be his constant companion
7951797 me too but allah has helped me and he has submitted so that he only helps me to do good
7951798 i greeted him with salaams peace and he returned my greeting then i asked him what are you a jinn or a human

7951846 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7951847 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7951848 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7951849 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7951850 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7951851 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7951852 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7951853 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7951854 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7951855 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7951856 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7951857 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7951858 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7951860 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

7951864 i said earlier my experience may help a little and that definitely may have been the difference on one or two points in the match
7951865 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7951866 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7951867 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7951868 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7951869 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7951870 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7951871 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7951872 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7951873 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7951874 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7951875 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7951876 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7951877 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7951878 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7951879 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7951880 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7951881 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7951882 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7951883 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7951884 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7951885 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7951886 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7951887 gt time magazine seeks to prove its still edgy relevant

7951889 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7951890 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7951891 there are two choices in this election obama and hillary clinton or mccain and bush
7951892 why did you get a tattoo of goofy dribbling a basketball
7951893 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7951894 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7951895 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7951896 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7951897 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7951898 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7951899 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7951900 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7951901 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7951902 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7951903 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7951904 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7951905 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senators patriotism and commitment to the rule of law
7951906 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7951907 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
7951908 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7951909 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7951910 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7951911 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7951912 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7951913 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7951914 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7951915 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7951916 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7951917 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7951918 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7951919 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7951920 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7951921 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7951922 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7951923 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7951925 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7951926 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7951927 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7951928 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7951929 i think were being punished for being a red state
7951930 the consensus is the closer you are the more important you are
7951931 the only worse thing would be to sit outside and watch it on a big screen
7951932 i would hope they arent putting more emphasis on guam and alaska
7951933 we really deserve the better position because were the true believers the die hards
7951934 este verano el deporte m s peligroso es la bicicleta
7951935 janet jackson sparked controversy by showing the world her wonderful glorious nipple during the super bowl
7951936 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7951937 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7951938 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7951939 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7951950 pesakit itu pula dilihat mengerang kesakitan setiap kali kemaluannya disentuh dalam usaha menanggalkan cincin itu
7951951 keadaan kemaluan mangsa yang membengkak merumitkan usaha menanggalkan cincin itu malah kedudukannya pada pangkal kemaluan menyukarkan untuk memotong
7951952 kami terpaksa menggunakan pemotong besi bagi memutuskan cincin berkenaan tugas berkenaan dilakukan dengan penuh berhati hati sebelum cincin terbabit dapat dipotong dalam tempoh tak sampai seminit
7951953 anggota bomba yang terlatih dan cermat berjaya memotong cincin itu dengan hanya sekali percubaan

7951963 an actors personal life does not relate to a film the audience liked the chemistry of the characters of raj and radhika played by myself and bipasha it is more about the script maybe tomorrow deepika and i will do another romantic film in the future and it will look better than this one
7951964 its the video very hot haan my god i dont even know why shes sherlyns linking me with a hot hot thing shes trying to change her image maybe with my name if shes doing this poor thing i wish her success for all those who see nudity will be happy but my name is hema malini and that wont change for anything
7951965 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity on her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
7951966 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis

7951972 im just afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone
7951973 be that as it may we have no idea if we can even get into the outpost nor do we have any idea how to work its systems for all we know it could destroy your ship on arrival you yourself said these people may have been more advanced than the ancients themselves
7951974 i doubt that would happen how else would the ancients have set foot in it if it would blow ships up as soon as they come in range besides from what i read they were a peaceful race at some parts more peaceful than the ancients themselves
7951975 still i find it risky to send a ship to investigate an outpost that may have been destroyed or captured and even if it is intact and powered we have no idea how to interface to its systems nor is their any proof that we will even be able to decipher their language as i recall you said they came a very long way through that natural wormhole
7951976 besides if their gate security system is anything as you said it was it has got to be worth a look even if we cant interface with it
7951977 well we can bring it up with colonel caldwell who should be due back in a few hours if he agrees to go there i will give you permission to go
7951978 however on the first sign of trouble i want you to evacuate and then forget about going back is this clear
7951979 never thought i see the day that rodney was quiet like that
7951980 very well i just hope i didnt just made a mistake in allowing you all to go if he agrees
7951981 you said these people were at least as advanced as the ancients were maybe more advanced how do you know this for sure
7951982 while i dont have any concrete evidence that states they are more advanced or as advanced i did mention a small log left by tactical personnel of the ship that made first contact with them advising that this race should not be aggravated in any way lest they make an enemy out them now this coming from a experienced tactical officer of an ancient warship does tell a lot especially when stated in such a way
7951983 i must confess that if the ancients leave such a message with mention of a certain race of people that its certainly worth the look
7951984 and if we were to find some cool weapons or other stuff we can use we might as well take care of it since the place is abandoned after all
7951985 well i dont mind taking a look beats hanging around here doing nothing
7951986 well if you all think its a good idea to take a look i dont mind were moving the last supplies down to the city now when were done we can leave i guess this will be in about 20 minutes
7951987 well then i guess its settled then i wish you all good luck in acquiring new technology however at the first sign of trouble i want you all to return also check if there is any indication that the outpost might have owners after all if so you are to at least contact us first before making contact
7951988 sir all supplies intended for atlantis have been beamed down and we are ready to leave in a few minutes
7951989 good prepare to beam up dr jackson dr mckay sheppard ronon and teyla and do so when they report ready to beam out
7951990 major marks set a course for the draconian outpost and get us into hyperspace
7951991 commander we should be at the planet in about 2 hours and 33 minutes
7951992 im picking up increasing traffic in subspace both communications and what appears to be vessels traveling through it in some kind of ftl drive
7951993 its the first time ive seen races that travel through subspace as a means of ftl travel of course assuming that this is just one race do you got any specifics kirnala
7951994 it seems to be quite normal to the races in this galaxy commander as i am detecting multiple typed of ships moving through the subspace tunnels they make with their ftl drives
7951995 rishka open a long range transmission to the m risia and send them the info we have gathered so far
7951996 shadow we have received a long range communications channel from the mirnara they are sending us information about unusual subspace activity
7951997 subspace as a means of ftl travel i believe its possible although i do think its rather inefficient what do think m risia sakara
7951998 how the hell did you know i was there and for how long did you notice
7951999 i noticed from the second you dampened your presence back when you entered the last corridor to the bridge
7952000 also i see that you are off duty so why arent you sleeping
7952001 too notice from that distance and not be the slightest detectable yourself normally youd think your presence was to be felt when sensing out more strongly anyways about the subspace ftl thingie i guess its feasible id have to run some simulations but i think i could replicate the system
7952002 i also think its quite possible to modify our hyperwarp engines to allow for subspace travel although as you said shadow i do support the fact that it might be very inefficient compared to the estimated power to enter and maintain a subspace conduit than that it does to maintain hyperwarp even if it may or may not be slower
7952003 i thought so well no need to modify our drives to travel less efficient i say
7952004 do keep it in the database though it might come in handy someday
7952005 heh good night sakara im going to stay here for a while then maybe work in a lab or on some training in the training simulators
7952006 just dont blow up half the deck like you did last time while training against holographic enemies its makes it hard to sleep when stuff blow up around here
7952007 if i dont blow it up can i have cookie afterwards
7952008 and act like our commander for once would you your still on the bridge for crying out loud
7952009 were dropping out of hyperspace in 5 4 3 2 1 we have entered the system of the outpost sir
7952010 sir im detecting a structure along the equator of the planet
7952011 it seems about as large as one of our 302 bays sir although i am unable to determen if the structure extends underground it does however seem abandoned and im getting slight readings that a stargate might be present there
7952012 the computer cant identify it correctly cause of some kind of interference
7952013 no its only in a very select area that i cant seem to scan the rest is perfectly clear on scanners ive already located what appears to be a larger room of sorts to beam you in to
7952014 if you guys are ready you can beam down immediately
7952015 well seeing how the lights are out i doubt it
7952016 now i only hope i can interface with this stuff
7952017 incredible these holographic consoles can be touched like you would a laptop
7952018 what does it matter it seems like its jelly or something like it
7952019 when i first poked it with my gun it was as soft as jelly so i thought id hit it with a punch to find out that the stuff was as hard as a trinium bulkhead
7952020 what the hell now its as hard as a rock all of a sudden
7952021 the sensors have detected 5 wraith ships heading towards us in hyperspace 2 hives and 3 cruisers to be exact estimated time of arrival is 34 seconds
7952022 thats fast contact our people and have them make ready for beam out when they are onboard raise shields and arm weapons
7952023 we came across some kind of jelly like substance that becomes hard if you punch it or apply high force to it
7952024 i see well your reports are going to have to wait as weve got incoming wraith ships
7952025 target the closest hive ship and fire asgard beam weapons
7952026 i am detecting 6 no 5 vessels in high orbit around our target location 4 of them seem to be firing at another vessel which is defending itself
7952027 you think that place might be a war zone rishka
7952028 it is possible commander seeing how we know little of the politics of this galaxy however it seems that the single vessel is stronger than the others as it has destroyed or disabled at least 2 other ship while we are discussing this
7952029 very well ready for dropping out of the rift conduit
7952030 sir these wraith have somehow upgraded their weapons our shields are at 13 and weve lost asgard beam weapons and hyperdrive we have destroyed the 2 hives and 2 cruisers and rail guns are firing on the last one but are having little to no effect your orders sir
7952031 set a course away from them at maximum sub light maybe we ca
7952032 sir reading some kind of massive tear in space to our starboard bow
7952033 i have no idea the computer registers it as some kind of wormhole but cant classify it it also doesnt look like any wormhole ive ever seen the one thing that is certain is that its artificial
7952034 artificial your saying that whatevers tearing space apart there is artificial
7952035 its the name of the ship look its written on the side in a batch of silver kns 164 mirnara the bigger question for me is why is it written in english
7952036 i dont know maybe its a serial number of some kind
7952037 sir the unknown ship is broadcasting a signal on all frequencies
7952038 this is the kns mirnara to unknown vessels cease fire immediately and retreat to your respective planets enough blood has been shed today
7952039 cease fire but keep our best shielded side towards the wraith i have more trust in this mirnara and its commander than i trust the wraith even if i dont know this unknown vessel at all
7952040 yes sir ceasing all fire and turning best shield towards the wraith
7952041 diplomatically it was the most sound decision to make showing them that you are willing to cooperate always goes far as diplomacy is concerned
7952042 the wraith are not listening to the unknown ship sir
7952043 this is the kns mirnara to unknown organic vessel cease fire now or we will make you stop
7952044 i have a feeling the wraith are not going to listen to them
7952045 those kind of shields could well have the potential to out perform the shields of atlantis during a long siege the structure of the shield allow it to dissipate the damage much more effectively and still only getting the honeycomb that was hit damaged that is amazing to say the least
7952046 this is the kns mirnara to unknown organic vessel cease fire immediately or we will retaliate with the full force of our weapons
7952047 seems like the wraith are getting an ass whipping soon
7952048 reading an energy buildup in one of the weapon turrets of the mirnara its firing

7952059 i believe if we put in that performance every week then there will be nobody who can touch us
7952060 the display we put in saw us get back to all the good things we were doing in pre season
7952061 we closed down the opposition when they had the ball and created plenty of chances ourselves
7952062 it was as if i put the hardest one to score away
7952063 im kicking myself a bit because i had several chances created for me
7952064 well thats all right and good but beer kits call for two pounds of fermentable sugars and he only added the one pound of malt

7952079 using a hand held mobile is just pure laziness with the amount of bluetooth options out there theres just no excuse
7952080 i think it is a combination of factors people are trying to make up for lost time stuck in traffic by trying to do things on the run like eating and putting on make up
7952081 people get blas about these things but one moment s lack of concentration could mean the end of your life or someone elses
7952082 you could be charged with dangerous or negligent driving causing death

7952216 i know firsthand from my parents lives and mine that the american dream endures
7952217 and isnt that the great american story its the story of men and women determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7952218 i stand her today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7952219 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7952220 so tired and disappointed in the direction of the country
7952221 still struggling in this nation with a level of cynicism and fear that is drowning
7952222 oh do you want to see some of my work
7952223 the owner wanted a theme based around archipelago and islands so i went with painting islands and mermaids in a mix of ukiyo e and french line work
7952224 well i got into ero manga 15 years ago at the time i was looking for a job and i was approached by an editor while at comiket because he really liked my work
7952225 oh id love to go back to comiket sometime its so much fun there
7952226 i like to focus on women having pleasure in my manga theres plenty of ero magazines for men where they can just sit there and read it in public but women cant do that its too embarrassing so i want to draw something that women can look at and find pleasure with
7952227 youve been at this for more than 15 years is there anything you wont draw
7952228 its really not something thats pleasurable for women really its the pent up sexual frustration of someone who doesnt really have much if any experience with women that draws this sort of stuff
7952229 it would be about all the different types of people here in new york city each with their own lives and relationships it would focus on the sex these people have because you can tell who a person really is through sex you can see when theyre angry or frustrated full of anxiety or just plain happy and not just heterosexuals either bi sexual and homosexual sex is a part of life here in the city so i would want to explore that too
7952230 no ill definitely be going back to japan to do this
7952231 what i tell them is to just find someone you like and imitate them youll eventually grow into your own style from there i tell them

7952256 how has music changed in the last 50 years and how will it change in the next 50 years to what extent does that affect our choirs
7952257 the percentage of people in your church who have ever been in a choir is at the highest it will ever be
7952258 we are going to have to work harder to recruit people
7952259 choirs can stir more passion than just one person alone and often more than a praise team can
7952260 the choir is a strong testimony to the congregation because the choir represents the greatest cross section of your congregation
7952261 choirs also give worship leaders the opportunity to involve more people in leading worship
7952262 and its almost impossible to duplicate the energy that a large group of excited people brings to a service
7952263 the cultures changing and it will be challenging to grow a choir

7952280 there are two ways to make an inexpensive laptop one way is to take cheap components cheap labor cheap design and make a cheap laptop
7952281 we decided to do the opposite cool design and very advanced manufacturing techniques where you pour raw materials in one end and out come ipods out the other end that approach is normally not the one taken in the developing world

7952484 one thing in politics i think you can like all the candidates
7952485 sure we like lets be realistic barack obamas opponent you like him but you dont have to vote for him
7952486 we can like anyone but when it comes to voting you want to vote for the person that you truly believe in
7952487 we do like hillary clinton we respect her for what shes accomplished
7952488 come back and join the ranks in supporting the candidate that won fairly honestly and openly in the primary
7952489 i firmly believe that all those delegates are going to support with enthusiasn with enthusiasm working for barack obama

7952499 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
7952500 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
7952501 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7952502 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
7952503 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome

7952611 this is a great honor being nominated vice president of the united states and i am proud of it
7952612 i dont mean in any way to diminish it but it pales in comparison to the honor that ive had representing you
7952613 i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys i mean it sincerely
7952614 i am excited to be on a team and i dont use those terms ive never been team

7952620 you could argue that indians tipped the balance in the senate
7952621 obama had better mention indian people thursday night in his speech
7952622 i mean it hed better mention indian people thursday night he needs to recognize us in his speech
7952623 for hillary to get as far as she did its a blessing it shows we can break away from oppression that we can think feel and be politicians as good as anyone
7952624 im not an asshole but i play one on tv
7952625 at first i didnt liked hodges actually i quite hated him because he seems a bit more arrogant an ass kisser and why not say it a perfect picture for the concept of
7952626 and by the way i have watched the show faithfully ever since it first came out
7952627 but ive always said i am not the star of the obama family

7952629 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
7952630 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s
7952631 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology
7952632 syrias bad negotiating position with israel is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7952638 were going to hire four people here and two people in houston over the next 30 days
7952639 one of them actually asked me why i had bought 65 hectares of rock
7952640 although there was a substantial farmhouse the original farm outbuildings had been neglected and the barns had been built in the wrong position
7952641 it took just three days to crush enough rock for the barn bases
7952642 and even though we purchased 1 500 of cement we saved at least 5 000 on materials that would have had to be purchased and brought onto the site we soon realised the potential of the buckets for demolition work but we are finding we can utilise them on more and more agricultural applications as well
7952643 even in the summer it was too soft to use as grazing land
7952644 the soil has dried out and it is awaiting sowing with grass seed for a silage crop
7952645 dont you think theyd love to bankrupt us as we did to them in the cold war

7952714 the united states only has 3 of the proven reserves
7952715 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7952716 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7952717 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7952718 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
7952719 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
7952720 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rates in children and for the fall in uninsured rates in the general population
7952721 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million
7952722 you just see the difference the new massachusetts health reform plan has made in improving coverage
7952723 45 7 million people who are uninsured is still a major problem there is no cause for celebration that we only have 45 7 million uninsured there is still a very serious problem the most serious problem we have in the health sector

7952737 were thankful no one got hurt but at the same time we are looking for any help from the public to solve this crime
7952738 i always say to myself what is the most important thing we can think about at this extraordinary moment
7952739 we know from over a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort sea oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon
7952740 there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the ice sea and tundra
7952741 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg
7952742 with the retreat of polar ice increasing navigability of the northwest passage and the growing global interest in arctic resources canada faces unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented challenges in the north
7952743 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations
7952744 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
7952745 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
7952746 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
7952747 with a more challenging than anticipated economic and consumer environment this quarter our initial expectations for our same restaurant sales performance proved optimistic
7952748 restaurants are clearly susceptible to changes in consumer discretionary spending and therefore we expect valuations will continue to be influenced by fluctuations in energy prices and perceptions regarding the housing market
7952749 while we believe dri will outperform peers its bellwether position within the industry makes it susceptible at least in the foreseeable future to shifts in sentiment toward consumer discretionary stocks which at this point is difficult to predict
7952750 the retail environment continues to be challenging as customers remain increasingly cautious in their spending across the entire retail sector especially in the missy category
7952751 while we anticipate consolidated comparable store sales for the fall season to remain negative we expect to see an improvement in trend and continue to believe we will be profitable in the second half
7952752 the company expects comps to remain negative in the fall season but highlighted that it is pleased with initial reads on its fall offering
7952753 according to nielsen none of you are watching the conventions an even lower none than in 2004 which was itself a dramatic decline from the lackluster ratings of 2000
7952754 under the vienna convention on diplomatic relations article 9 a receiving state may at any time and without having to explain its decision declare any member of a diplomatic staff
7952755 olson was convicted last year 2007 by a sherburne county jury of misdemeanor domestic assault for causing his wife fear of bodily harm when they collided and fell to the ground behind their home in november he was acquitted of intentionally harming or trying to harm her after his attorney argued that he had acted in self defense in an abusive relationship
7952756 in the unfortunate event that mr olson succeeds in the september primary
7952757 i would ask that our party refuse to offer any type of assistance to his campaign while the loss of a state senate seat is unfortunate we must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support or the support of voters in senate district 16

7952774 las autoridades georgianas han desatado un conflicto armado cuyas v ctimas fueron civiles

7952794 la d cision du pr sident medvedev est absolument inacceptable cela contredit le principe de lint grit territoriale comme droit fondamental
7952795 je pense que cest regrettable cette d cision place moscou en opposition avec plusieurs r solutions au conseil de s curit de lonu que moscou a pourtant adopt es en tant que membre de lonu conform ment dautres r solutions du conseil de s curit qui sont toujours en vigueur labkhazie et loss tie du sud sinscrivent dans les fronti res internationalement reconnues de la g orgie et il en restera ainsi

7952805 it is essential that our top legislators regardless of party understand the importance of victory in iraq the consequences of defeat and the success of the surge
7952806 sen obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops

7952811 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7952812 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
7952813 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7952814 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7952815 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7952834 it feels like this is the last big party before a general election that the democrats are sure to lose
7952835 its the political equivalent of re arranging the chairs on the deck of the titanic it feels like that because of the polls the pick of joe biden telescoped that barack obama knows his weaknesses he doesnt have experience in foreign policy and he does not connect well to ordinary people and joe biden doesnt fix that he just magnifies the problem hes a fine guy i want him to go back to the senate

7952840 dont you think theyd love to bankrupt us as we did to them in the cold war
7952841 the only way obama loses is if he goes the other way this is a change election and folks are voting democratic because they want change
7952842 my experience with blue dogs is that they are basically strong democrats but they cut the corporations more slack
7952843 so we have to wait and not count our chickens before theyre hatched and right now the blue dogs are very helpful to me on my committee especially on issues of fiscal conservatism we operate on a consensus basis within the caucus so lets see what happens
7952844 i think that women voters and women democrats believe in a proper role for government and the corporate stuff is a bit of a turnoff
7952845 even the women in the coalition have the most progressive voting records for blue dogs by far

7952872 mattel itself had approached the indian courts in february 2008 seeking an order for taking down scrabulous from facebook and other servers
7952873 the honble high court has reserved judgment in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the honble high courts decision mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7952874 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent to them

7952876 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
7952877 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
7952878 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
7952879 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7952880 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7952881 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7952882 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so

7952904 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
7952905 around the time that he gave his speech on race
7952906 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama
7952907 i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago
7952908 and so when people talk about financial issues and the higher cost of education he really gets it
7952909 i think hes the sort of person that inspires us all to be our best selves

7952925 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7952926 the official intensity forecast is increased and now calls for gustav to be a major hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea
7952927 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7952928 serious venture firms are investing in and out of the market cycles because you do have to be there when the markets pop
7952929 as i look for deals and talk to people i have never seen a time in europe when there are so many good young companies being started
7952930 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7952931 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7952932 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7952933 what am i trying to see if their aint nothing in sight why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight
7952934 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7952935 dark days the story of four canadians tortured in the name of fighting terror
7952936 the public for the most part while they know and recognize maher arars name they dont know that there was something far more systematic going on
7952937 i believe that you cant really understand what happened to maher arar without understanding what happened to the other men
7952938 you cant argue this was a series of coincidences or mistakes when you look at all of them together
7952939 when you look at all of them together it demands accountability it demands a review of who knew what when it cant be explained away as just the americans as just coincidence as just the syrians as just mistakes it must be systematic
7952940 this resulted in the focus of the investigation moving from prosecution to more of a disruption exercise whereby the police would assist csis in dismantling a group of alleged terrorists
7952941 particularly since 9 11 we have had to accept going to a disruptive mode because prevention is the most important thing
7952942 everything we know points to these cases being an example of circumventing the normal legal processes the rule of law
7952943 the fact that theyre held in the same detention centre as so many other war on terror suspects from other countries seems to me to point to canadas role in a global diffuse and disrupt strategy we now know the extent to which the u s and cia were doing this does this point to the same strategy happening in canada yes these cases certainly do
7952944 the poster boy for csis incompetence and lax passport controls
7952945 the inquiry is about the action of canadian officials its not about how this unfolded for the men themselves and i think thats an important perspective for canadians to understand
7952946 we do take it seriously and we need to address it
7952947 for companies that want to avoid trouble the first step is to get it on their radar
7952948 a lot of companies dont have this on their corporate checklist
7952949 were really really excited were ordering quite a few bottles of champagne
7952950 who would have thought a mystery series set in 1895 would capture both canadian audiences and international audiences
7952951 i think we all know about csi and weve all seen these cop procedurals before
7952952 this show is the beginnings of where forensics started things that we take for granted like lie detectors or infrared i think the audience is interested in where all of that comes from
7952953 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
7952954 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7952955 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7952956 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
7952957 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
7952958 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
7952959 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
7952960 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
7952961 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7952962 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7952963 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7952964 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7952965 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7952966 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7952967 now that the technology is here we hope to finally do it the way that people who really care about music have always wanted to see it done
7952968 i dont know what ive heard is the media doesnt think there is much hype about it this year and its still the first game so what the hell has happened huh
7952969 get fired up this is the start of the football season
7952970 ive had a lot more years when ive known a lot less than i know about this team
7952971 a lot of years and a lot more years ive had a lot more concerns than ive got this year
7952972 do i have a fear of it hell yes i have a fear of it thats why i dont sleep very well
7952973 even after ive seen it in games i wonder if its going to show up in the next game thats just coaching its an interesting deal just looking at guys and you know what they are physically capable of but you dont know how they are going to respond to all the situations
7952974 for a lot of guys this is going to be their first real experience of playing a lot or starting in a game its on the road itll be noisy itll be a different atmosphere and situation than they have ever been in in their lives how those guys respond is key to the outcome of the game
7952975 let me go back two years ago first we got smoked in the opening game and still ended up going to the music city bowl and beating clemson and ended up 8 5
7952976 last year we had an exciting win over louisville in the third game and ended up with virtually the same end of the season results a music city bowl win father and son its important one to get out of the blocks well and its important because its the rival game win or lose the game doesnt necessarily make the end all for the season or the tell all season but it sure would help winning
7952977 it was relevant a year ago now its just beating a dead horse the game has come and gone who cares
7952978 the game in its current state would not be possible on the 360 period
7952979 screw the ps3 but lets still make a lousy port to get more money
7952980 would put more pressure on the treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the gses
7952981 the treasury would opt for one of the earlier options to avoid such an outcome
7952982 often imitated copied pasted and stolen from but never duplicated
7952983 whether its in a leadership role or in any other capacity i have made it clear to our group that i intend to stay for the duration of the cba talks
7952984 in times of trouble free nations of the world still look to america for leadership because they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
7952985 my opponent had the chance to express such confidence in america when he delivered a much anticipated address in berlin
7952986 he was the picture of confidence in some ways but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same and in that speech senator obama left an important point unclear he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote no challenge too great for a world that stands as one now i missed a few years of the cold war as the guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
7952987 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
7952988 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7952989 i guess we are left to figure out the rest for ourselves
7952990 its unlikely he was alluding to afghanistan the nation we liberated after 9 11 and continue to help despite russian complaints about our related deployments in central asia
7952991 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
7952992 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
7952993 the united states should call for a meeting of the united nations security council to condemn russias decision in coordination with our european allies the u s should lead within the un and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions the osce must also send a serious monitoring group to georgia
7952994 connects it all the panel where the picture comes out the sound the power and all those plugs in the back

7953010 id think that to myself and eat ten baby carrots and id get through it
7953011 the truth is this economy is not working for average americans
7953012 im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me its about you
7953013 its about who is going to be fighting for you who is going to be listening to you who has been for the last 20 years standing side by side with you making sure that unions can organize making sure that people who dont have health insurance can get health insurance making sure that kids can go to college who couldnt go before who has a track record of fighting for you
7953014 need somebody who every single day gets it and understands that youre not looking for a handout that you are willing to work as hard as you can to create a better future for your children all you want is just an american government that is on your side that is making things a little easier that is giving you a few more handles to climb up that ladder of success that is what i want to provide as your president
7953015 over the last eight years your lives are less secure over the last eight years you are more likely to have lost your health insurance over the last eight years you are more likely to not be able to save over the last eight years your home values have started to drop
7953016 thats the track record those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did so if you think that the last eight years have been good then you need to go ahead and vote for john mccain but if you think that we need to change this country fundamentally then i think that you need to get involved in this campaign and help us bring about the kind of change that americas looking for
7953017 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
7953018 816 000 new people fell into poverty in 2007 including 500 0000 more children
7953019 youd think both parties would be scrambling to come up with a way of how do we come up with a new direction
7953020 this is the guy whos got the inside track to be secretary of the treasury
7953021 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person
7953022 i just dont think he gets it i think he is out of touch i dont think he understands what ordinary americans are going through but i do and thats why im running for president
7953023 obama did not mention that median income for u s households grew 1 3 to 50 233

7953028 i would encourage them not to prepay their mortgage especially in a liquidity crunch

7953030 people tell me that they keep a mortgage because its deductible and so i tell them well go have your bank double your mortgage rate and youll get twice as much deduction

7953058 this has definitely been a fascinating time in history to be alive the degree to which technology and the way media is delivered and received has changed so dramatically in such a short period of time that it is truly mind boggling when i finished broadcasting school a few months after that photo was taken i went to work for a little 500 watt am radio station in my home town the owners had spent half a million dollars putting the station on the air and its coverage area only went out a few miles in a very small town with inflation factored in a half million then would be the equivalent of around under 10 download some free software and broadcast to the entire the world with virtually no overhead when i started out you had to get past the gatekeepers station owners publishers general managers etc to work at something you loved to do many talented people never made it through the minefield and gave up today there are no gatekeepers with respect to media any one can own their own online newspaper magazine radio station or tv station and distribute their content globally if you have a talent for what you do you also get to keep all of the revenues instead of working for someone else who determines the ceiling on what you can earn its a wonderful world we live in now despite the current economic trouble todays opportunities outstrip anything that could have been imagined before the internet

7953085 game theory is a universal language for the unification of the behavioral sciences
7953086 the analysis of such a highly simplified abstraction can very seldom lead to any specific recommendations in a specific situation but it can lead to insights of a general nature these insights can then be used by policy makers in making specific decisions or in formulating general policies
7953087 estimates place the us it outsourcing market at 160 billion in 2005 up from 101 billion in 2000

7953089 multi issue negotiation under time constraints in an incomplete information setting
7953090 the self interest orientation of each party can lead to actions that are individually rational yet produce a collectively suboptimal outcome
7953091 an individuals knowledge sharing tendency is driven by a set of contextualised concerns and interests not unlike the notion of payoff in game theory
7953092 the development of a systematic way to study individual coalitions the calculations of the costs of a network the calculations of the gross benefits for the whole network the distribution of the net benefits among the member of the network
7953093 members of the coalitions in the division have more to distribute among themselves than they would in any other division
7953094 any variation in the coalition structure will reduce total net benefits to coalition members
7953095 negotiation and cooperation among libraries is of special economic importance

7953236 it has always been the law that a man must have a belief because a man who affirms that he knows a thing affirms implicitly that he believes it and if he does not believe it that affirmation is false it is not the less false because the affirmation he makes is an affirmation about the state of his own mind a man may tell a lie about the state of his own mind just as much as he can tell a lie about the state of the weather or the state of his own digestion it makes to be sure the inquiry a difficult and complicated one and probably an obscure one as to what the state of his mind may have been but once arrive at the inference of fact that the state of mind was as to his own knowledge not that which he describes it as being then he has told a lie just as if he made an intentional misstatement of something outside his own mind and visible to the eyes of all men a great deal of the argument which has been addressed to the court arises as it seems to me under the fallacious use first of all of the principle that you cannot look into a mans mind the answer is that there is no such thing as an absolute criterion which gives you an index into a mans mind there is nothing outside his mind which is an absolute indication as to what is going on inside so far from saying that you cannot look into a mans mind you must look into it if you are going to find fraud against him and unless you think you see what must have been in his mind you cannot find him guilty of fraud

7953274 i think the key to minimizing the number who stay home is for obama to make clear that he really understands that the old time democrats the people who are supporting clinton working in the trenches doing their best for the country are as welcome to become activists and in their own way as his own following as his cult following is
7953275 quite honestly i feel strongly about electing a democratic president this year
7953276 so im going to do whatever is necessary to elect a democrat the next president of the united states
7953277 i think unity is important as we go forward but you cant feign unity
7953278 feigned unity isnt going to get us there we need to the real thing
7953279 for hillary to be on the ballot was a minimum first step of what i required
7953280 i am not ready to get on the phone and say lets all vote for obama
7953281 theres a far way to go still i believe we need to see the issues we hillary supporters are very very committed to certain issues that she promoted including health care
7953282 this to me is the first overture ive seen from the obama people to bring the hillary clinton supporters in
7953283 and i think theres been a bit of resentment thinking that they were taken for granted and i hope this is not a token gesture to appease
7953284 i would have just come out and addressed them and hit them right upside the head and that was never done
7953285 i do think you know its not just women there were a lot of male supporters of hillary clinton a lot we tend to forget that we tend to think its the wild fanatical fringe of older women but it really wasnt it crossed all age groups and sex groups as well
7953286 people get invested in their candidate and they feel passionate about it
7953287 well for my sake im drinking bottled water out of my troopers car were very careful about it
7953288 no it does not because we just draw a pretty clear line and its easy to stay on the side of the line tony
7953289 big party hosted by a lobbyist firm you walk in you eat you drink you get a gift and you walk out ok or not ok
7953290 well i dont really want to get into hypotheticals but probably not ok you know unless its finger food and its worth well if its a lobbyist and you know its a lobbyist then you probably shouldnt go
7953291 i just had a glass of water and visited with as many people as i could
7953292 any concerns about breaking any federal ethics rules by attending this
7953293 its clear that the rules are being followed and people are transparent above board and its the way it should be
7953294 i believe if i were an elected official i would be monitoring it myself
7953295 if i were a congressman or a senator i would be watching those things so they are not violated
7953296 our scheduling is going to be very challenging for us this season
7953297 i think we have some very tough non conference games including a hard road schedule and once again the acc is going to be one of the top conferences
7953298 i think the fans will love the opportunity to see our team in reynolds coliseum this season
7953299 our players have always loved playing in that atmosphere and im glad it will give the students the chance to just walk over from their dorms and be part of that environment
7953300 i cant wait to meet all the leaders and hear what they have to say
7953301 we get to be here and see it for ourselves
7953302 its something i never thought would happen but its something i will always remember being part of
7953303 thats what you really have to do you have to know more about every subject than they do
7953304 they focus less on power and control and much more on what leadership is being used for
7953305 to be an entrepreneur build my own business and hopefully own a fortune 500 company one day
7953306 i want to be able to take what ive learned here and just help other girls who may not know that its ok to take a stand and have your own voice
7953307 news views and a healthy degree of skepticism well be bringing you the latest from al jazeeras
7953308 almost everybody in mexico has a family member in america
7953309 i dont know why the city of golden would want al jazeera to come and broadcast from here what the network takes home with it would be totally different from what they see
7953310 its time to end the torture of prisoners at gitmo and abu ghraib
7953311 it would be nice if we could get people to disperse but theyre not committing a crime
7953312 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7953313 we must remain nonviolent we must have the high moral ground
7953314 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
7953315 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7953316 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7953317 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7953318 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7953319 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7953320 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7953321 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7953322 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7953323 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7953324 we have a very good working relationship and it is through that relationship that we have worked out a lot of the issues
7953325 i have done more in the last two months than people in my position historically have done and i am going to keep doing it
7953326 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7953327 are you strong enough to be my man or my president
7953328 what im hearing from sen obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy
7953329 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7953330 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7953331 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7953332 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7953333 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7953334 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7953335 well have no shortage of energy and enthusiasm in that stadium thursday night
7953336 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7953337 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7953338 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7953339 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7953340 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7953341 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news

7953365 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
7953366 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success
7953367 man are you sure itll be hard to get out of here
7953368 thats some bullshit im beating down the internet as we speak
7953369 i just dont accept thats a bad film its exactly the film i intended to make its supposed to be ironic and the most politically incorrect film of its period but the irony was lost by the enormity of her fame i suppose

7953397 the afghan council of ministers decided monday to review the presence of international forces and agreements with foreign allies including nato and the united states after a series of military operations that have caused mounting civilian losses the ministers demanded a status of forces agreement which would stipulate that the authority and responsibilities of international forces be negotiated and they said that aerial bombing illegal detentions and house raids by international forces must be stopped
7953398 the hostel building is a reminder that the things we treasure need not be that grand or that old
7953399 they merely have to be things we want to keep and pass on to future generations
7953400 reflect our history and can evoke special meaning individuals or members of a community
7953401 their real estate worth is incomparable with the treasure of memories they evoke and the place they occupy in our history
7953402 we think of our queensland history in bricks and stone but it can be just as imperishable when built of humble wood
7953403 my husband was telling someone in townsville about what we are doing to save the old building she says
7953404 apparently they did the same thing to the townsville yacht club kicked them out of their little humpy a few years ago put them into some flash place where they went broke within a year
7953405 then they had a caravan on the esplanade that they taught the kids how to sail out of for a few years and struggled for many years
7953406 consumer electronics remain a vital part of peoples everyday life and an increasing appetite for technology is especially encouraging as we head into the fourth quarter and the holiday shopping season
7953407 they believed like you and i believe that america should be a place where you can make it if you try
7953408 reminded us that we know what our world should look like he said we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be and isnt that the great american story
7953409 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7953410 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7953411 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7953412 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7953413 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7953414 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7953415 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7953416 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7953417 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
7953418 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
7953419 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
7953420 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
7953421 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7953422 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7953423 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7953424 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse
7953425 i have performed several reductions and have never had a case where i lost all the fetuses she needed to know that
7953426 there are just no rules or protocols for doctors to follow in this country
7953427 laws will be passed and they are not followed or implemented no one had any idea what to do when it came to ghazalas births it sort of all just happened
7953428 women can actually get pregnant with seven eight or nine babies
7953429 we need to tell people that it is safe and that it is ok religiously
7953430 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7953431 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7953432 hes just really into it with the family workshop he went to
7953433 she just got a taste of my new lifestyle we had spent a lot of time together before camp but it was never time like that being active and eating healthy
7953434 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
7953435 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy
7953436 i loved oreos and now i cant even look at that stuff
7953437 it would have been a lot harder i probably would have had a really hard time sticking to the diet and staying motivated
7953438 its really good to know that other people want you to succeed

7953458 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
7953459 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s
7953460 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology

7953470 i have asked authorities to evacuate all the affected of course air dropping of aid will continue so that those stranded get relief but everyone should be evacuated in four to five days so that in case of floods there will be less to worry about
7953471 all our savings are gone our losses have gone into the hundreds of thousands
7953472 just as torontonians rejected attempts by the south african regime to rebrand apartheid in the 1980s we will also refuse to buy into this latest attempt to change the subject and divert attention away from israels state sanctioned racism
7953473 the world increasingly rejects settler colonialism whether here on turtle island north america or in israel just as apartheid fell in south africa it will fall in turtle island and israel
7953474 we have our own tensions between the ethiopian and somali communities ever since the illegal us backed ethiopian occupation of somalia there are all kinds of amends to be made that will take a long time healing and relationship building for an external group of white people who know nothing about either of our communities to think they can appear from out of nowhere and build bridges between us is insulting it demonstrates an embarrassing level of cultural ignorance and incompetence if the israel rebranding campaign continues with this level of incompetence its failure is inevitable
7953475 brick by brick wall by wall israeli apartheid is going to fall
7953476 this is a bombshell because in one fell swoop it went down far more than we would have expected

7953529 we made the very difficult decision to permanently close the facility following a strategic review of the mills ability to be competitive both today and over the longer term
7953530 given a variety of factors including our business outlook the structural challenges of operating in this region and the condition of the mill at the time it was delivered to us by potlatch we simply cannot rationalize making the significant investment required to make the mill economically viable

7953539 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7953540 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
7953541 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7953542 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas

7953559 well thats a true statement that to play on the computer and to play games across the psn is free mmos being the exception to every case here are two other true statements you dont have to pay to watch television but people still subscribe to cable direct tv and now verizon fios you dont have to pay to listen to the radio but now people subscribe to satellite radio my point here is the psn and pcs online service is pretty much like free broadcast networks and free radio these are solid services but are currently not giving you that little something extra that money can buy

7953561 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
7953562 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7953563 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
7953564 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7953565 the world is losing the war i think at the moment the taliban definitely has the upper hand
7953566 this organisation is a terrorist organisation and has created mayhem against public life
7953567 the facts are pretty plain the deals across the border have led to a significant rise in insurgent activities here in afghanistan we know where these guys are being trained and armed to be sent to afghanistan to kill civilians and afghan and coalition troops this is obviously a political hot potato but we would be failing in our duty if we did not seek to counter this
7953568 i can only echo what president bush told the visiting pakistanis the other day that in effect information we share with them seems to end up with the bad guys
7953569 the us is now losing the war against the taliban pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has made it a major threat to us strategic interests

7953574 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
7953575 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
7953576 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
7953577 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high gasoline prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
7953578 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly
7953579 in the broad sense the earths climate is determined by solar radiation
7953580 there is now little doubt that solar wind variability streams of ionized gases that radiate out from the sun is the primary cause of climate change on a decadal time scale
7953581 we are not concerned about hundreds of thousands of years or millennia we are concerned about decades in the study because we are interested in what fits the human life span
7953582 it looks as if solar activity not solar radiation itself determines what happens with the climate
7953583 by disregarding or ignoring the very much larger changes of solar ultraviolet or of the solar wind and its magnetic field effect on cosmic rays and thus on cloud coverage the ipcc has managed to trivialize the climate effects of solar variability
7953584 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
7953585 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
7953586 although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades
7953587 whats controversial in my view is not the fact that solar activity affects the climate but the exact mechanism the details

7953595 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7953596 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up

7953600 i was scared for the museum on august 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself
7953601 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
7953602 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
7953603 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
7953604 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
7953605 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
7953606 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
7953607 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
7953608 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts

7953667 we all know that shia militias in baquba are a source of instability
7953668 influential shia members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent

7953680 the defendant used this occasion to terrorize an entire community
7953681 the victimization reached far and wide in this case he should pay dearly for that
7953682 while i dont want to minimize what happened this is not a situation where anyone was killed
7953683 none of these people are dead but its not through your kindness or change of heart
7953684 by doing this act you have robbed yourself and your family of what would be the best years of your life
7953685 hes very clear in this letter that his intent was to kill people
7953686 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7953709 the governor believes californians ought have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
7953710 the governor remains committed that he is not going to sign any bills until we have a budget
7953711 however these four measures need to get on the november ballot and he does not believe simply because the legislature has failed to do their job that californians should not have the opportunity to vote on these measures
7953712 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them

7953714 theres an incredible amount about larrabee thats undefined you cant just say its x86 so its going to solve the massively parallel computing problem
7953715 intel is not a stupid company theyve put a lot of people behind this so clearly they believe its viable but the products on our roadmap are competitive to this thing as theyve painted it the reality is going to fall short of the optimistic way theyve painted it
7953716 as peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7953717 what i actually described as equating to the performance of a 2006 vintage graphics chip was a performance standard defined by intel itself running the game f e a r at 60 fps in 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution with four sample antialiasing
7953718 roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7953719 we underestimated ati with respect to their product weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7953720 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
7953721 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7953722 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7953723 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7953724 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7953725 bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
7953726 this is a way to help georgia make their web pages visible to the world

7953728 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
7953729 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7953730 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7953731 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
7953732 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
7953733 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
7953734 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
7953735 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
7953736 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7953737 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7953738 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7953739 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7953740 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7953741 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7953742 now that the technology is here we hope to finally do it the way that people who really care about music have always wanted to see it done
7953743 we continue to believe that the market has not yet valued either tivos long term prospects for stand alone growth or the potential value from its licensing partners
7953744 ah yes thats imovie telling you your hard drive is full time to move some of the 35 000 pictures of the grandkids to your backup drive

7953746 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7953747 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7953748 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7953749 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7953750 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7953751 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7953752 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7953753 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7953754 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7953755 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7953756 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7953757 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7953758 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7953759 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7953760 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7953761 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7953762 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7953763 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7953764 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7953765 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7953766 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7953767 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7953768 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7953769 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7953770 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7953771 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7953772 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7953773 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7953774 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7953775 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7953776 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7953777 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7953778 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7953779 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7953780 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7953781 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7953782 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7953783 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7953784 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7953785 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7953786 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7953787 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7953788 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7953789 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7953790 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7953791 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7953792 while press reports have made clear that freddie is having little success raising private capital it does not seem to be having any difficulty attracting investors in
7953793 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7953794 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7953795 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7953796 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7953797 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7953798 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7953799 what if techs sphinx outfit was more blue beetle than batman beyond
7953800 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7953801 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7953802 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7953803 some days as i work on this book i hear voices from within that tell me this work is not real activism political though it may be
7953804 its as if the process of poetry itself temporarily releases me into the realm of human power which marx said is its own end
7953805 emotionally heartbreaking im telling you this for a reason because i dont want you guys to think youre going to go through this without getting yourself really twisted its brutal what happens to us not many of us make it
7953806 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7953807 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7953808 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7953809 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7953810 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7953811 we have been very fortunate to secure some of the nations most distinguished and successful executives to discuss critical business issues facing us in the future
7953812 we believe these panelists will offer unique perspectives on rapid shifts in the world economy and world environment and the new demands for leadership
7953813 under the current law mr ferguson will have to serve at least 30 years of the life sentence before he will be eligible to receive parole
7953814 however that does not necessarily mean that mr ferguson will receive parole once he becomes eligible
7953815 there are really an infinite number of improvements we can make at the water treatment plant
7953816 something has got to be done and this is the first step
7953817 i stood up here last year and said i was confident we would have tax reform
7953818 well it didnt happen but well go back and try again it may take a few years but as long as were moving in the right direction im confident
7953819 i will do everything in my power to fight against any efforts to eliminate the exemption to take it off the table
7953820 we dont need to add on a tax right now to people who are barely making it that 250 or 300 may be someones rent or house payment
7953821 it took me three years to get that to a vote
7953822 this makes it a little easier to dispose of this property
7953823 english should be the official language of our state and our country
7953824 if someone moves into our country they need to learn english if they cant even read the road signs while driving because they dont know english they need to go back to their own country
7953825 a triumphant appearance that evoked 50 years of party history
7953826 i found her speech one of the most impressive and moving campaign speeches about a candidate ive ever heard
7953827 the center of a multimedia charm offensive that may be the most closely managed spousal rollout in presidential campaign history
7953828 owned by the sapling foundation a private nonprofit foundation that was established in 1996 by chris anderson who was at that time a magazine publishing entrepreneur
7953829 the time of our lives we practice the i dos and the party part too
7953830 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7953831 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7953832 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7953833 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7953834 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7953835 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7953836 jeder wei dass ich den riddick charakter liebe und ich arbeite st ndig daran es dauert nur f nf jahre noch einen zu machen da es david twohy und mir so kostbar ist
7953837 lc is mad at audrina because audrina was mad at lo for making her hang out less with her after lc was mad at heidi so she spent more time with audrina after she moved in but then spent less time with audrina after lo moved it because audrina and lo dont get along well and now audrina is talking to heidi because shes mad at lc even though she doesnt like spencer who doesnt like lc even though lc is friends with spencers sister making spencer and heidi mad at spencers sister for being friends with lc even if spencers sister used to not like lc because lc didnt like spencer and spencer is mad at brody because brody is friends with lc but lc is still mad that brody wont settle down with her and because brody hooked up with jen bunny thus making lc mad at jen bunny so jen bunny be friended heidi but then didnt like heidi because she told lies about lc
7953838 his name is doon dong but you can call him mark

7953848 this study is important because it shows that many people looking for their dream home have had much of their time wasted on having to search through screen after screen of bad data it really is a case of buyer beware
7953849 we were careful to tease apart the data to be sure we were making an apples to apples comparison of the listings in these markets
7953850 the data here clearly show as they did in a national study we conducted earlier this year that a site based on information from a local mls will give consumers a more accurate picture of whats available in a local market
7953851 the correction in the los angeles multifamily investment property market seems to have hit hard with median sale price and median price per square foot down 30 4 and 22 1 respectively over the same quarter last year
7953852 the tightened conditions for a commercial loan revealed their adverse effects on larger investments in the bronx manifesting in a 55 drop in five or more family building sales compared to the second quarter of 2007 stated radu farcas of the comparables product team at propertyshark com

7953857 it revolves around money and the money revolves around drugs so what were dealing with here in a business arrangement a business deal that went bad and as a result of that this is a murder for hire
7953858 if you are a person who is involved in an illegal criminal enterprise particularly affiliated with these people then you might consider yourself in danger i think that is what has occurred that these people who knew about this before we did knew they were in danger and some of them fled

7953860 henry was the obvious choice to manage our growth through this critical phase
7953861 he brings a wealth of experience and complementary strengths to austhink notably his proven expertise in business development and the ability to execute in highly competitive environments this is a terrific opportunity for our company with henry taking operational control i will be freed to work on core issues such as product direction key messaging content development and strategic alliances
7953862 im excited to take on a new role here at austhink and to build on the companys impressive growth and stature
7953863 we have an opportunity to make a notable impact on a number of industries and i look forward to leading the charge to take austhink to the next level
7953864 in the first half of 2008 the refiners went from exhilaration to desperation
7953865 the growth of global fuel demands over the next two decades will give little comfort to refiners facing the destruction of their profit margins
7953866 was defined as a percentage of listings on a site that matched the mls
7953867 this study is important because it shows that many people looking for their dream home have had much of their time wasted on having to search through screen after screen of bad data it really is a case of buyer beware
7953868 we were careful to tease apart the data to be sure we were making an apples to apples comparison of the listings in these markets

7953870 our primary investment goal for 2008 is to increase capacity in sales support research development client services and management talent and the growing demand for world check illustrated by a 20 client growth since january is testament to these investments this growth momentum and our ability to sustain high quality performance and continued client satisfaction confirms that we are on the right path furthermore our impeccable 98 client renewal rate is an acknowledgment of our ability to consistently identify risk ahead of the curve thus assisting clients in mitigating reputational financial and regulatory risk
7953871 there are many things that make world check unique amongst them of course are the depth relevance and cleanliness of our data but perhaps the most important are the passion and the dedication that every one at world check shares for providing the best service possible to our thousands of users
7953872 world check is a must have in compliance and risk departments across a wide range of sectors and we are very much aware that our customers rely on us to perform their duties effectively our renewal rate simply reflects the fact that we at world check have not for one moment forgotten this responsibility we are honoured to be trusted by so many institutions and we remain as committed as always to delivering best of breed intelligence

7953875 the lx3 is the ideal model for both amateur photographers who want to start shooting at a higher level and professionals alike its full set of functions draws a distinct line between the lx3 and ordinary compact cameras it stands alone as a compact camera whose image creating capabilities rival even digital slrs

7953878 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7953879 the expectations index is very sensitive to movements in gas prices so this rebound almost certainly is a reflection of the drop in prices over the past few weeks
7953880 the august rise is welcome but it is trivial compared to the plunge over the past year
7953881 putting the rebound in context at 56 9 the headline index is still a lot closer to the low of 51 0 reached in june than it is to the reading of 87 3 that the index started this year at
7953882 it appears that the housing meltdown and the weakness in the labour market are still weighing heavily on consumers
7953883 over the past couple of years that gap has proved to be a good leading indicator of the unemployment rate
7953884 households are finding jobs the hardest to get since october 2003 which suggests further increases in unemployment in the months ahead
7953885 nonetheless consumer fundamentals remain fragile with energy prices failing to fall any further in august unemployment rising while real wage growth remains negative
7953886 months supply doesnt tell you anything when the sales pace is low
7953887 w e still cant say with any confidence that sales have hit bottom though the rate of decline has certainly slowed
7953888 i think you can tell whether a man gets it or not if the women around him are strong
7953889 which i think is the only gubernatorial condominium in the united states today
7953890 this election is about big differences that make a big difference in the quality of our lives
7953891 and that is why we have got to go out and fight for it and win it
7953892 just so we distinguish it from washington dc i will repeat it is the great state of washington

7953922 knowing they will have a first lady who understands their challenges
7953923 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7953924 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7953925 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7953926 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7953927 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7953928 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard
7953929 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7953930 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm

7953932 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7953933 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7953934 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7953935 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7953936 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7953937 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7953938 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7953939 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7953940 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7953941 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7953942 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7953943 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7953944 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7953945 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7953946 i remember being at the tokyo motor show in the mid 1990s and talking about the environment
7953947 even when the large s u v s and trucks were big sellers they did not fit with our philosophy
7953948 i would particularly also want to call out thanks to senator kerry for coming to bali i would note that the remarks he gave in bali were very constructive in helping to educate the international community on the needs what it would take for america to move forward together in a bi partisan way i thought those remarks were very well received senator kerry thank you for that
7953949 the fact that we had a treaty was significantly due to the fact that senator kerry was there he was a virtual part of our negotiating team without his day and night support and lobbying of the eu we would not have gotten a treaty
7953950 why dont you talk about the issues instead of someones personal appearance
7953951 when all the facts and positions are lined up and tallied its only logical to vote for kerry
7953952 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7953953 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7953954 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7953955 because mgs4 was optimized for the ps3 it is probably not possible on xbox 360
7953956 if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know my future games wont be based on the hardware anymore
7953957 probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
7953958 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware
7953959 i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7953960 a plane has been hijacked and is thought to be in libya
7953961 there are some people who dont seem to understand that we really need to move on
7953962 their feelings are hurt and they just dont seem to see the bigger picture
7953963 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7953964 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7953965 we are after all democrats so it may take awhile
7953966 we are not the fall in line party but make no mistake we are united
7953967 she said she would do everything in her power to protect the california coast from offshore oil development
7953968 they want us to do it develop alternative energy really quickly
7953969 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7953970 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7953971 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7953972 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7953973 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7953974 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7953975 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7953976 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7953977 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7953978 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

7953987 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7953988 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7953989 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7953990 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7953991 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7953992 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7953993 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7953994 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7953995 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7953996 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7953997 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7953998 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7953999 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him

7954002 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
7954003 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
7954004 that deputy saved about three or four other deputies from getting hurt or killed
7954005 i think its a lot different to be a reality show in a reality show theres a beginning and a middle and an end and something happens but my life is so sporadic and so crazy none of its contrived none of its made up
7954006 today clean energy is at the center of our attention new technologies and improvements in existing technologies are key to addressing our energy needs and climate change
7954007 horizon is proud to do business in the great state of kansas and applauds the efforts taking place at cloud county community college to educate and train the next generation of wind technicians the school currently has 50 students enrolled and is beginning a web based program horizon has hired some of these students as interns and full time employees at our meridian way wind farm and is very pleased with the results
7954008 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7954009 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7954010 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7954011 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7954012 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7954013 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7954014 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7954015 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7954016 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7954017 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7954018 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7954019 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7954020 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7954021 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7954022 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7954023 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7954024 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7954025 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7954026 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7954027 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7954028 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7954029 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7954030 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7954031 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7954032 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7954033 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7954034 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7954035 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7954036 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7954037 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7954038 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7954039 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7954040 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7954041 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7954042 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7954043 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7954044 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7954045 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7954046 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7954047 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7954048 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7954049 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7954050 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7954051 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7954052 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7954053 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

7954057 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7954058 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7954059 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7954060 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7954061 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7954062 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7954063 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7954064 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7954065 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7954066 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7954067 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7954068 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7954069 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7954070 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7954071 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7954072 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7954073 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7954074 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7954075 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7954076 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7954077 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7954078 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7954079 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7954080 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7954081 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7954082 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7954083 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7954084 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7954085 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7954086 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7954087 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7954088 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7954089 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7954090 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7954091 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7954092 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7954093 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7954094 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7954095 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7954096 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7954097 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7954098 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7954099 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7954100 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7954101 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7954102 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7954103 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7954104 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7954105 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7954106 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7954107 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7954108 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7954109 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7954110 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7954111 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7954112 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7954113 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7954114 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7954115 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7954116 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7954117 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7954118 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7954119 a city is like a capricious woman she takes time to be seduced and to reveal herself completely
7954120 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7954121 i try to post at least one update per day because i believe that there should be at least one thing we want to tell our consumers per day
7954122 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7954123 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7954124 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7954125 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7954126 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7954127 this whole thing about the nomination roll call for clinton to introduce that kind of uncertainty is just what you dont want
7954128 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7954129 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7954130 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7954131 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7954132 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7954133 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7954134 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7954135 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
7954136 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
7954137 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
7954138 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
7954139 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
7954140 i had a really sick feeling to my stomach when i heard about these things that went on
7954141 i knew that my conscience couldnt allow me to go over there to iraq
7954142 i have a son i wouldnt be able to see its kind of hard to think about that
7954143 we would hope that the canadian government allow the men and women who refuse to fight a war that canadians also refuse to fight to stay up there especially after seeing the heavy punishment that robin long faces
7954144 veterans and war resisters are beginning to see that they are in the same boat that they are brothers and sisters and it is one struggle
7954145 the fact that people are showing this kind of solidarity with each other is really profound resistance within the military is certainly growing
7954146 if youre out there sing along with me stand up and say it loud tomorrows starting now
7954147 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7954148 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7954149 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7954150 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7954151 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7954152 significantimpact on the number of natural gas vehicles in the u s
7954153 clean energy would be a significant beneficiary if thiswere to pass
7954154 when the last tree is cut the last river poisoned and the last fish dead
7954155 if there was some other news to cover we wouldnt talk about disunity in the democratic party
7954156 the numbers tell a different story from the hype and theatre around the convention
7954157 for me god is something we cant understand because im sure that i have something i cant possibly understand therefore i believe in god
7954158 i was wondering if maybe solar cells could be made with carbon nanotubes
7954159 i mean carbon is cheap and ive seen self assembling molecules so i think it would be easy to make
7954160 we said al gores just a spokesman for these ideas wouldnt you like to meet with the people doing the real work
7954161 todays visit to the lab is only one of seven visits david will be making to companies doing work in this area
7954162 weve had kids who wanted to swim with the dolphins or paint their room in a tom and jerry theme but davids wish is really unique
7954163 a friend and i are trying to build a hydrocraft using ions
7954164 but we havent been able to get the aluminum foil and balsa wood into the air yet
7954165 grow algae and use carbon dioxide to make oxygen and it could feed on the astronauts waste
7954166 another problem well have with sending an astronaut to mars is their exposure to radiation thats something else you might think about
7954167 these are really excellent ideas and we want to do everything we can to encourage his inventiveness after all this is where the wild new things come from
7954168 how do i know when to use which sun virtualization technology and how do i know if i can virtualize my application
7954169 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7954170 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7954171 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7954172 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7954173 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7954174 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7954175 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7954176 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7954177 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7954178 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7954179 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7954180 the australian funding was provided to the hellenic red cross special emergency fund for victims of fire for the general purpose of helping with the relief effort
7954181 immediately after the fires the municipality asked us to use this money for construction of a town hall because it was the request of all the local representatives
7954182 i remember when i went to zaharo i was received warmly and made an honorary citizen
7954183 i was asked to do this and it is something i agreed to do
7954184 when we found out from the australian government something was not ok with the permits it was too late and the project had started
7954185 however i requested on 20 june 2008 from the municipality of zaharo that all work should be stopped on this project until the situation was cleared up
7954186 i declare categorically that the intent of the greek red cross was and is relief for the fire victims and if someone has acted illegally in this particular instance we reserve every legal right
7954187 we demand to know where the money has gone and nobody is telling us
7954188 will this directory server be used for users and groups
7954189 the numbers started out pretty good just over 1 5 million tuned in for the premiere episode
7954190 the fed continued to voice concern on the outlook forinflation and so that suggests that the fed could eventuallylift u s interest rates in coming months which would be dollarsupportive but equal concerns on downside risks to growth andupside risks to inflation are keeping dollar activityrestrained in the aftermath of the minutes
7954191 mexicos growth will slow as well although not as much asin the united states
7954192 women artists such as georgia okeefe painted realistic images of fruit and flowers buffie johnsons pomegranate paintings reflect the striking natural symbols similar to the uterus and richness of the female fedundity
7954193 following the fall we have seen in stocks in 2008 andsimultaneous strong performance in earnings industryregulators had a meeting with leading brokers to devise a wayout of this
7954194 since companies are becoming so much more comfortableabout their future prospects and valuations a logical solutionwas to allow them to buy back shares
7954195 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7954196 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7954197 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7954198 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7954199 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7954200 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7954201 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7954202 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
7954203 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
7954204 there are increasing indications it will not be possibleto have a fruitful session of parliament because of the impassebetween ourselves and the opposition on a number of files particularly on key economic issues
7954205 the country must have a government that can functionduring a time of economic uncertainty and if its not thisgovernment or this parliament the public will have anopportunity to decide whom
7954206 in addition members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions
7954207 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
7954208 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7954209 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7954210 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7954211 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7954212 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7954213 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7954214 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7954215 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7954216 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
7954217 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7954218 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
7954219 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
7954220 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
7954221 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7954222 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7954223 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7954224 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7954225 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7954226 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7954227 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7954228 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7954229 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7954230 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7954231 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7954232 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7954233 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7954234 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7954235 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7954236 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7954237 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7954238 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7954239 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7954240 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7954241 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7954242 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
7954243 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
7954244 is offering us the kind of vision and sense of urgency that has been so lacking in the presidential campaigns
7954245 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climat
7954246 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
7954247 i can remember only one specific time and i think it was right after he got back from vietnam in 1971 once he was into life back in the states i just never saw him involved in anything like that
7954248 another close friend from gores nashville period who declined to be named
7954249 but rather the measure of a man who would browbeat a friend into covering up
7954250 an important figure in gores countercultural life during the nashville years
7954251 seems to have selective memory that puts him in the center of all the action
7954252 whether warnecke played the mephistophelean role that he claims for himself remains uncertain and debatable
7954253 old it may be but if gore is willing to fudge on this what else is he trying to hide
7954254 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7954255 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7954256 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7954257 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7954258 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7954259 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7954260 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7954261 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7954262 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7954263 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7954264 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7954265 vamos a seguir dando seguimiento a la evoluci n de gustav y a sus efectos
7954266 i dont have an attitude problem youre just an asshole
7954267 i have an ongoing concern that human sexuality is a euphemism for focusing on male homosexuality without discussing sexuality issues that affect the reality of womens lives for instance the sex trafficking of women and girls female genital mutilation the taking of child brides and the terrible problems for girls who bear children
7954268 i think hes serious it seems to be serious to me
7954269 i am here this morning because this is the most interesting state delegation there is and i want to find out how it is moving
7954270 this is the most important state ive talked to people at the top of the republican campaign and they have a check list new hampshire michigan and then pennsylvania that is the plan if they get pennsylvania they win thats what they think
7954271 democrats have to hold this state it is all about this state
7954272 you know what i do for a living i have this job

7954276 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7954277 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
7954278 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success
7954279 the mayors going to give another speech later at city hall we can tear that speech up when we get there
7954280 we can tear the next pd agenda up when we get to it
7954281 its a larger opportunity to say what shes been saying for the last couple of months and its obviously a bigger stage
7954282 most developers struggle with the nuances of making a database dance well to their directions
7954283 indeed a sql maestro is required to perform interesting queries for data transformations during etl processing or extract load transform processing or data mining during analytics
7954284 trivially parallelizable framework so that even novice developers a k a interns could write programs in a variety of languages java c c perl python to analyze data independent of scale
7954285 on its own mapreduce can do a lot of important work in data manipulation and analysis integrating it with sql should just increase its applicability and power
7954286 i think everyone now has an even better understanding of the issues

7954302 in london youre lucky if you get one rozzer its something else on show night there will be 20 levels of staff before you get through to see the missus
7954303 her legs are olympic standard she is in amazing shape you wont find a fitter bird than her her legs are so toned shes fitter than dancers on her tour who are half her age
7954304 britney in the lift is based on real footage the missus saw of someone stuck in a lift for 48 hours the dancing is inspired by what happened inside
7954305 she nicked my old guitar teacher off me his names monte
7954306 he was in a heavy metal band now shes nicked him for the show he teaches her too
7954307 you get in shes on and then you have two hours of non stop entertainment
7954308 i havent seen a lot of the shows properly before because i always forget my glasses
7954309 i tried not to talk politics with my parents and cleaned my kitchen

7954324 commercial interiors became a part of our business by accident
7954325 clients kept asking us to create interiors for them after a few dozen projects including one at ross bridge resort that won the national sales and marketing councils top award over 1 400 other entries we realized we were on to something
7954326 you can watch your father die but not your child die
7954327 is hypertension in this age group a problem in india if yes what is the incidence and prevalence if it is not a major problem why conduct a trial in india and put children at risk without any benefit
7954328 comprehensive revision of schedule y that prescribes requirements of clinical trials has been undertaken in order to harness the countrys potential to participate in global multi centric clinical trials
7954329 the aiims is a renowned research institution the children must have died because they were already very ill
7954330 we can have a broad discussion on the subject in the country but at the same time i would say that india has become the hub of a lot of research activities which is the need of the hour
7954331 a huge population with a diversity of diseases that are untreated yes that is the india advantage identified by igate clinical research international commenting that india represents a largely untapped resource for clinical trials
7954332 40 million asthmatic patients about 34 million diabetic patients eight to ten million people hiv positive eight million epileptic patients three million cancer patients
7954333 medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research
7954334 consumer electronics remain a vital part of peoples everyday life and an increasing appetite for technology is especially encouraging as we head into the fourth quarter and the holiday shopping season
7954335 to those of you who supported me i would be forever grateful for you to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me
7954336 the clinton supporters i talk to will vote for obama but they may not go out and work for him
7954337 weve got a job here to do and our job is to vote for hillary every time her name comes up
7954338 i want to protest the election system the democrats ran and the only way i know is my vote
7954339 they give in and then of course they subvert the process immediately afterward
7954340 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7954341 ive seen those ads and heres what i have to say im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7954342 i think it was really important for her to say she supported obama especially in the hispanic community
7954343 we want them to know were here were serious and we have millions of voters behind us
7954344 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7954345 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
7954346 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7954347 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7954348 i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7954349 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7954350 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7954351 today we have structure government parliament legal authorities and our national institutions have reached strength our police and army are growing
7954352 the requirement of time as well as painful incidents of civilian casualties compelled the afghan government to demand talks on regulating the presence of international forces in afghanistan
7954353 we put the bodies in the main mosque he told the associated press by phone sometimes pausing to collect himself as he wept
7954354 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7954355 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7954356 what have you been up to the past four years
7954357 ive been shooting a very popular reality show about my life for mtv actually see those cameras were on it right now
7954358 becoming angry or anxious for no clear reason except for maybe something that happened two years ago that wasnt a big deal anyway
7954359 recent series of attacks confirms a renewed upsurge in violence but also even above all the
7954360 when i arrived in september 2005 we found a number of issues within the trust and a serious financial situation we had to save 10 million in that first year
7954361 staffing levels got worse because of that deficit two thirds of the staffing reductions were in non clinical areas but a third were from the clinical side
7954362 we went through 18 months of hell but we had to do that in order to consolidate our position if we had not done that there would have been doubts about cannock hospital and the future of the whole trust
7954363 to those people and families who have experienced poor care again i apologise but i still believe that we had to sort the organisation out the alternative is that they wouldnt have the trust now
7954364 i do believe we are in a better position now and the patients and public will start to see this
7954365 theres no corner been turned hes apologised because hes had to apologise because hes feeling the pinch now not only from us but from people in the community like doctors the nurses are demoralised because they are reading in the papers that these improvements are being made but nothing has changed
7954366 i define drive as self motivation people who will walk right through brick walls on their own power without having to be asked to achieve whatever goal is in front of them people with drive push and push and push and push and push until they succeed drive is independent of educational experience grade point averages and socioeconomic background
7954367 well you probably want to talk about my technology sales experience
7954368 no i want to talk about how you got a movie made in three years
7954369 finally beware in particular people who have been at highly successful companies people used to say back when ibm owned the industry never hire someone straight out of ibm first let them go somewhere else and fail then once theyve realized the real world is not like ibm hire them and theyll be great
7954370 anyone who loves what they do is inherently intensely curious about their field their profession their craft they read about it study it talk to other people about it immerse themselves in it continuously and you should be hiring people who love what they do
7954371 i dont know that answer now but i guarantee you that i will by 9pm tonight
7954372 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7954373 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7954374 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7954375 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7954376 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7954377 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7954378 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7954379 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7954380 a plane has been hijacked and is thought to be in libya
7954381 my daughter did not know she was pregnant she has had several miscarriages one of which nearly killed her
7954382 if she knew she was pregnant she would have told everybody she and her husband wanted that so bad they would have been happy they would have gotten medical attention she did not know she was pregnant
7954383 they need to be concentrating on what they learn not how they are dressing
7954384 we want to make sure that any time you see those train tracks you think of the possibility that a train could be coming
7954385 they cant get out of the way they cant stop on a dime so you just have to be really careful around them
7954386 a chapel hill middle school could become the first in the country to give an ipod to every teacher and student an experiment that would challenge teachers and administrators to ensure the hand held devices are used as learning tools not toys
7954387 its still not clear how the ipod touches would be used at culbreth middle school and school officials know that students may use the ipod touches more to download the new jonas brothers single than to tap the riches of human knowledge but principal susan wells says that to dismiss the technology as a distraction or a gimmick ignores todays tech driven world
7954388 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting she said
7954389 if the project wins funding culbreths teachers administrators and students during the next year will develop courses for which ipod touches are central to the curriculum other schools could follow culbreths model
7954390 culbreth has bought 35 ipods 15 for teachers and administrators and 20 for students in advancement via individual determination a program for college bound students who need extra help
7954391 if private funding can be obtained to foot the 230 000 bill every student and teacher will have an ipod touch by winter break
7954392 suspension means that there are no specific plans to publish future issues
7954393 the premier issue will be sent to all current windows mobile subscribers

7954395 where have you worked or if you were a student what schools did you attend during the last five years include military service
7954396 where have you worked or if you were a student what schools did you attend during the last five years include military service begin with your current or latest employer and then list every place you have worked or studied for the last five years if you need more space use a separate sheet of paper
7954397 despite the best efforts of the government and humanitarian community to respond to the crisis the needs of people continue to far outstrip the resources available to hand
7954398 the time when the land is full of new shoots but there is no food it happens because the last rains failed and few crops were planted
7954399 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
7954400 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
7954401 i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it
7954402 ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7954403 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that

7954405 the more work he does with our guys in the group the better
7954406 its the last preseason game and you want to go out and have a good showing but you want to do that whether its the first preseason game or the last
7954407 obviously you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouths but also for your teammates and coaches as well
7954408 if you look at it historically his backups havent gotten a lot of time
7954409 its a testament to how tough he is both mentally and physically if things go well im not going to see the field too much more after thursday night
7954410 i said earlier my experience may help a little and that definitely may have been the difference on one or two points in the match
7954411 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7954412 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits

7954430 why did the fed wait for so long before actually cutting interest rates instead of a savage 325 basis point cut that included emergency action over closed door weekends why did the fed not follow their previous policy of instigating sooner runs of 25 basis point moves each month
7954431 a set of smaller earlier controlled cuts would have created an environment where the interbank may have actually trusted the fact that things were stable enough to lend and therefore the balance sheets deficits may have been able to have been traded towards some kind of respectable loss instead of being frozen in that case the cuts may have actually found their way towards the consumer as well if the consumer actually was the intended target that is we would still have achieved the same goal of 2 00 rates eventually but may have done it without seeing commodities and therefore inflation explode

7954453 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
7954454 the 2007 levels already disappointing because they are worse than those for the 2001 recession are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years this suggests that significant pain may lie ahead for many americans
7954455 the numbers of uninsured parents and children are likely to grow as employers lay off more workers and states consider cuts in their medicaid programs to help balance their budgets during the economic slowdown

7954457 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
7954458 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
7954459 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rates in children and for the fall in uninsured rates in the general population
7954460 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million
7954461 you just see the difference the new massachusetts health reform plan has made in improving coverage
7954462 45 7 million people who are uninsured is still a major problem there is no cause for celebration that we only have 45 7 million uninsured there is still a very serious problem the most serious problem we have in the health sector

7954654 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
7954655 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7954656 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7954657 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7954658 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7954659 bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come

7954725 this has caused in some quarters a huge animosity towards muslims as a whole
7954726 that is tremendously unfair because those fanatics responsible represent a very tiny fraction of the whole and the vast majority of muslims are peace loving family orientated hard working and just want to get on with their lives as you do its important if you are to do justice in this case to put immediately to one side any bias any prejudice that you may feel
7954727 bear in mind whatever mr rizvi may have announced in the mosque based upon his understanding of the law in this country mr rizvi is not a lawyer is not a judge its not the law of this country that the use of a zanjeer by somebody under 16 is illegal you have to judge each individual situation on its own merits

7954738 the shifting faith vote what it means for the election
7954739 the push for the democratic party is to have a new position on abortion
7954740 when you look at catholics and evangelicals you see that they agree with 80 percent of what mr obama says but theres this stumbling block with abortion
7954741 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters

7954753 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
7954754 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
7954755 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
7954756 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
7954757 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
7954758 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
7954759 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
7954760 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address

7954764 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7954765 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7954766 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7954767 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7954768 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

7954785 the ageing crisis in australia is a far greater crisis than climate change
7954786 if action isnt taken now to plan for the financial crisis thats going to occur by the year 2030 the ageing population of australia will bankrupt the federal budget
7954787 by that time there will be more voters in australia over the age of 50 than under the age of 50 and that situation will worsen through the rest of the century
7954788 we believe that can be turned into an advantage if governments plan for it now
7954789 if they create the right conditions for pensioners in areas such as superannuation health and housing

7954794 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
7954795 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal consequences neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
7954796 russia has made an extraordinary strategic mistake and has badly damaged its place in modern international relations
7954797 i have appealed to all leaders concerned to speed up georgias nato and eu integration we already have some positive signals from our north atlantic and european partners
7954798 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7954799 russia opposes the whole world and has chosen a path of isolation we will soon see how damaging this decision will be for russias economy

7954815 our demonstration of the environmental sensitivity of alpine lake ecosystems highlights both their vulnerability and usefulness as indicators of the effects of global warming and the predicted increases in climatic variability
7954816 the climate regime in the 2000s altered the character and the function of high elevation aquatic ecosystem
7954817 forecasts of increased temperature and climatic variability in the future pose serious ramifications for both the biodiversity and ecosystem function of high elevation lakes
7954818 the impacts of future change in climate on alpine ecosystems are particularly worrisome given that variation in climate is expected to be most pronounced at high elevations around the world

7954832 well ive always wanted to be a writer when i was just a small girl i wrote poetry and short stories although i never stopped writing at some point in my thirties i decided that id better stop procrastinating about writing commercially accessible work if i wanted to be published this realization partly came out of a series of workshops by steven barnes another niven collaborator so i went back to school at our local community college and started attending writing workshops and classes given by published writers with real track records after that it only took a couple of years to start publishing and of course knowing mr niven and writing with him helped steven also helped me out with good advice science fiction writers are generally a really supportive community and we have a tradition of helping newcomers

7954881 marokko heeft gaten geslagen in mijn voorheen immer vrolijk gemoed sinds mijn terugkomst schuw ik mensen en zonlicht ik ben gedesori nteerd als een kat die in het rond is gedraaid en zijn gevoel voor evenwicht compleet is verloren dramatisch dan vraag ik je hoe zou jij er aan toe zijn als je twee weken lang door een land trok waar de omgangsvormen ruw zijn waar het klimaat verstikkend is waar je dagelijks met jaloezie wordt geconfronteerd simpelweg omdat je het geluk hebt in europa te wonen waar prostitutie stuitende vormen heeft aangenomen en waar corruptie nog altijd welig tiert waar ambtenaren politie douaniers je met minachting behandelen als je geen woord arabisch spreekt hoe zou je je voelen als je daar twee weken lang aan werd blootgesteld nou dus
7954882 als ik straks terug ben in europa kus ik de grond ik zit er echt even doorheen
7954883 je weet dat het gebeurt en weet je wat ik dan doe dan zeg ik dat ik weet dat hij te veel rekent en geef ik nog een paar dirham extra
7954884 we zaten in een taxi zegt die chauffeur zie je die meisjes in bikini op het strand ze zien er zo goedkoop uit alsof ze voor 15 dirham 1 20 euro met je meegaan ze komen zeker uit nederland daarmee wilde hij zeggen het zouden jullie zussen kunnen zijn
7954885 je voelt soms de jaloezie ze denken waar betalen die jongens in vredesnaam die autos van soms laten ze je het ook voelen dan snijden ze autos met europese kentekens extra af ik begrijp hun gevoel ook wel maar wat doe je eraan
7954886 want als er n wet in marokko dubbelzinnig is dan is het de wet op alcoholgebruik een moslim mag alcohol verkopen maar niet aan andere moslims verder mag iedereen zelf weten wat hij thuis doet maar op straat kun je worden opgepakt voor openbare dronkenschap aan wie verkoopt men dan de miljoenen hectoliters bier en wijn geproduceerd door marokkaanse ondernemingen als sincomar en brasseries du maroc om maar niet te spreken van alle alcohol die wordt ingevoerd om te voldoen aan de lokale vraag vroeg het marokkaanse tijdschrift la vie eco zich eerder al af zeker aan de christenen schreef collegablad le journal cynisch
7954887 ze begrijpen de nederlandse context niet ze hebben het over cultuur taal en religie ze spreken ons aan als onderdanen van de marokkaanse koning en niet als zelfstandig denkende en handelende burgers de politieke cultuur in marokko zal moeten veranderen en daar is veel lef voor nodig

7954892 there are three factors all happening at once the structural the cyclical and the structural multiplied by the cyclical

7954895 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session

7954900 the past few years have been about show more than substance
7954901 these things became more evident as a result of her support for clinton
7954902 a cest mon ptit c t exhibitonniste jai pass huit ans et demi en allemagne et il faut savoir que l bas les saunas sont mixtes et tout le monde est nu donc cest cause de a
7954903 on a enfin compris pourquoi bixente lizarazu avait fait toute sa carri re au bayer munich a cest une information
7954904 none of the data today is suggestive of a dollar correction down were likely to get more proof that the u s remains firm while other countries are deteriorating
7954905 the overriding trend is still dollar strength pullbacks in the dollar are still short and shallow
7954906 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7954907 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7954908 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7954909 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7954910 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7954911 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7954912 it makes bhps bid look better it was looking fine before but it looks even better now
7954913 its going to be hard for rio to make a concerted push from here to argue that they are undervalued
7954914 and the divisions that did the best relatively speaking were iron ore and coal particularly in australia where they have a good affinity with bhps assets
7954915 crear una conexi n territorial entre los bloques de asentamientos y asentamientos aislados que se encuentran en el coraz n de cisjordania
7954916 se ha multiplicado por 1 8 en los meses de enero a mayo de 2008 en comparaci n con los datos del a o pasado
7954917 los asentamientos sirven de excusa a los violentos para actuar contra la ocupaci n
7954918 this is not just a reaction to todays market conditions its a reaction to the realisation that we have to be a lean and more agile and fundamentally different company if were going to succeed in the modern media world
7954919 we do believe for a range of structural and other reasons that we can be more productive and it will have absolutely no impact on quality
7954920 one of the most significant job losses in australia this year
7954921 its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7954922 it doesnt involve reducing people but it does certainly involve slowing our expense growth over whats its been historically
7954923 with worldwide broadband subscribers predicted to exceed 500 million in 2010 there will be a very significant installed base of equipment that presents opportunities for replacements and upgrades
7954924 gigabit ethernet voip the dsl forums tr 69 and 802 11n are examples of drivers for cpe upgrades and replacements over the next several years but we see a potential issue in terms of consumers lack of knowledge regarding the benefits and differences between 802 11g and 802 11n which could spell trouble for 802 11n upgrades
7954925 im locked in for next year but there is still some stuff to sort out
7954926 it annoyed me when i realised i had been accused of faking an injury to stay off the field
7954927 faking an injury is the worst slur you can have i wanted to get back out there but the coaching staff and doctor told me i couldnt i would have given anything to get back out on the field
7954928 the fact he has asked for a release this year to me ive got my doubts about franks commitment to the team
7954929 it is always difficult to deal with a player when you dont know whether or not he wants to be at the club
7954930 you dont know what to believe but as for monday night i have got to believe frank if he said he wasnt right to go back on then ive got to go with him on that
7954931 if anything comes up in general business well discuss it but at the moment neither is on the agenda
7954932 we wouldnt consider letting him go we havent received any concrete offer anyway
7954933 he hasnt said he is unhappy and hasnt come to me saying he is unhappy
7954934 he is suspended indefinitely and on legal advice we cant do another thing
7954935 i think it is the only thing we could do
7954936 we will look at it at the time and as a board and take advice sorry i cant say much more about it but that is where we are at
7954937 they are pretty keen to see some action is taken
7954938 the club has a responsibilty to sponsors supporters management staff and the players
7954939 it is important that the values of society are upheld at every opportunity
7954940 that d prav manet should be permanently banned from the salon
7954941 i must ask that you step back from the painting
7954942 people are in an uproar over this douard manets painting
7954943 his olympia has offended many some actually wanted to deface it so the director has ordered the gallery closed until the painting can be re hung higher out of harms way
7954944 we will reopen tomorrow you might want to keep this lady out of this gallery though personally i wouldnt let my wife see that thing its way too risqu
7954945 it should be hung in a brothel not the salon

7954947 de politieke eis van transparantie vertaalt zich juridisch in het zorgvuldigheidbeginsel en het motiveringsvereiste onder meer de artikelen 3 2 en 3 46 van de algemene wet bestuursrecht schending daarvan levert voor de rechtbank sector bestuursrecht een vernietigingsgrond op resultaat dan blijven de bomen staan en gaat de kapvergunning voor de bijl
7954948 dit jaar organiseerde het stadsdeelbestuur negentien inspraakavonden onder meer over het amstelveld
7954949 aan hen die wonen werken aan het amstelveld en omgeving
7954950 is het stadsdeel gevraagd een nadere voor elke boom te geven deze motivering zal aan de kapvergunningsaanvraag worden toegevoegd
7954951 aan hen die wonen en werken aan het amstelveld en omgeving
7954952 doe even normaal trek de kapvergunning in treed in overleg met de buurtbewoners
7954953 heel graag horen we van u wat u met uw buurt wilt
7954954 maar als dat niet lukt komt u dan naar ons
7954955 wij doen ons best om het voor u begrijpelijk en aantrekkelijk te maken
7954956 de deelraad wil dat bewoners zich meer bemoeien met politieke besluiten
7954957 buurtbewoners en belanghebbenden zijn uitgenodigd om hun mening te geven
7954958 does a great copy have any impact on search engine rankings yes know the facts
7954959 vanuit de verantwoordelijkheid en de afgewogen inzichten is het voorstel om door te pakken
7954960 het gaat niet alleen om monumenten maar om het totaalbeeld dat gevormd wordt door de gebouwen straten pleinen grachten water bruggen en bomen
7954961 bleek dat het de wens van de buurt is om gezien de emotionele groenbeleving een langjarige fasering toe te passen
7954962 het dagelijks bestuur wil de consequenties van de verschillende opties onderbouwen de volgende aspecten worden in ogenschouw genomen de esthetische consequenties waaronder de
7954963 het op een zorgvuldige manier in beeld brengen van de consequenties vraagt meer tijd en aandacht
7954964 vanuit het juridische kader zijn alleen personen die zicht hebben op een boom op het amstelveld belanghebbend
7954965 die omschrijving geeft de de rechter de nodige ruimte om te differenti ren afhankelijk van de aard van de materie zal de kring van beroepsgerechtigden die door dit belanghebbende begrip wordt bepaald nu eens ruim dan weer beperkt zijn
7954966 omtrent de relevante feiten en de af te wegen belangen
7954967 beide pleinen zijn intiem waarbij het spui een werelds tintje heeft en de nieuwmarkt een stedelijk dorp is nergens is de dorpsheid van de grachtengordel zo evident als hier
7954968 omdat het bestuur het zo belangrijk vindt dat het plan door alle belanghebbenden wordt gedragen heeft het besloten extra geld ter beschikking te stellen en het plan vrijwel ongewijzigd over te nemen
7954969 hoe dan ook alle reacties zijn meegenomen en het dagelijks bestuur heeft ingestemd met het voorstel
7954970 we willen overleggen die ertoe doen waar de ondernemer of de bewoner zegt wat hem of haar bezighoudt maar die ook meedenkt met het bestuur over de beste oplossing voor de aanpak van een probleem

7954976 i know i cant go from 200 miles an hour to zero so i thought the consulting route was a good way to go
7954977 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7954978 now these next three days i think youre going to see an intensity of attack
7954979 but you know you dont want to get negative choppy every single day and i think what were seeing today here is a democratic party thats positive thats unified that wants to heal that wants to bring bipartisanship and you know ill talk about that too
7954980 if the republicans are good at anything they are experts at fear and smear divide and conquer
7954981 what we have to do though i think is rebut those charges but also to point out the real mccain record
7954982 understands a lot more about how people have to struggle economically than john mccain will ever in his whole lifetime

7954989 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed

7954996 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7954997 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7954998 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7954999 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7955000 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7955001 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7955002 we are very encouraged by the outcome of the follow up analysis as it is clear from the results that xepol brings relief from pain and muscle weakness to pps patients
7955003 we are very excited about this data as currently there is no medical treatment for pps and patients in the treated group have experienced a reduction in disease symptoms after just 12 months
7955004 it is very rewarding to see that xepol is demonstrating efficacy and the potential to help pps patients
7955005 we are looking forward to expanding the xepol treatment procedure following product registration
7955006 the picture is becoming clear not only are vaccines causing an epidemic of autoimmunity including type 1 diabetes but they are causing an epidemic of metabolic syndrome as the immune system acts to suppress the inflammation and autoimmunity caused by the vaccines current data shows that vaccines are much more dangerous than the public is lead to believe and adequate testing has never been performed even in healthy subjects the current practice of vaccinating diabetics as well as their close family members is a very risky practice
7955007 we are delighted to have demonstrated the effectiveness of nsl 101 this exciting new treatment has many over the counter applications
7955008 there are significant commercial opportunities for new additions to toothpastes ulcer gels toothache remedies as well as creams and ointments for stings and grazes nsl 101 may also have future commercial applications following minor cosmetic procedures nsl 101 is an opportunity to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and these new data could well provide us with a significant commercial advantage furthermore the results from the periodontitis trial demonstrate our ability to identify treatments that work in the clinic
7955009 a remarkable reduction in work incentives for our most economically productive citizens
7955010 how can limited government and fiscal restraint be equated with lack of compassion for the poor how can a tax break that puts a little more money in the weekly paychecks of working people be seen as an attack on the needy since when do we in america believe that our society is made up of two diametrically opposed classes one rich one poor both in a permanent state of conflict and neither able to get ahead except at the expense of the other since when do we in america accept this alien and discredited theory of social and class warfare since when do we in america endorse the politics of envy and division

7955047 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7955048 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
7955049 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7955050 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas

7955100 i came into the shop my parents chose the shoes and that was it they used to have leather soles and my father used to repair them when they wore out because in those days you could buy a piece of leather for the bottoms he would take this piece of leather and nail or stud it on
7955101 it was very exciting it was a new pair of shoes and you would feel quite posh when you went to school in them on a monday
7955102 they were precious because you only had one pair and you had to clean them every single night
7955103 it was always a saturday when you had new shoes your father would get paid on a friday and you would come in on saturday morning and take them home ready for chapel on sunday or school on monday
7955104 you couldnt wear them straight away you had to wear your old ones

7955139 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water

7955141 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok

7955180 if people were truly democratically involved the folly of the motorway proposal would be laid bare and other far superior ideas such as a direct rail link would come to the fore instead the public are merely told what is going to happen and presented with different route options for a motorway that it has already been decided will proceed any pretence that this is democratic or in line with best practice in sustainability is a sham

7955189 ich bedaure dass sich die rechtsauffassung meiner beh rde nicht durchgesetzt hat nach der die fischtreppe nicht als schadensminderungsma nahme anerkannt werden kann
7955190 damit sind unsere naturschutzrechtlichen vorbehalte in diesem punkt nicht zur geltung gekommen
7955191 das gilt nur bei analogen signalwegen nicht f r digitales satellitenfernsehen da machen sich die neuen besser auch das hochaufl sende hdtv k nnen die r hrenger te nicht leisten
7955192 wenn ich ein analoges kabel habe mir aber f r die zukunft alle t ren offenhalten m chte w rde ich einen lcd fernseher empfehlen der nicht zu gro ist und auch keine zu hohe aufl sung hat hd ready reicht vollkommen bei full hd muss das schwache analoge signal auf die h chste aufl sung umgerechnet werden das sieht dann unscharf aus und die farbtiefe fehlt die hautt ne sehen dann aus wie im zeichentrickfilm
7955193 auf jeden fall sollte man vom verk ufer im laden verlangen ein bild zu zeigen mit dem signal das man zu hause tats chlich hat die bilder sehen in den l den mit filmen von blu ray spielern supergut aus aber das haben viele ja zu hause gar nicht man sollte sich auch klarwerden dar ber ber welches signal man in zukunft sehen will wenn man jetzt analoges kabel hat und sp ter doch dvb t haben m chte dann ist es gut wenn ein dvb t tuner eingebaut ist
7955194 ich w rde nicht mehr als 32 zoll sprich 80 zentimeter nehmen viele haben sich verkauft und stellen erst zu hause fest dass der neue fernseher viel zu gro ist das t uscht in gesch ften unheimlich ich sage immer schneidet pappe in der gr e des fernsehers aus den ihr haben wollt und stellt sie dahin wo das ger t dann stehen soll die neuen ger te sind im 16 9 format sind also breiter die neuen sendungen laufen fast alle im neuen format so dass ein nur wenig gr erer neuer fernseher gleich ein viel gr eres bild bringt
7955195 full hd ist eine deutlich h here aufl sung als bei hd ready full hd entspricht dem sogenannten 1 080p man sieht unterschiede erst bei ger ten ab einem meter bildschirmdiagonale die regel ist dass man beim hd bild die zweifache bildschirmdiagonale als abstand zum bildschirm haben sollte das problem ist dann aber dass man gar nicht den ganzen bildschirm im blick hat weil das so nah ist das ist auch nicht angenehm weil man ja das ganze bild sehen will
7955196 plasma schirme fangen erst ab ein meter bildschirmdiagonale an von der bildqualit t her nehmen die sich nichts mit lcd tvs auch einbrenneffekte gibt es nicht mehr lcds haben aber als vorteil auch zu den r hrenger ten die matte frontscheibe man kann wenn man tageslicht hat ohne reflexionen auf dem schirm fernsehen
7955197 wir haben festgestellt dass die neuen lcd und plasma fernseher extrem geringe verbr uche im stand by haben gerade im vergleich zu den r hrenger ten es gibt wenige die deutlich ber ein watt kommen allerdings haben wenige ger te noch einen wirklichen ein und ausschalter je gr er desto h her der verbrauch fernseher mit einem meter bildschirmdiagonale schlucken 200 watt

7955805 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7955806 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7955807 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway

7955817 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2007

7955828 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7955829 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures

7955831 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty

7955839 america did not get superman from our greatest legends but because a boy lost his father
7955840 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7955841 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7955842 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7955843 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7955844 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7955845 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there
7955846 walter cronkite came on and they showed superman flying and he described what had happened at the end he said another triumph for truth justice and the american way

7955902 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
7955903 its not just deeply offensive to me and my team although it is but it also risks undermining confidence amongst the victims of child abuse that justice will be done
7955904 its really absolutely essential that any complainants or witnesses who have any evidence or any allegations they wish to make must tell the police what that evidence is so the complaints can be investigated
7955905 if the evidence is there the prosecutions will be brought and pursued with a great deal of vigour but i find the allegation of obstructing justice very unhelpful

7955939 we had been expecting the raids either on the coast or in hattiesburg we were getting information that ice was in hotels in the coast and other preparations were going on in hattiesburg
7955940 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate

7955950 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children

7955952 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse
7955953 i have performed several reductions and have never had a case where i lost all the fetuses she needed to know that
7955954 there are just no rules or protocols for doctors to follow in this country
7955955 laws will be passed and they are not followed or implemented no one had any idea what to do when it came to ghazalas births it sort of all just happened
7955956 women can actually get pregnant with seven eight or nine babies
7955957 we need to tell people that it is safe and that it is ok religiously
7955958 our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation

7956089 those things reflect the reputation that we have developed and the consistency we have shown its not that were trying to be brash or bold and make predictions our theme is based on what has happened and projecting that we would like to continue moving forward in a positive and productive way
7956090 i always say the road to the top is never easy
7956091 we had a kind of rough side of the mountain experience last year losing jackie areson to injury having rolanda bell disqualified at the regional meet in bizarre fashion and not having heidi magill dahl for more than 60 percent of the season
7956092 we stuck together tried to be the best we could possibly be and really had a growing experience for our entire team i believe that will help us get through whatever obstacles are in our way this year and aid in our goal to become a championship caliber team
7956093 this is probably the team with the most experience and leadership that ive ever had
7956094 you have sarah who is a senior now running very very well in cross country she is definitely able to show and guide a team in how i like things to be done
7956095 katie also is a good leader and runs very consistently
7956096 you put those two together and it makes this team very special im excited about having sarah and katie at the helm together guiding us through a season
7956097 her leadership also is known and respected as is rolandas its a nice experienced group im really going to need that because we have some young kids behind them rounding out the returnees are three more who have been in tennessees top five and a pair who have yet to break into the regular rotation knoxville tenn was an all sec and all south runner as a freshman in 2005 but she hasnt run for ut since 2006 due to injuries sophomore bellport n y returns after scoring in all six races a year ago holding down the three and four spots for clark also back is junior signal mountain tenn a three time scorer a year ago in the five slot has done in the past
7956098 her injuries have limited her the past couple of years from achieving what she is capable of doing we believe we have that under control now and look forward to her getting back in the fold and having fun
7956099 brittany was really learning the ropes in cross country last season and hadnt really run a full season in quite some time she surprised herself in how well she ran as a freshman and by scoring in every meet i look forward to seeing her grow in cross country as the years go by
7956100 phoebe definitely has the talent and i believe she can do well in cross country its just a matter of whether she wants do it or not and making a commitment to run at this level i believe she can do it and will train to do it it will be exciting to see what she can do and how far shell get
7956101 if they can stay healthy those two will do their best to contribute they have to run diligently to break into a spot that would travel but they have the ability to do it
7956102 in the state of tennessee kelsey and elizabeth were very highly ranked in cross country
7956103 they both stood out and grabbed my attention at the state meet i believe theyll be able to step up and contribute right away as should ally who had a really big pr in the mile last season
7956104 the rest of the group will have an impact as time goes along im just not sure whether it will be this year or next if its not this season in cross country at the least theyll get themselves strong for the track amp field campaign and be ready to help
7956105 coming into this fall only one person has left the group from a year ago
7956106 everyone else is back and were adding 11 others to the group
7956107 we will be projecting our dissent against state terror onto the courthouse with images and sound aimed at informing the palmy masses in this way we reaffirm our tautoko for the families whose houses were raided here in palmerston north and around the country and in particular the kaumatua who was incarcerated for 3 days during the raids last year without access to medical care resulting in hospitalisation
7956108 attempts by the police to lay charges under the terrorism suppression act tsa failed but people are still facing politically motivated charges under the arms act the day of action immediately precedes the start of the deposition hearing in auckland on 1 september

7956121 besides the single im going to ingest four other tracks
7956122 i had my emotional moment when anxiety hit and i couldnt control it i didnt want to take anything because i was attempting to breast feed my husband was going home to sleep because he has back problems rods pins and fused areas of his spine and wasnt doing well sleeping in the hospitals chair
7956123 but when he saw how upset i was he ended up staying the night and we shared the hospital bed together and it was the best moment ever and i will never forget it
7956124 rob was awesome he worked ten hours a day but still took care of the dishes the laundry and walking our dog we decided to hire a monthly cleaning service to take care of deep cleaning but rob really took on many of the duties i know he hates
7956125 i just stare at my son and cry i just love him so much it almost hurts
7956126 i was determined to breast feed madeline before she was even born but i had no idea how difficult and hard it would be for us the nurses in the hospital were not much help and because she was born on a saturday the lactation nurse was unavailable i tried and tried but felt like such a failure
7956127 i had my mom there to cook clean and help me with anything i needed my husband took two weeks off to help and bond with madeline but the one thing they couldnt help me with was nursing we had a doula at our birth and she came over to help she introduced me to soothies and a nipple shield i also went to the mother and baby wellness center associated with my hospital and the la leche league and got one on one assistance after many days without success the nurse at the wellness center finally discovered that madeline had an underdeveloped sucking mechanism she taught me how to help madeline develop a proper sucking method
7956128 i never expected that breastfeeding would be so difficult i figured put the breast out and let her suck away there were times when i thought i wasnt producing enough milk or that isabella wasnt getting enough because shed constantly fall asleep while nursing also being on call to nurse every two to three hours was grueling i never left isabellas side for the first two months
7956129 because i had a c section no one knew the extent of my recovery
7956130 between rob my mom and sister there was someone with me around the clock for the first week after that my mom went back to work but spent the night so that i would have help with night feedings and such i think i just appreciated the fact that my husband never questioned when id get back to normal he just let me recover in my own time and allowed me to relax of course having my mom and sister around to help him wasnt so bad had we been alone things might have been a bit more chaotic
7956131 ethan was so supportive madeline had colic so we would take turns rocking her patting her bottom and walking around the house he was a big help in that aspect

7956164 the modern nation state system basically developed in europe since the medieval period and it was extremely difficult for it to develop europe has a very bloody history an extremely savage and bloody history with constant massive wars and so on and that was all part of an effort to establish the nation state system it has virtually no relation to the way people live or to their associations or anythings else particularly so it had to be established by force and it was established by centuries of bloody warfare that warfare ended in 1945 and the only reason it ended is because the next war was going to destroy everything so it ended in 1945 we hope if it didnt it will destroy everything the nation state system was exported to the rest of the world through european colonialization europeans were barbarians basically savages very advanced technologically and advanced in methods of warfare but not culturally or anything else particularly and when the spread over the rest of the world it was like a plague they just destroyed everything in front of them it was kind of like ghengis khan or something they fought differently they fought much more brutally they had better technology and they essentially wiped everything else out the american continents a good example how come everybody around here has a white face and not a red face well its because the people with the white faces were savages and they killed the people with red faces when the british and other colonists came to this continent they simply destroyed everything and pretty much the same thing happened everywhere else in the world you go back to about the sixteenth century and the populations of africa and europe were approxiametly comparable a couple of centuries later the population of europe was far higher maybe four times higher why did that change well you know those were the effects of european colonialization so the process of colonialization was extraordinarily destructive and it in turn imposed the european nation state system on the world kind of a reflection of internal european society which of course was always extremely hierarchical and unequal and brutal and if that system continues i suppose it will continue to be hierarchical and unequal and brutal so i think other forms of social organization have to be developed and those forms are not too difficult to imagine i mean the united nations was an attempt to do something about it but it didnt work because the super powers wont let it work international law is the same story internatioan law is a method by which you might regulate the aggressive and destructive tendencies of the nation state the trouble is internatioan law doesnt have a police force there are no martians around to enforce it so international law will only work if the powers subjected to it are willing to accept it and the united states is not willing to accept it if the world court condemns us we simply disregard it its not our above the law were a lawless state and as long as the major powers in the world are lawless and violent and are unwilling to enter into international arrangemtns or other kinds of mechanisms which would constrain force and violence theres very little hope for human survival i would think

7956178 no doubt some of you legalistic 21st century killjoy pharisees have problems with a christian drinking alcohol how do i know well it is because christianity as of late has been chopped down by the likes of you to these six things namely 1 not watching or reading anything with the name harry potter on it 2 not going to r rated movies 3 not smoking cigarettes a cigar or a pipe there goes c s lewis and charles spurgeon 4 not listening to rock music 5 not watching cnn or msnbc this doesnt send you to hell just makes you dumb as hell 6 not drinking alcohol yep somehow the greatest story ever told has been reduced to some goofy self righteous denominations list of dos and donts

7956183 one of the most stunning outcomes from the barna survey was the moral pattern among adults under 25 the younger generation was more than twice as likely as all other adults to engage in behaviors considered morally inappropriate by traditional standards
7956184 examining peoples faith perspectives revealed that conservative evangelicals were the group most likely to follow traditional morality in fact according to george barna who directed the survey the results reflect a significant shift in american life
7956185 we are witnessing the development and acceptance of a new moral code in america
7956186 mosaics ages 18 25 have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior the moral code began to disintegrate when the generation before them the baby busters pushed the limits that had been challenged by their parents the baby boomers the result is that without much fanfare or visible leadership the u s has created a moral system based on convenience feelings and selfishness
7956187 the consistent deterioration of the bible as the source of moral truth has led to a nation where people have become independent judges of right and wrong basing their choices on feelings and circumstances it is not likely that america will return to a more traditional moral code until the nation experiences significant pain from its moral choices

7956294 to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college
7956295 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
7956296 how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house

7956298 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful
7956299 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive
7956300 certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
7956301 i think what has changed qualitatively as i have reflected on things over the past few weeks is that mr dion by laying down his program his alternative has now in fact made it impossible for himself and his party to work with the government or find any common ground with the government
7956302 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks

7956320 ive seen signs popping up that i am concerned about in fact and this isnt a secret i met with our team yesterday just because of some of the signs that ive seen it hasnt manifested itself in work ethic or preparation but again this is a different test because of the volume and the level of interest in the program and where the sources are coming from are so much more diverse than where theyve been
7956321 i really like the terms we us and ours and if i ever hear me or mine or i those things again because i dont read newspapers or web sites i have others scan the environment for me but when i see things like that those are alerts to me just that that is not who we are
7956322 i think it will be a constant process if we are able to maintain the success and consistency of how weve played the past couple of years
7956323 i would hate to do that because i believe so much in consistency
7956324 yet if our players and or those on the outside if their demands become unreasonable then i might have to do that
7956325 remains to be seen but i have been impressed with what i have seen
7956326 i wouldnt have changed it no matter who we were playing in our opener and it is just something that has evolved over the past four years

7956504 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us

7956551 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7956552 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7956553 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me

7956560 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7956561 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7956562 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7956563 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7956564 now that the technology is here we hope to finally do it the way that people who really care about music have always wanted to see it done

7956606 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7956640 of the three people who died in tiangia village two are christians and one is a hindu already two companies of raf and four companies of crpf have been deployed in kandhamal district another four companies of raf will soon arrive seven blocks of the district still remain very tense
7956641 in december the attack on the christian community was confined to kandhamal district but it has now spread to all districts the attackers are systematically targeting the christians as compared to the december attacks of last year when they targeted the church property and buildings they are targeting our priests nuns and others working in the churches
7956642 had the government apprehended the criminals who carried out the attacks in december it would have deterred them from carrying out similar attacks this time im dejected about the inaction of the government
7956643 peoples anger will subside only when the actual culprits who killed the swami will be nabbed the police cannot shift the blame to the naxals which is pure hogwash

7956652 if inflation is an issue till we see inflation easing then it would be unrealistic to expect any easing of monetary policy
7956653 should look at it very positively that an 8 9 growth is here to stay and this is backed by numbers
7956654 i am requesting the opposition to please come and talk
7956655 we are ready to discuss with so called unwilling farmers we are ready to formulate a package for those farmers who have no other livelihood and we are ready to discuss it
7956656 maybe the number is more but the government has a moral responsibility to accommodate these people but legally i just cannot give back the land
7956657 i am trying to convince them we are not egoistic we should reach a consensus otherwise how can we solve it i am optimistic that i will be able to convince them
7956658 theres nothing to talk about bow wow he dont want it hes too little i definitely accept it i got it
7956659 i think hell probably ask his mama for the money after he loses
7956660 i did have a crush on simon before going on the show he doesnt care about hurting peoples feelings and doesnt hold back with that he says for some reason thats so attractive
7956661 i feel like im in a really great place in my life and i love what im doing i love acting but i cant hire myself if this works then were in business if not i tried
7956662 its about putting into the universe what you want in life red means love pink is friendship green is lucky black is protection youre gonna have a story when you wear this bikini or when you put this dress on youll either get love or meet a new friend or you might meet a guy
7956663 they can definitely be annoying but at the end of the day these photographers are just doing their jobs one they probably never imagined they would have
7956664 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
7956665 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight films like this only serve to stir up those painful memories
7956666 i feel the film paints a picture of the police as being incompetent and biased
7956667 but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event
7956668 we are not taking sides just making a dramatic thriller and trying to explore racial bias
7956669 ya i know i hate life now i just wana kill people at champion high school and then blo my own head off
7956670 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7956671 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7956672 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7956673 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7956674 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7956675 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

7956679 ill star in the film and direct it is that too much responsibility
7956680 im passionate about being a director ive lots to say and i hope audiences accept me as a director as much as they have as an actor
7956681 my aim is not superstardom my target is to achieve what my grandfather did
7956682 im not making a conscious effort to walk in my fathers footsteps though hes my favourite actor and i dont mind being compared with him but i dont act or dance like him
7956683 it will bring a smile to the face a tear to the eye that rk films was famous for
7956684 hes just really into it with the family workshop he went to
7956685 she just got a taste of my new lifestyle we had spent a lot of time together before camp but it was never time like that being active and eating healthy
7956686 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
7956687 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy
7956688 i loved oreos and now i cant even look at that stuff
7956689 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
7956690 when i get there in the studio i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it
7956691 whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing

7956694 high fuel and feed costs have made 2008 pretty rough for the states swine industry but the loss of the market that bryan provided has created an additional hardship
7956695 the closing came at a time when producers in general were struggling because of the economy
7956696 if you factor in fuel costs you can understand why hog producers are being squeezed
7956697 theres no sign that either fuel or feed costs are going to let up significantly in the near future
7956698 the industry is still making adjustments in strategies to secure markets and fulfill contracts that were made prior to the closure of bryan foods
7956699 the obligation of the contract doesnt disappear along with the plant
7956700 with no local packing plant there is nowhere convenient for the end product to go
7956701 if you can only get 10 a head for 35 pound feeder pigs youre not covering costs and not making any money
7956702 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7956703 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7956704 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7956705 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7956706 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7956707 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7956708 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7956709 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7956710 change the landscape of food safety in the nation forever
7956711 each year 15 20 people die and countless others are hospitalized in the u s as a result of consuming fresh produce contaminated with food borne pathogens such as e coli
7956712 everyone involved with produce from the field to the plate must use the best agricultural and food preparation practices
7956713 electron beam irradiation or ebeam is an emerging technology that offers the potential to significantly enhance the level of safety of complex food items such as fruits and vegetables

7956720 therefore were going to look at how our community can respond to seemingly unprovoked rage what leads to that what its root causes are and what we can do to prevent it
7956721 educate the public on behaviors to watch in our coworkers in our family members and what we can do to stop interfere intercede intervene before these things happen
7956722 to create a dialogue about relations across the socioeconomic and political spectrum of our city
7956723 i first want to be sure that the community understands how city government works and how they can provide that service and also be a listening ear

7956739 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised

7956745 were going to try to redshirt tyrod taylor i think in the long term this is the best thing for our program and we want to get this done this is what we need to do if we can stay away from injuries and play well as an offense
7956746 for tyrod having a year to continue to learn and develop is only going to get him better and better
7956747 the two quarterbacks worked but one didnt put themselves ahead what we are hoping is that sean with his experience he has been successful in several situations he has made really good plays for virginia tech we want to play him and get tyrod taylor a redshirt so we can have him three more years in the long term that is good for virginia tech and that is our plan as of today well see how it goes
7956748 i think its in the long term best interest of our football program and what is in the best interest of the kid it gives him another year to develop and we can have him three more years
7956749 cory holt is our no 2 but if something happened we would go back to tyrod
7956750 we havent set a time on things things change quickly in this business from week to week and even quarter to quarter at this time this is what we want to do
7956751 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7956752 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7956753 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7956754 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7956755 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7956756 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7956757 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
7956758 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
7956759 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
7956760 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major
7956761 this is embarrassing we gotta get more people in here
7956762 id prefer to spend more time talking about senator obama

7956783 at amp t is expanding u verse services into south bend because of the progressive reform legislation that was supported by the indiana general assembly and gov daniels the telecom and video reform bill of 2006 created an environment that encourages new video providers such as at amp t to invest in indiana and bring consumers a new choice

7956785 an increase in water temperature of just a couple degrees celsius results in visible damage to adult corals and their offspring
7956786 corals are most vulnerable when they are very small and our protected nursery will help them to get through the first critical days
7956787 poachers often collect wild corals to satisfy the demand for aquariums but aquarium professionals are looking for alternative less destructive sources of these animals secores goal is to develop methods to eventually breed corals in captivity thereby reducing some of the pressure to collect corals from the wild
7956788 we are starting by raising juveniles from wild caught eggs and sperm which enables us to provide aquariums with the corals they desire without damaging wild adult colonies in return the aquarium operators help us to perform the experiments and give us tips on how to raise adult corals in captivity which is something they are very good at
7956789 it is quite likely the us could be arm twisting india through backdoor as if it gets a clean waiver new delhi might be having nuclear trade with 44 countries other than us in the nsg especially france and russia
7956790 there is a possibility that washington was putting pressure for conditionalities through some nsg members in an attempt to have the leverage over india in the purchase of reactor technology from the us
7956791 india may have to wait till such time when the nuclear suppliers group takes a realistic position and works on ground realities instead of coming under pressure of certain powers
7956792 in fact nsg should be asking the p 5 countries nuclear weapon states and others on their non proliferation record and details of their disarmament programme
7956793 otherwise there was no point in investing time and resources if we are made to toe the us line as in the case of tarapur where america reneged on its commitment to provide reactor fuel
7956794 nearly 1 25 lakh cusecs of water is flowing in the new course that kosi has taken and if it goes up to 4 to 5 lakh cusecs by the first fortnight of october it will become difficult to save the lives of the people a catastrophe does not fix its date of striking it has sent warning signals and we cannot ignore these
7956795 nearly 25 lakh people are waging a grim battle against the floods which have assumed proportions of a catastrophe the nature is putting my government to test once again but we will succeed

7956797 scotiabanks strategy of diversifying across business lines and geographies has enabled the bank to continue to perform well during a challenging period for the global financial services industry
7956798 offset by higher provisions for credit losses in some of our retail portfolios lower capital markets revenues compared to record levels for the same period last year and higher expenses to support growth initiatives
7956799 faced with recent disappointing results including steeper than expected volume declines and higher than expected increases in pet polyethylene terephthalate resin costs we initiated a comprehensive financial review of our business
7956800 it has now become clear that our previously announced target is out of reach
7956801 management believes that certain charges are not pertinent to day to day operational decision making in the business
7956802 in north america volume is declining at a higher rate than previously expected mainly due to heavier than anticipated national brand promotional activity
7956803 at the same time packaging costs are increasing more than previously anticipated driven by pet resin costs and the impact of the recent rapid strengthening of the u s dollar against its canadian counterpart
7956804 additionally higher than anticipated start up costs and shipment delays associated with the north american water project have lowered the expected profit contribution from this project for the balance of 2008
7956805 we are no longer on track to deliver our targets
7956806 arts and culture industries bring people together locally globally and virtually helping to bridge large geographic distances and create communities of interest
7956807 canada is a relatively small market dispersed across a large geography
7956808 therefore the success of many culture products and services depends significantly on international trade
7956809 this government has increased funding for the arts in total but every five years we go over all our funding programs to find which are the most effective some arts programs went down others went up
7956810 these technologies allow content producers to distribute their works to a wide audience and consumers to participate directly in creating cultural content
7956811 all of the oil platforms off texas and louisiana will probably be at risk but thats real long range
7956812 imperial energy has grown significantly from a pure exploration company and as imperial energy moves into the next phase of its development with production increasing further over the coming years it makes strategic sense to be part of a larger group
7956813 ovls financial strength and technical expertise will further enhance the attractive growth potential of the business in the tomsk region
7956814 there has been some suggestion that for political reasons russia was more comfortable allowing an indian company to acquire imperial
7956815 indians are looking to increase their access to oil basically to fuel their growing economy
7956816 in order to go to the next level and create more efficient electronics such as digital cameras we need to explore ways to make things smaller
7956817 this research shows that it is possible to create smaller ultra compact infrared optical components that can be integrated into existing semiconductor technologies while not sacrificing image quality
7956818 light imaging technology is a crucial component to the field of optoelectronics which uses light instead of electrons for carrying information and represents the next generation of combined optical and electronic platforms essential for future computers

7956859 long term care facilities are very demanding technical environments we selected motorolas enterprise wireless lan wlan solutions and mc70 enterprise digital assistants edas because these innovative wireless technologies ensure the security resiliency and high performance needed to support our critical mobile care applications
7956860 motorola delivers a comprehensive set of highly reliable mobility solutions for healthcare and the powerful combination of motorola and sigmacare enables our customers to focus on patients instead of paperwork

7956901 some people mistakenly think that a gentle and quiet spirit is displayed when a woman never speaks this has concerned some of the outgoing personalities because they dont know how to be a silent lump this is merely looking at externals certainly sometimes a quiet spirit will be exhibited by silence but not always and a quiet person can be all worked up on the inside this is missing the point a heart that is resting in the faithfulness of god is gentle and quiet it is not stirred up with worry and anxiety this gentle and quiet spirit is a calm peaceful spirit it is a tame spirit a gentled spirit i have often compared this kind of spirit to a glassy lake not turbulent or troubled but hardly showing a ripple in contrast the anxious spirit is like a stormy sea with whitecaps whipping along the shore this of course brings to mind our lord calming the troubled sea of galilee likewise he can calm our troubled spirits when we look to him

7956919 het is niet te geloven maar cora is betrokken geraakt bij een schandaal waarbij een substantieel geldbedrag is ge ist om het huwelijk door te laten gaan
7956920 cora is waarschijnlijk gemanipuleerd door mensen die mij kennen ik wil iedereen oproepen om n et uit te voeren wat er gepland is
7956921 cora dacht dat dit een heel gemeen programma was de masterminds achter deze actie hebben haar gebruikt

7956936 right now publishers are on a crash course with e textbooks
7956937 they are expensive and impractical for a large portion of the student population
7956938 my overarching question is how does the availability of this new choice hurt students
7956939 the cost is totally dependent on which book theyre talking about the cost of printer cartridges and other things
7956940 a student who wants to print out a whole book should buy a whole book
7956941 once a student buys a textbook it should be theirs to keep and access wherever and whenever they want
7956942 anything less than complete access would make digital books impractical for large numbers of students with limited access to computers and or the internet
7956943 since the departure of nicky shorey we have been looking to supplement the left hand side of our squad and the signing of chris armstrong has given is the opportunity to do that

7956953 i cant decide if its the stupidest thing daddy yankee did or the smartest thing mccain did
7956954 as a puerto rican myself i believe all puerto ricans should vote for conservatives it is embarrassing that puerto ricans support hillary clinton and democrats when the conservative ideals of faith and family strongly held by puerto ricans are ignored by democrats
7956955 its not like we expect much from daddy yankee politically speaking hell i dont even expect him to be aware of the upcoming presidential elections unless of course he reads vl in between perreos much less endorse a candidate
7956956 this just may be the missing link for john mccain hes been tagged as old disconnected and most recently elitist as ridiculous as this endorsement may seem i can assure you theres a boat load of hispanics out there right now scratching their heads i thought we were supposed to vote for the other guy what most hispanics fail to realize is how much our values are in line with the conservative republican agenda fyi im hispanic this not only gives him a hint of latino street cred but hooks him up with a bunch of opinionated young tweens looking to vote for president for the first time im not saying that they will vote for him but i think this will certainly bring hispanic voters to give him a second look
7956957 digital based electronic media formats are finally on the cusp of largely replacing all of the older analog electronic media formats
7956958 the video media has been slower to move from analog storage and transmission formats to digital storage and transmission formats than audio
7956959 however video is now finally rapidly moving from analog storage vhs and beta and analog transmission formats ntsc and pal to digital storage mpeg and digital transmission formats atsc
7956960 computer systems have been using various different digital video storage and transmission formats for a number of years
7956961 the mpeg 2 and mpeg 4 standards compress a series of video frames or fields and encode the compressed frames or fields into a digital stream
7956962 when compressing video frames an mpeg 2 and mpeg 4 encoder usually implements a rate controller that is used to allocate a bit budget for each video frame that will be compressed and encoded
7956963 a rate controller for allocating a bit budget for video frames to be encoded is disclosed the rate controller of the present invention considers many different factors when determining the frame bit budget including desired video quality target bit rate frame type intra frame or inter frame frame duration intra frame frequency frame complexity intra block frequency within an intra frame buffer overflow buffer underflow and the encoded video frame quality for a possible second pass

7956992 when elected mayor and pending the choice of the voting public on the extension of terms from three years to four i will take a serious look at the benefits of overall electoral reforms in kamloops by striking a committee that will consult with stakeholders and the community at large to come up with recommendations on possible electoral reforms for example items such as the establishment of electoral wards will be studied whereby each section of our city is equally represented on council also i believe term limits for both council and mayor ought to be in place ensuring that council has a mix of experienced members and new members with fresh sets of open ears eyes and minds this also ensures that no one sitting councillor or mayor accumulates an undue amount of influence at city hall

7957125 ms mcbride outdid herself with this story i immediately felt drawn to kerrie because of everything she had gone through over the years i felt bad for her that she had such lack of self esteem for herself i also fell in love with dace because he was the perfect knight in shining armor for kerrie he was everything that she had hoped to find in a man and so much more ms mcbride wrote this story from the heart and she even had me laughing at loud during some of the scenes pick up a copy of this story i assure you that you wont be disappointed you did a fantastic job bess

7957127 the state introduced evidence that cox spent almost every day at the hammer house where hammers mother lived both before and after the bond reduction hearing and up to the time of the shooting hammer and cox were close friends and hammers mother attended the hearing this evidence is sufficient to support the inference that cox had learned what transpired at the hearing
7957128 no queremos renunciar a esta riqueza a 6 000 metros de profundidad

7957130 resolver definitivamente el problema de la educaci n en este pa s resolver los problemas de millones de pobres y no dejarla en manos de media docena de compa as que piensan que el petr leo les pertenece
7957131 creo que el gobierno tiene dos visiones sobre crear una nueva compa a
7957132 una de ellas es la visi n nacionalista de controlar la producci n de crudo la otra es la de conseguir el m ximo beneficio
7957133 y esto sin tener en cuenta tupi seguramente tupi y el rea de pre sal aumentar n estas cifras sobre todo despu s de 2013
7957134 creo que brasil todav a mantendr su programa de etanol porque es un combustible m s barato que la gasolina por lo que no creo que exista ninguna contradicci n
7957135 probablemente brasil se convertir en uno de los mayores exportadores de productos petrol feros y continuar desarrollando sus biocombustibles y la bioenerg a dado que suponen un gran recurso para el pa s
7957136 brasil no cree que el etanol sea la soluci n para todo el mundo en t rminos energ ticos sino que s lo representa una peque a parte
7957137 es imposible sustituir todo el petr leo utilizado en el mundo por biocombustibles pero pueden jugar un rol importante a la hora de contribuir al desarrollo de pa ses que necesitan nuevas fuentes de ingresos
7957138 brasil deber a tener cuidado de no convertir al petr leo en su nico recurso financiero y usar este dinero para desarrollar otras industrias
7957139 it s like a greatest misses compilation of every democratic campaign idea ever conceived
7957140 in 2000 i felt id hit a wall in my position working for the state
7957141 thats when we decided to start our family and i ditched the nine to five i took up sewing creatively all the scraps id saved from sewing for my friend not to mention the experience id gained came in handy at that point and i taught myself patchwork
7957142 ive been following the success of bazaar bizarre since its beginnings in boston
7957143 i did my research i found out who would be in charge of the show and then i applied i couldnt have gone in on blind faith
7957144 after talking to people last year i swore to myself i would be involved this year in some way
7957145 as with any such event those of us in the indie craft community get a huge charge out of being surrounded by like minded people
7957146 i probably dont have to tell you that there are creative people here with absolute super powers
7957147 i actually have crafty crushes but aside from that austin is a city full of people who strive to be unique
7957148 austin is a progressive city and austinites are laid back but educated
7957149 you get the southern hospitality combined with a conscientious community
7957150 while the northern league leadership dismiss charges of racism there have been instances of speeches interviews and banners pointing to that
7957151 we should dress them up like hares and bang bang bang
7957152 one of the oldest myths about capitalism is the notion that factories that offer the poor higher wages to lure them off the streets and away from lives of begging stealing prostitution or worse or away from back breaking farm labor somehow impoverishes and exploits them
7957153 wal mart has undeniably been a glorious economic blessing for its mostly low and middle income customers has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs has enriched thousands of small business owners who supply its products has invented many new and superior management techniques and has been a driving force of a large segment of the entire us economy
7957154 therefore loyalty to ones cultural traditions from the way you talk to the faith you profess is a manifestation of a fear of progress and progress as we all know is the inevitable movement toward globalism and universalism that marxism promised love of ones own people then is not love but hatred of ones neighbors the motivation of the anti racist then is not justice brotherhood or concern for the downtrodden but the lust for power and treasure
7957155 separatism is the most revolutionary force in the world today
7957156 they took him to get to us he was just a ladder to me
7957157 what is it worth people shouldnt have to die for me
7957158 why dont you tell me how to do that why dont you tell me how to block it out numb it you must be an expert on that
7957159 they killed a good man to get to me its my fault hes dead its my fault that some poor innocent man is lying out on the street in a million pieces theres no way they can justify that
7957160 theyre not thinking about morals or justice theyre thinking about you and the letter theyre thinking about eliminating you they think they can weaken you or take you out by targeting the people you love he didnt die a coward that matters let that be your comfort
7957161 if you die too because of me ill never be able to live with myself if somebody else dies for me i wont be able to keep going why not just let them take me it should end here right here right now
7957162 dont say that ever again you hear me youre not going to give up youre not going to quit if you do youre quitting your family youre quitting what weve worked for together youre quitting me could you live with that valentina
7957163 why cant it all just go away i dont want my life anymore i dont want it i cant live this way anymore take me back home mark take me right now
7957164 youre going to find out soon enough because youre not quitting the ends not far and i wont let you quit now i cant youre moving on even if i have to drag you every inch of the way
7957165 you can justify his death by finishing this you will finish
7957166 just go away take my fathers money and run i dont need you anymore
7957167 if youre going to cry youre doing it here with me
7957168 no quitting isnt an option for me it never was you remember that
7957169 in denied origin amber leigh williams spins a nice tale of suspense during which the reader is taken on a journey around the world in several days this is a fast paced story that keeps the reader on the edge of the seat and guessing the action and sexual tension keep the reader wondering waiting and wanting more i can only imagine amber williams will get better and better and be well read her creativity is obvious with this appropriately named highly charged danger filled setting and story watch for her future works shes an amazing writer no doubt about it
7957170 someone had to take over when the old president left
7957171 i just feel that when you have a stroke youre often left feeling deserted i do it because i enjoy seeing people enjoying themselves we share a lot of laughs
7957172 next thing you know they have people in the middle of the street and the police horses blocked off the back of me so i couldnt get out
7957173 they were pushing people back and pushing people back and as they were pushing they were shooting off the pepper ball guns they were shooting off the mace
7957174 at least one squad charged in grabbed somebody from the crowd and held them for a minute and then threw them back in
7957175 i have no idea who i have no idea why no one in the crowd was doing anything illegal
7957176 apparently some of the arrests were very specifically targeted we dont know what the basis of the targeting is
7957177 after a crowd of people rushed a police line and refused police orders to disperse

7957185 excepto entre ac litos y tecn cratas aquello de que el estado se desvanece y todo debe dejarse a la mano invisible del mercado aparece como otra estafa de reagan y thatcher algo similar se observ en el periodo librecambista de la crisis de 1870 al terremoto militar iniciado en 1914 desde entonces la relaci n entre mercados desregulados crisis y guerra ha estado en el n cleo de la indagaci n de la ciencia social el caos de 1929 mostr que los mercados dejados a su din mica invariablemente colapsan

7957194 serie que muestra los mbitos m s extremos de la vida com n donde las mujeres son sus protagonistas
7957195 inscrita en un ciclo recurrente y no como una anomal a o un episodio espor dico
7957196 en el mbito externo el escenario para los ee uu ha continuado deterior ndose generando alta volatilidad y mayores riesgos en los mercados financieros internacionales los bancos centrales de los principales pa ses desarrollados han adoptado medidas adicionales para atenuar los problemas de liquidez hasta ahora las econom as emergentes no se han visto mayormente afectadas aunque el riesgo de escenarios adversos se ha incrementado por su parte los precios de productos b sicos han presentado aumentos significativos
7957197 sector lo dominan empresas multinacionales y grandes exportadores nacionales que por esta v a aceleran la concentraci n de la riqueza mientras ellos gozan de precios record e inusitadas ganancias les afecta muy poco la apreciaci n artificial del peso en tanto las industrias manufactureras y agropecuarias peque as y medianas sufren una p rdida de rentabilidad no compensada por el precio de sus bienes exportados
7957198 la revaluaci n artificial del peso es entonces resultado de un boom de un sector exportador que ha gozado de bajas regulaciones tributarias laborales y ambientales y que ahora se beneficia del alza de sus precios de exportaci n
7957199 los primeros son aquellos cuyos productos est n muy altos en los mercados mundiales a estos la reevaluaci n del peso les reduce sus m rgenes de utilidad como en el caso del cobre pero les sigue yendo bien a los segundos exportadores que no tienen precios altos y que est n asociados al agro les afecta negativamente
7957200 los especuladores internacionales con su entrada incontrolada y de magnitudes desmesuradas aumentan a n m s la sobrevaloraci n del peso
7957201 son fuertemente golpeados con la reevaluaci n del d lar
7957202 chile nunca ha vuelto a los niveles de desocupaci n de la crisis del 98 no obstante ahora se est regresando las peque as y medianas empresas son las que ofrecen m s empleo en chile pero ahora est n siendo tocadas por la reevaluaci n del d lar y las tasas de inter s de los bancos comerciales s lo a veces se les otorga cr dito y si se les brinda es a tasas descomunales que conduce a que esos bancos tengan ganancias muy elevadas y perciban financiamiento del banco central con tasas de inter s negativas es decir para la banca es un negocio redondo
7957203 aqu se van a producir tremendos errores en pol tica econ mica porque hay un mal diagn stico porque subiendo la tasa de inter s y bajando la demanda interna no van a bajar el precio internacional del petr leo esa medida lo nico que har es reducir la capacidad de endeudamiento de los grupos m s pobres del cr dito al consumo del cr dito a la inversi n a la compra de vivienda los proyectos de inversi n de muchas empresas por lo tanto reducir el nivel de actividad econ mica con efectos negativos
7957204 en 2005 lee scott su director y ceo gan 23 millones de d lares una cantidad nada de excepcional entre los gerentes y directores de las grandes empresas hoy en d a en cambio los sueldos pagados a los trabajadores s pueden resultar sorprendentes por lo bajos el sueldo promedio de un empleado es de 18 mil d lares anuales menos de la mitad ajustada la inflaci n a los sueldos que hace 35 a os atr s ganaban los empleados de la general motors
7957205 la primera es el fin del papel que ten a el d lar estadounidense como divisa de reserva para el mundo lo cual hace imposible continuar la pol tica de superendeudamiento del gobierno de estados unidos y de sus consumidores la segunda es el regreso a un alto grado de proteccionismo tanto en el norte como en el sur globales la tercera es el regreso a la adquisici n estatal de las empresas que fracasan y la implementaci n de medidas keynesianas la ltima es el retorno a pol ticas redistributivas m s enfocadas al bienestar social
7957206 de aqu a 10 a os se escribir acerca de la globalizaci n neoliberal como un oscilamiento c clico en la historia de la econom a mundo capitalista la cuesti n real no es si esta fase termin sino si el retorno pendular podr restaurar como en el pasado un relativo equilibrio en el sistema mundo o se habr hecho ya demasiado da o estaremos en un caos m s violento en la econom a mundo y como tal en el sistema mundo como un todo
7957207 todo el que haya echado una mirada a la prensa internacional sabe que el mundo est en el medio de un gran remez n financiero los remezones de la econom a internacional incluyendo un crecimiento m s incierto de nuestros socios comerciales y los altos y variables precios de la energ a son sin duda los riesgos que hay que mirar con m s atenci n en los dos a os que vienen
7957208 la magnitud de las p rdidas calculadas desde el inicio de la crisis hacen imbancable literalmente la continuaci n de este esquema de postergaci n de la bancarrota
7957209 los quebrantos que llevan registrados los bancos de estados unidos y europa suman ya unos 200 000 millones de d lares pero nadie estima que puedan ser inferiores a los 400 000 millones y algunos los prev n en un bill n de d lares a esto se le suman ahora los incobrables por cr ditos al consumo y por las tarjetas pero por sobre todo la previsi n de una recesi n o sea de una ca da del pbi por lo menos durante m s de medio a o

7957211 la presidenta tiene en sus manos la ltima esperanza que tienen los chilenos confiamos en que se hayan hecho los cambios necesarios
7957212 la diferencia de precios se explica en buena parte por la mayor cobertura y servicios anexos sobre la base de que existen en la regi n ciudades que no cuentan con una cobertura completa de agua potable y alcantarillado y el tratamiento de aguas residuales es insuficiente
7957213 la iniciativa que impulsa el presidente venezolano junto a otros pa ses tendr para bien o para mal gran relevancia en nuestra regi n
7957214 que tambi n nacieron para promover inversiones pero se convirtieron en verdaderos castigos para los pueblos ya que invaden e intervienen en las decisiones econ micas de los pa ses
7957215 la pol tica actual en materia de reservas internacionales es en muchos aspectos absurda debido que se adapta a la ortodoxia de las instituciones financieras internacionales en lugar de utilizar una parte importante de sus divisas en gastos de inversi n y en gastos corrientes en los mbitos de educaci n y salud por ejemplo los gobiernos de los pa ses en desarrollo las emplean para desembolsar su deuda o la prestan al tesoro estadounidense pero esto no es todo los gobiernos de las naciones emergentes usan las reservas en divisas como garant a de pago futuro y contraen nuevas deudas con bancos privados extranjeros o en los mercados financieros es absurdo desde el punto de vista del inter s general
7957216 si tus gastos en educaci n no son peque os y no obtienes buenos resultados entonces tienes dos problemas
7957217 muchos sistemas educativos en am rica latina congelan las diferencias socioecon micas en lugar de actuar como grandes promotores de la igualdad no son efectivos para atenuar las diferencias sociales y econ micas
7957218 la tendencia en la pisa ya exist a estamos muy por debajo del promedio internacional en comparaci n con am rica latina podemos estar bien tal vez levemente por encima pero no puede interpretarse esta situaci n como un triunfo el avance ha sido muy menor y hay d ficit por todas partes
7957219 hay que observar otros indicadores como la prueba simce el sistema de evaluaci n anual del ministerio de educaci n chileno o los resultados de la psu prueba de selecci n universitaria y aqu hay una relaci n directa entre los resultados educacionales y las diferencias socioecon micas de la poblaci n la educaci n en chile lo que hace es reproducir estas enormes desigualdades y los recientes resultados de la psu confirman este estancamiento
7957220 tras la revoluci n de los ping inos el 2006 y la instalaci n del consejo asesor de educaci n el gobierno ha vuelto las cosas a sus mismos cauces incluso ser peor los ping inos y el consejo asesor hicieron propuestas y crearon borradores muy interesantes para reformar la educaci n chilena pero finalmente el gobierno en un pacto con la derecha arm un proyecto que enviar en estos d as al congreso que consolida el lucro y la selecci n de alumnos en el sistema educacional
7957221 que lucren los privados con sus propios recursos pero no con los recursos p blicos y tampoco puede mantenerse la selecci n de alumnos en todo el sistema todo ello lleva a la discriminaci n y a la competencia
7957222 hay un desgaste del gobierno en este tipo de pol ticas que privatizan los servicios como sigue sucediendo con el transantiago con la educaci n y con otros tantos eso est fracasado se quiere conciliar lo p blico y lo privado conciliar negocios con servicios que son derechos humanos este esquema ha fracasado en am rica latina

7957226 ya sea en los medios de comunicaci n e informaci n en la pol tica en las empresas o en la propia ciudadan a se percibe como una avanzadilla de infociudadanos que obtiene todo el partido a lo que ya es
7957227 a estas alturas disponemos de los instrumentos para liberar nuestra capacidad como productores cambiando por completo la faz de una web que hab a pertenecido mayoritariamente a las organizaciones empresariales y a los usuarios tecn filos m s avanzados
7957228 internet es un medio que ha cambiado la manera de comunicarse en medios como fresqui los usuarios son los que tienen el poder de decidir qu es lo relevante y qu es lo que debe estar en portada la comunidad decide no hay control editorial jer rquico como existe en los medios tradicionales es la propia comunidad la que se auto regula son las personas que forman parte de este nuevo concepto de medio las que llevan las riendas del medio y lo dirigen hacia donde la mayor a decide ir
7957229 la comunicaci n entre los medios y su audiencia ha pasado de ser unidireccional a ser bidireccional ahora la comunicaci n es conversaci n los usuarios pueden comentar opinar e incluso generar y difundir ellos mismos la informaci n en internet existen las herramientas adecuadas y con los costos m nimos para poder hacerlo los cms sistemas de publicaci n de contenidos din micos basados en software libre blogs comunidades en las que podemos compartir fotos v deos textos enlaces experiencias etc han facilitado que esto suceda la antigua audiencia pasiva ahora es activa las grandes corporaciones y los grandes medios tienen que aprender a escuchar a su audiencia y sta debe aprender a comunicarse con los medios
7957230 con el mayor nivel socioecon mico y educativo del internauta promedio como con el hecho de que frente al computador se ejercen activamente las funciones de la lectoescritura
7957231 las condiciones en que puede haber mayor o menor influencia pol tica de esta herramienta depende de factores m s all de los tecnol gicos institucionales culturales hist ricos o de simple desarrollo econ mico
7957232 a primera vista pareciera que tal ocurri con las antiguas esperanzas de que la telegraf a y de la radio acercar an m s a los ciudadanos a sus gobiernos las personas tienen expectativas desmesuradas respecto a internet y que basta con convertirse en un usuario para darse cuenta de que eso es ilusorio

7957276 could the democrats be about to nominate the wrong obama
7957277 well probably not but michelle obama baracks wife gave an awfully good speech at the while barack can sometimes soar off into the clouds michelle tends to keep things down to earth
7957278 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7957279 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7957280 i come here as a mom whose girls are the and the center of my world
7957281 one of the best most moving intimate rousing humble and beautiful speeches ive heard from a convention platform maybe she should be running for president
7957282 should go a long way to reassuring joe average if not joe wingnut that michelle obama has figured out how to be a first lady for her time
7957283 never before in recent memory has a potential first lady seemed so confident and comfortable in the glare of the spotlight not only did she deliver a speech with an effective message family family family but she delivered it flawlessly
7957284 oh dear the obama daughters are on stage talking with daddy via remote while hes campaigning in kansas city lots of hi daddy mommy looks cute
7957285 i miss the old michelle and i think a lot of other women do too
7957286 not the scripted stepford wife fist bumping chat show hostess
7957287 at the same time in 2007 that this spin was being conducted barack obama was campaigning and talking about expanding access to health care and bringing to more americans even as this medical center was using his strategist to cut off access for poor people in chicago
7957288 the leader in documenting exposing and neutralizing liberal media bias
7957289 this does seem to be an absurd hypocrisy that the media members should be all over dont you agree given obamas position on the poor and the uninsured if this issue gets little or no additional coverage one has to wonder why

7957291 client virtualization will be very big but tech populism will be even bigger
7957292 theres a mind shift happening in it and were starting to see that change theyre loosening up their policies on whats acceptable
7957293 in the end they want their employees to be as productive as humanly possible so theyll approve tools that people are more comfortable with the tools they may be running at home
7957294 theyre saying if we can find some way to manage and support these we will
7957295 its all just less about what end users clients are running
7957296 certainly some businesses and also some u s government agencies will explore diversifying their portfolios
7957297 weve talked to some who have explicit goals to have macs account for 10 percent of their client base for example but i think apple will continue a slow but steady increase not accelerate

7957309 having the opportunity to play both the sec and big ten champion will challenge our team early in the season playing exempt tournaments and neutral site games are all part of our scheduling philosophy i want to know who we are and where we need to go
7957310 only playing 14 home games is a concern for me but is something we just have to deal with i think this schedule is challenging and fair
7957311 people talk about unbalanced schedules but when you get into league play there is no unbalanced schedule because every single game is an event and you need to play at a very high level to have a chance to win

7957331 i still havent made up my mind theyre both really good candidates
7957332 theyre both very knowledgeable of what farm bureau policies are and they know what we are counting on
7957333 i didnt learn these issues that im dealing with with committees or task forces
7957334 even though im in the manufacturing business we have the same issues that these people have in the farm businesses the family businesses
7957335 i have a good degree of understanding as to how to follow through with these measures as they work their way through the congressional process
7957336 i would commit to roll my shirt sleeves up and apply that same work ethic that i have through my years of service
7957337 it just shows that you get people out of the mainstream who are running committees
7957338 i think thats a difference that i wouldnt vote for nancy pelosi who appoints those people to be committee chairpersons
7957339 id like to think that being in the majority would have a bearing obviously in the house being able to produce and helping to turn the economic situation around with the majoritys support
7957340 i think both candidates bring a lot to the table
7957341 they both are looking for a way to work with those farm issues on a national level
7957342 its made a tremendous impact on the wellbeing of our employees
7957343 were hoping to control that 5 million so it doesnt grow
7957344 weve been able to do a lot over the past year from a more aggressive recycling program to energy and water conservation efforts to creating and implementing environmental initiatives for the entire stern community

7957347 we are proud of the scgi for their win and look forward to working with them to achieve the ambitious goals they have set for the next year
7957348 while the doomers continue to focus on the plight of those homeowners that are suffering from financial stress from job loss and payment resets those observers and analysts with perhaps more savvy are seeing some solace in the fact that the market is absorbing as many of these distressed properties as it is suggesting that the housing consumer that has been absent from the marketplace for many months is stirring as he perceives better values

7957363 it will not end the drought it will make a dent

7957389 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7957390 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening

7957525 to humans that sounds very short but bats operate on a completely different timescale
7957526 the time from detection of an insect to capture is often less than a second typically when they approach an insect they wait only 20 to 50 milliseconds between sounds so if they go silent for 600 or 800 milliseconds thats a long time for them
7957527 there has been a lot of speculation that they could do this but i think this is possibly the first demonstration that they are listening to other animals calls in addition to their own
7957528 when one bat went silent it was typically trailing another bat so it was in a good position to listen to the echoes and vocalizations produced by the leading bat
7957529 we see spectacular emergences like carlsbad caverns where millions of bats are emerging every night and ask how on earth can they all be taking notice of their own echolocation call

7957593 state representative erik paulsen may wish he could run but he cant hide from the fact that hes a george bush republican who has spent the past 14 years playing partisan political games at the expense of minnesotans
7957594 in the last presidential election it was none other than erik paulsen who was up front and center rooting for bush at a campaign rally that he hosted proudly proclaiming that bush was just like himself
7957595 with paulsens record of voting with his party over 90 of the time on key votes in recent sessions and his years at the capitol twisting arms to win partisan votes as gop majority leader theres no doubt that paulsens speech will be music to the ears of the republican political insiders who are descending on our state next week
7957596 paulsen might have pretended that he was leery of addressing his fellow republicans at the rnc convention but with a record like his he wont be able to fool minnesotans into believing he is now an independent voice they can trust
7957597 considered turning down the invitation to speak at the republican national convention but took a september 1 speaking slot because it didnt conflict with any other plans
7957598 he wont even tune in to watch president george w bushs speech a few hours after his own
7957599 bush is so straightforward and real like myself my neighbor or any regular person

7957915 if i needed two points and i could choose any player in the 2010 class to go to id post up sullinger

7958010 what do you mean i like it read it but do you think the decade is over
7958011 if split brain patients are given such tests the left hemisphere generates many false reports but the right brain does not it provides a much more veridical account
7958012 if i look at the numbers across the province the number is about 8 000 fewer students last year so we are basically in a decade of decline
7958013 this isnt a b c problem it is the worlds problem
7958014 a new component to the program is the expectation that daily physical activity will be introduced in schools all our k 9 students will have 30 minutes of activity each day and high school students will have 150 minutes per week

7958022 i spent those 5 1 2 years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7958023 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes and thats what i know how to do

7958029 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7958030 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7958031 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership

7958041 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals

7958073 this was a paid advertisement these are not the opinions or views of the sioux falls school district
7958074 alpha center had the same right to advertise as any other organization
7958075 a good 20 000 students will glance through this directory
7958076 a this is not just a directory for parents dont kid yourself a good 20 000 students will glance through this directory
7958077 if the sf school district had called up planned parenthood and given them an opportunity to put an ad in the directory that wouldve been fine by me
7958078 but instead they let this ad go in when there also just happens to be an abortion ban on the ballot this fall
7958079 ads about churches or the national guard do not even compare to this ad so thats a ridiculous assertion
7958080 the ad for the alpha center presents information to young girls in a way that appears factual but in reality is only a very biased opinion
7958081 the public school system should have been smart enough to know not to infringe upon families rights to teach their children about these sensitive issues instead of having one viewpoint pushed upon them as if it is fact
7958082 the point is the publication is from sioux falls schools a supposedly secular apolitical government entity accepting advertising from either side of this issue would be and is inappropriate

7958089 we are aware of it and we are addressing it
7958090 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico

7958092 the full body unit is an excellent treatment for patients who have vitiligo all over their body and they need the treatment everywhere but the disadvantage for someone who has just a limited area youre exposing their normal skin to uv light thats unnecessary

7958101 its very appropriate to be aware of who you are dealing with and who youre hiring that might be dealing with your clients personal information

7958107 for a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin real life but there was always some obstacle in the way something to be gotten through first some unfinished business time still to be served a debt to be paid at last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life this perspective has helped me see that there is no way to happiness happiness is the way so treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one happiness is a journey not a destination
7958108 promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true think only of the best work only for the best and expect only the best forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future give so much time to improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others
7958109 peace it does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise trouble or hard work it means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart
7958110 whether you think you can or you think you cant youre right
7958111 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
7958112 to laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded
7958113 the greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall i learned that courage was not the absence of fear but the triumph over it the brave man is not he who does not feel afraid but he who conquers that fear there is no passion to be found playing small in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living
7958114 you may encounter many defeats but you must not be defeated in fact it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are what you can rise from how you can still come out of it

7958222 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7958223 barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7958224 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country

7958337 this study is important because it shows that many people looking for their dream home have had much of their time wasted on having to search through screen after screen of bad data it really is a case of buyer beware
7958338 we were careful to tease apart the data to be sure we were making an apples to apples comparison of the listings in these markets
7958339 the data here clearly show as they did in a national study we conducted earlier this year that a site based on information from a local mls will give consumers a more accurate picture of whats available in a local market
7958340 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

7958389 the framework at bowdoin is the kind of africana studies ive always envisioned
7958390 to see faculty colleagues in history english sociology anthropology music and several other humanities and social science disciplines who are deeply committed to building a serious interdisciplinary program in africana studies is a truly progressive idea
7958391 africana studies came out of a critical moment in united states and world history the intersection between the great african american freedom movement and global decolonization in the 1950s 60s and 70s
7958392 inevitably students in such an environment have a wonderful range of courses to choose from and scholars to help them embark on whatever their interest will be im excited about the prospect of working with the programs excellent faculty and teaching bowdoins outstanding students and im very pleased to see the deans deep commitment to an innovative interdisciplinary program in africana studies

7958438 some of them are still alive theres blood everywhere its the most unhygienic thing ive ever seen
7958439 they slaughtered too many couldnt process them then dumped them in the garbage
7958440 they buy chickens hire a shochet and have no supervision its true it got out of hand
7958441 there were people walking around from place to place checking

7958585 people have paid good money to come to the ground and are rightly angry not to get a proper game
7958586 but we must give credit to england we didnt apply ourselves and it starts rolling before you know it kevin and his team deserve victory
7958587 its just not good enough on the field at the moment were not playing to the standard we know we are capable of
7958588 england are playing a dominant brand of cricket but for us this is a tough pill to swallow
7958589 today was very special but we are a long way from finishing this series games three four and five are important
7958590 we need to get ourselves right and enjoy this evening because wins like this are very very special
7958591 im not going to stand here and say this is the best team weve had and its the start of great things but if we keep training hard im sure we wont be too far wide of the mark
7958592 obviously im delighted the bowlers put their hands up and to bowl them out for 80 odd was great as was the way belly and matty knocked them off
7958593 theres a long way to go in this series but we are playing good cricket
7958594 it was one of those days for south africa but we bowled exceptionally well there was hardly a ball below 86mph which created real pressure
7958595 because the bowlers are tall with bounce and pace its difficult to bully those kind of bowlers early on
7958596 it is an exciting team on paper and steve harmison coming out of retirement has been a real boost we have had roughly the same players for the last 18 months but the roles are changing slightly
7958597 it looks like a side with depth with bowling and batting as well as fielding so we must not let up ahead of the oval
7958598 it is a great start for kevin he is loving it and he is seeing life through the captains lens in the right way hopefully long may it continue
7958599 matt prior also kept well took a spectacular catch and took six catches as well as making runs at the top with ian bell
7958600 both matt and ian are coming back to do a role they have done before and obviously it is a tough job which they are getting used to
7958601 sometimes we maybe ask a bit too much because the ball does nip around and as an opener you have to dig and that takes a lot of mental strength
7958602 there is no proof that water runoff into a lake is harmful

7958616 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7958617 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7958618 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7958619 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7958620 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7958621 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7958622 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7958623 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7958624 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

7958635 how do you interpret these findings is this good news or bad news
7958636 i find these statistics very interesting in light of the fact that the pew post election survey of 04 showed bush with 78 of the white evangelical vote
7958637 the african american ethnicity like any other is proud of their culture and heritage and is thus going to stand behind someone from their own nationality
7958638 i also think that the survey shows that white evangelicals are going to vote according to their conservative republican party and are loyal to their affiliation

7958692 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7958693 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7958694 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7958695 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7958696 i was scared for the museum on august 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself
7958697 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
7958698 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
7958699 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
7958700 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7958701 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
7958702 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
7958703 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
7958704 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
7958705 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts
7958706 people have always come here from all over the world those who love stalin those who hate stalin and those who are just interested in him

7958715 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7958716 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7958717 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7958718 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse

7958726 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7958727 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7958728 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones

7958853 since we had so many people anxious to purchase right away we changed the strategy and went to sale immediately
7958854 despite the recent climate we are seeing a steady flow of traffic through the sales center
7958855 from everything we see these prices and these products are completely underserved in the marketplace
7958856 in terms of residential thisis the first time weve seen this kind of density in downtown this is a change in how people live
7958857 my gut reaction is with the downtowns becoming so attractive the traffic congestion got people thinking about living downtown where they can walk to things
7958858 but new buildings have got to be built where there is stuff happening and people can walk to their jobs restaurants and the cleaners
7958859 the headlines are certainly bad for single family residential homes in outlying markets

7958892 tenho o costume de tomar nota de todos os acontecimentos de que me cabe participar
7958893 the benefits of a downtown high rise are really bringing the services to the place you live
7958894 every sacrifice you make for a yard or attached garage is more than made up for with restaurants nearby hotel rooms for your guests views easier transportation
7958895 since we had so many people anxious to purchase right away we changed the strategy and went to sale immediately
7958896 from everything we see these prices and these products are completely underserved in the marketplace
7958897 in terms of residential this is the first time weve seen this kind of density in downtown
7958898 my gut reaction is with the downtowns becoming so attractive the traffic congestion got people thinking about living downtown where they can walk to things
7958899 but new buildings have got to be built where there is stuff happening
7958900 the headlines are certainly bad for single family residential homes in outlying markets
7958901 i wouldnt call it a slam dunk in todays market the stock market is unsettled the economy is doing well but its not an outright boom
7958902 the big question is whether they hit the demographic the right way
7958903 affordability is not really an issue silicon valley wages tend to be high quite a bit higher by national standards
7958904 youve got high incomes and good job growth especially for the luxury end of the market
7958905 the minute three sixty and the axis opened up with prices over 700 a square foot people saw that and realized what a great value city heights was
7958906 i am extremely confident for the downtown market and the high rise product
7958907 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care

7958911 ada empat sifat yang bila dimiliki maka pemiliknya adalah munafik murni
7958912 dan ketahuilah kamu bahawa sesungguhnya harta harta kamu dan anak anak kamu adalah fitnah ujian dan sesungguhnya allah di sisinya balasan yang sangat besar
7958913 bersegeralah kamu mengerjakan amalan amalan bagi menolak fitnah yang datang seperti kegelapan malam yang gelap gelita pada sebelah pagi seseorang itu beriman dan pada sebelah petangnya ia menjadi kafir dan pada sebelah petangnya ia beriman dan pada sebelah paginya ia menjadi kafir dia menjual agamanya dengan harta benda dunia
7958914 sebaik baik pemimpin kamu adalah orang yang kamu cintai mereka pun mencintai kamu kamu mendoakan mereka mereka pun mendoakan kamu dan seburuk buruk pemimpin kamu adalah orang yang kamu benci dan mereka pun membenci kamu kamu melaknat mereka dan mereka pun melaknat kamu

7958919 all my life ive been incapable even of picturing any other love and ive reached the point now of sometimes thinking that love consists precisely in the right voluntarily granted by the beloved object to be tyrannized over in my underground dreams as well i never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle for me it always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation and afterwards i couldnt even picture to myself what to do with the subjugated object
7958920 whatthefeck its just a frickin date for crying out loud
7958921 all my life ive been incapable even of picturing any other love and ive reached the point now of sometimes thinking that love consists precisely in the right voluntarily granted by the beloved object to be tyrannized over in my underground dreams as well i never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle for me it always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation and afterwards i couldnt even picture to myself what to do with the subjugated object
7958922 blogcritics brings us closer to an open community of bloggers and the audience that follows them it also gives us a lot more advertising inventory whats in it for them our combined resources will help that community grow and expose their work to an even wider audience well also work more closely with blogcritics authors so they can monetize their own blogs
7958923 all my life ive been incapable even of picturing any other love and ive reached the point now of sometimes thinking that love consists precisely in the right voluntarily granted by the beloved object to be tyrannized over in my underground dreams as well i never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle for me it always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation and afterwards i couldnt even picture to myself what to do with the subjugated object

7958928 oh god if i should forget jerusalem let my right hand forget its cunning
7958929 the fact of the matter is the security barrier has brought suicide bombings down to virtually zero and it isnt even complete yet
7958930 israel and the disputed territories of the west bank and gaza strip
7958931 they the israelis are doing a better job than their neighbouring countries
7958932 if we want to play silly games my daddys bigger than your daddy weve been here longer than you etc lets remember that ancient philistia or falestin was well and truly occupied long before the hebrews straggled out of the desert and settled in what is now the west bank
7958933 can muslims now accept the fact other faiths are now back living amongst them for good and that they may never again rule the majority of the land that was once known as palestine and now after accepting both those political and religious facts concentrate their political struggle on installing a safe secure secular government in what litttle bit of palestine they have left rather than failing to recognise the rights and faith of others
7958934 i am suggesting that there will be no lasting peace until it is achieved
7958935 there will be no lasting peace until both parties establish a colony on mars working in harmony with one another to sustain inter planetary life
7958936 as far as the palestinians are concerned since after all many of them come from what is now israel their homelands are there their houses are there their farms and cemeteries and memories are there
7958937 to achieve it each side will have to drop its religious argument since that of each party is exclusive of the other
7958938 canaan and the disputed territories of the west bank and gaza strip
7958939 this is exactly what i have been trying to say that one side wants a one state solution by pushing the other into the sea and it cannot be supported neither can a similar push to expel palestinians from their homeland and to keep those expelled out
7958940 whatever it may have been f cking called and whoever it might have been under

7958944 compromise lose your land and its called compromise well theres your one reason why a two state solution wont work and doesnt deserve to work compromise shove it outfield
7958945 a man with a half volition goes backwards and forwards and makes no way on the smoothest road a man with a whole volition advances on the roughest and will reach his purpose if there be even a little worthiness in it
7958946 hendak dipastikan orang yang terbaik baik setiap jawatan kerana sesungguhnya kepimpinan itu mempunyai dua rukun iaitu al quwwah dan al amanah
7958947 sesungguhnya kamu hari ini menjadi orang yang berkedudukan tinggi lagi dipercayai surah yusuf 54
7958948 apabila dua orang salah seorangnya lebih amanah dan seorang lagi lebih kuat mampu maka hendaklah didahulukan yang lebih bermanfaat untuk jawatan berkenaan dan paling kurang mudaratnya bagi jawatan tersebut maka dalam mengepalai peperangan yang kuat dan berani walaupun padanya ada kejahatan diutamakan dari lelaki yang lemah dan tidak berkemampuan walaupun dia seorang yang amanah
7958949 yang kuat dan jahat ini kerana kekuatannya untuk kepentingan orang islam kejahatannya untuk dirinya sendiri adapun yang soleh tetapi lemah maka kesolehannya untuk dirinya tetapi kelemahannya merugikan orang islam

7959009 thats nice jimmer now throw it in the trash can
7959010 if it looks like a phallic symbol someone has a strange perception
7959011 with its rounded forms and swelling of it the uppermost floors this building is very phallic
7959012 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
7959013 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
7959014 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
7959015 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
7959016 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
7959017 i am not surprised by the sale price because it is such a unique product and this is the first time in one generation that the unit has been offered for sale
7959018 i think the surest sign that there is intelligent life out there in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us
7959019 as lots stay empty they become homes for the homeless and a potential for increased crime
7959020 all that adds up to a very healthy hotel market and one of the strongest in the country
7959021 sometime this fall or early next winter youre going to see several projects start
7959022 there is a pipeline of 9 000 units of projects that are planned after this year most of which wont be built
7959023 when you are building higher end units on a locations that buyer is less apt to be concerned about short term ramifications of prices dropping 5 percent 6 percent
7959024 they know that long term great locations in a great city are irreplaceable
7959025 its in an area that will do better with a little time
7959026 the problem is later when the hoa fee goes up
7959027 some advocates say that rental gets a bad name and a bad reputation
7959028 and its especially important when you think about how these expenses in a homeownership scenario could really hurt a household so rentals not so bad
7959029 homeownership is like it or not one of the key measures of affordability
7959030 and downtown just like all other neighborhoods we want to show that we are accessible and attainable as a place to choose to purchase a home
7959031 the problem is later when the hoa fee goes up
7959032 some advocates say that rental gets a bad name and a bad reputation
7959033 and its especially important when you think about how these expenses in a homeownership scenario could really hurt a household so rentals not so bad
7959034 homeownership is like it or not one of the key measures of affordability
7959035 and downtown just like all other neighborhoods we want to show that we are accessible and attainable as a place to choose to purchase a home
7959036 i thought san diego would fall in price further and faster than it has
7959037 we intend to construct a high quality classic and distinctive high rise that will be a beautiful addition to the citys downtown skyline and to its continued economic resurgence
7959038 my thought is there is probably a better chance that irvine could go forward with a spec project just because they could pay for it in cash while probably any lender is going to want 50 percent pre leasing and that will be a difficult task at the rental rates that will be needed to justify new construction
7959039 there has been a remarkable transformation in the last several years
7959040 that transformation has been centered in residential and amenities such as the ballpark
7959041 the office sector is really the last piece of that transformation in our minds we believe it is just now getting under way our expectation is that over time there will be more interest from a wider array of companies in downtown
7959042 you have a company that is sterling doing it theyre not going to cut corners
7959043 this will be one of donald brens flagships he has a lot of them but this one has to be way up there
7959044 its definitely been a build it and they will come situation
7959045 most have visited here before and want to make the hotel del part of their real estate portfolio
7959046 endorsed by eight members of this court in rapanos the four justice plurality and the four dissenters
7959047 its about community character and the height of the building and adding density
7959048 i havent voted for any project in north university city of any size it was all approved before i was here
7959049 its dense and a lot of it is not great lets be honest some of it is not very attractive it should be more walkable
7959050 how does it look how does it affect traffic and how does it improve the community those are questions i want to ask
7959051 it is worth it to do in new york city
7959052 if you take the time to look you can find innovative ways to be energy efficient be environmental and sustainable
7959053 the concept is the same but when you make something mechanical it can break but a big block of ice four floors below grade level isnt going to do anything but melt
7959054 the idea of not only saving money for large companies but doing something that benefits the environment is win win its doing the right thing
7959055 this is for companies that want to go green but that there has to be other benefits returns on investments
7959056 it works for larger companies because their cooling costs are so considerable
7959057 this was a project agreed to a long time ago and it is what it is
7959058 if you or anyone is convinced that no active faulting exists in the north embarcadero area please provide us with proof
7959059 theres a lot of questions i have about this project
7959060 it would mean a lot to have this project start on the right foot
7959061 an economic tragedy for the south bay and san diego county
7959062 after over a year of unproductive discussions with the san diego building and construction trades council we have concluded that their unwavering unreasonable demands render the project unfeasible for our company and our shareholders
7959063 has made it clear that it will take steps to disrupt the project
7959064 but i still think people are unified that we want a major resort and conference center on the waterfront we have a great location and an amazing sense of community unity and apparently theres significant public money on the table i think we just move forward from here with or without gaylord
7959065 transform the bayfront into a magnificent world class destination experts are calling it one of the most significant waterfront planning efforts on the west coast
7959066 that probably put a million gallons into the slope and caused the landslide
7959067 everybody knows that earthquake faults exist under the nbc site
7959068 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7959069 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7959070 i love views and i was willing to forgo square footage and everything else just to get a view
7959071 had any of us known there was a basketball court here i certainly would not have bought here and i certainly would not have paid a premium
7959072 did they ask what is that circle on that park or did they assume that someone would have told them
7959073 the homeowners paid an extra 100 000 to have their homes adjacent to the park
7959074 for me this was a measure to help them get some time meaning everyone involved could see if they can work out a solution
7959075 there really isnt anything that gets you the views of the city unless you leave the city
7959076 i think like everyone else wed love to see more restaurants at the top of the buildings but they simply havent been proposed
7959077 what we want to create is more of a vertical gaslamp area
7959078 even in new york theres not the number you would expect
7959079 it doesnt take a real estate economist to say a restaurant cant compete with what an office user might pay
7959080 he said weve got to put the restaurant on the 12th floor
7959081 when we opened it the view was el cortez the original bank of america on broadway and us bank on broadway those were the three high rises
7959082 weve watched the city grow but we still have the best view
7959083 its a challenge and a risk but it worked out for us
7959084 if you compare mission hills with kensington or even what they are doing in university heights those look nice and inviting
7959085 one of the goals of the mission hills business improvement district is to turn those things around
7959086 the parking problem is bad because people who work on washington street park in the neighborhood
7959087 ive heard people say oh i wish we had a good drugstore
7959088 we knew every household and all the parents knew who all the kids were
7959089 we used to play basketball at washington elementary school after mass on sundays and it was always the same guys
7959090 ive turned down a couple of offers and have not responded back to some as well
7959091 i probably am going to buy a home in one of the ranchos whichever one is best
7959092 a large portion of why homes have gotten above a million is because of land prices and the combined fee package that is required to develop in todays environment
7959093 clearly size makes a difference are the san diego home buyers prepared to get back into compact cars and 2 000 square foot homes i dont think so personally
7959094 most people in this range have homes they need to sell before they purchase another home
7959095 in past markets it probably wasnt as strong a worry as it is today they want to make sure their other home is sold and closed before they move onto a new home
7959096 in the high end were seeing people with strong bonuses good corporate earnings very full employment
7959097 that means people can make house price purchases more easily than if there was a problem
7959098 im dealing with people who own casinos in las vegas fortune 500 companies billionaires
7959099 we get calls from germany and the hamptons but does advertising actually sell a house i dont think any of it does
7959100 that extra 1 to 2 percent is nothing compared to a 10 percent reduction in the price to get it sold
7959101 it was a lovely late afternoon early evening open house
7959102 ive been selling in rancho santa fe for 23 years and this is what ive always thought of as being the ultimate rancho santa fe property it takes your breath away
7959103 in my experience in talking to people i think they are going to go quite quickly
7959104 these are people who are going to have a very very very nice residence somewhere else and have other properties
7959105 this could be part of the portfolio of properties they own
7959106 they see this as an opportunity to purchase real estate and enjoy the benefits of that purchase
7959107 but once they understand that they have limited use of the property and once they know it has to be open to the general public for use it is easier to sell
7959108 everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which god has established the authorities that exist have been established by god consequently he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what god has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves
7959109 who am i to interfere with what god clearly says he does
7959110 who am i to ask god in all his wisdom to do something that he is not already doing
7959111 at the time i was working toward my diploma there had been a study that showed most trainers instructors who graduated only stayed with equestrian related careers for an average of three years
7959112 how then do you stay so avidly interested in teaching and training after 20 years
7959113 i dont know anything about the training of these horses so ill go find someone who is an expert who can educate me
7959114 equestraining has elements of endurance riding dressage fox hunting three day pleasure riding trail riding and arena exercises
7959115 you end up with a horse that is not only physically developed but is also mentally a fully developed athlete because his mind is kept so active with new and interesting activities
7959116 a person such as you describe can limit herself so much because she never expands her mind by asking questions
7959117 my goal with horses and with my life is to ask questions and be one who is constantly open to new ideas and new teachings no matter my age
7959118 at this point were not really sure what impact it will have on redevelopment
7959119 that would degrade existing public services and facilities below acceptable standards
7959120 the reason we continue to fight this battle is because we believe very strongly we have a chance of winning
7959121 we decided questions needed to be asked about what was the best use of the property at this time and the future of san diego
7959122 i think they do not have san diegos best interests at heart
7959123 they are really trying not only to stop just me but also the united states navy and the productive development of the western edge of our city
7959124 the average tenant in downtown san diego occupies 5 000 square feet with 30 percent of the market made up of users of 2 500 square feet or less
7959125 lease rates in san diego have gone up and with interest rates at their current level the lines between leasing and owning have been blurred there are a lot of small business owners who would rather put their money into a mortgage instead of rent
7959126 we have created flexibility for buyers to pick the size of their space based on needs
7959127 the beauty of owning your space is the complete flexibility it affords a business owner
7959128 we provide the most national and international exposure for new condo developments of any web site in the world
7959129 we are proud to take the first large step in building our local network we feel this alliance will provide greater local exposure for our clients in these four markets we plan to roll out additional cities throughout the year
7959130 we chose these four cities to start with because these are four of the ten largest markets on our web site and we have a large control of the market in these areas
7959131 we are confident that this relationship will boost local exposure for our clients and add an incredible amount of value to our clients campaigns
7959132 but at the same time if youre a neighbor and suddenly get a public notice for something already under construction what would you say
7959133 they say theyre building apartments but theyre really building condos so that we dont get to see them until after the condominiums are built
7959134 i understand that the community planning groups are frustrated that they dont get a chance to provide input but its already been approved so they feel like theyve been circumvented
7959135 the reason thats done is because the process takes months and months
7959136 it really has no meaningful impact to the community whatsoever because its not at all circumventing
7959137 through partnerships with major marketing companies and developers our goal is to bridge the gap between condo sellers and condo buyers we offer the user information and links about various condo developments in san francisco and we offer the builder a perfect platform for marketing their projects and accelerating the sales momentum
7959138 i havent seen the concept be successful except in the very best of locations
7959139 are telling us that it is probably better to run it as a hotel
7959140 development is a very tricky bizarre business and frankly developers are not the nicest of people
7959141 it really took a cowboy and entrepreneur like rebeil i dont think any of this would have happened without him
7959142 this is a beautiful area that i have enjoyed since the first time i visited my son in oceanside the beautiful lagoon and bird sanctuary cannot be replaced once destroyed or altered there is so little of this habitat left please help to preserve this beautiful lagoon so that it can be enjoyed by everyone who lives in the area and by those that visit your beautiful state
7959143 which do you like better the book or the movie adaptation
7959144 do you believe in a 7 literal day creation as accounted in genesis
7959145 and the evening and the morning were the first day
7959146 parents only have to worry about money life is easier for them i cannot wait for that stage of life
7959147 americas competitors around the world are implementing comprehensive broadband plans countries like japan korea and canada have left us far behind this is unacceptable broadband is our central infrastructure challenge high capacity networks are to the twenty first century what roads canals and railroads were to the nineteenth and highways and basic telecommunications were to the twentieth our economy and our future will be driven by how quickly and completely we deploy broadband that is why congress charged the fcc with promoting broadband deployment for all americans whether they live in rural areas inner cities or tribal lands whether they are affluent or of limited income whether they live with or without disabilities recently we heard an announcement from the very top of our government that our goal is universal broadband access by 2007 but we are not making acceptable progress toward that goal yes there are good stories in these glossy pages schools and libraries enjoy broadband access like never before new technologies offer new promise strides are being made in some rural communities companies are working hard still one glaring fact stands out the united states is ranked eleventh in the world in broadband penetration note weve fallen to 15th in the interim this report somehow finds that this is acceptable and that our efforts are resulting in timely deployment
7959148 what we usually see is both a weekly trend and a seasonal trend in std and pregnancy testing for example mondays are always the day we get lots of requests for plan b we see a huge rise in pregnancy and std testing and more telling than the number of tests the number of positive results
7959149 first and middle name its gonna happen again if you dont put some shoes on
7959150 mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith
7959151 miss smith oh i had not observed you are extremely obliging and if i were not an old married but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me anything else i should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over
7959152 that is an amazing guy i would want a guy to do that for me or a friend of mine if we had been so snubbed by a mr elton
7959153 she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all
7959154 then i know i need not be uneasy three things very dull indeed that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as so as ever i open my mouth shant i
7959155 ah maam but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
7959156 ah well to be sure yes i see what she means
7959157 emma how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent to a woman of her character age and situation i had not thought it possible
7959158 how could i help saying it i dare say she did not understand me
7959159 i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candor and generosity i wish you could have heard her honoring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was forever receiving from yourself when her society must be so irksome
7959160 i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow there is some of the ridiculous in her
7959161 were she a woman of fortune i would leave every little absurdity to take its chance but she is poor and should she live to be an old woman she will sink further still her situation deserves your compassion badly done emma badly done she has watched you grow from a time when her notice was a thing of honor to this this is not pleasant for you emma and it is very far from pleasant for me but i must tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will sometime do me greater justice than you do now
7959162 i will not tolerate those who slander my neighbors i will not endure conceit and pride
7959163 what do i care i love her she doesnt return my affections so why should i make a comment about her behavior
7959164 mad mak olay geldi bir an akl ma ba ka yazarlar vard gerginlik olabilirdi sessizce yerimden kalkt m ve hemen karab k terk ettim
7959165 embraces a vision of the kingdom of god and combines prayer with social transformation
7959166 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
7959167 people are just totally shocked that the city council approved it
7959168 they didnt seem to understand the health risks that come with placing residents in an industrial zone
7959169 they certainly have talked about a referendum and thats their right
7959170 but we would urge them not to take that step because of the strong merits of the project and the obvious misconceptions their opposition is based on
7959171 the more you talk to local residents outside the political world of san marcos the more you see they are appalled at this idea
7959172 we basically ask voters to say the city did the wrong thing
7959173 if we do a referendum the voters get a chance to tell the council youve got to be kidding
7959174 the main hurdle is getting the message to the voters
7959175 the only way to pull it off is to have a very motivated electorate and it has to be something people care about citywide
7959176 everyone has opinions about wal mart even if they lived far away from the site but im not sure there is the same public outrage toward this project
7959177 jantje ga eens mooi speulen paps en mams willen ook tijd voor zichzelf
7959178 we arent one of the great waterfronts in the world but we could be
7959179 i basically salute anybody who is willing to step out and better the overall waterfront
7959180 era tutto cos lontano dice commossa la vezzali faccio scherma per passione se sono qui grazie ai sacrifici e alla mia famiglia
7959181 il mio sport il mio lavoro ma anche il mio sogno non ci credo ancora ma sognando tanto i sogni si avverano spiega un incredulo minguzzi contro fodor stata durissima ma ho stretto i denti perch questo sport cos ero in formissima e con i sacrifici arrivano i risultati
7959182 e un gesto antisportivo e ingiusto rovina la mia festa mi dispiace perch lui un grande campione
7959183 sui quattrocento non sono riuscita ad esprimermi ma oggi ho ascoltato le indicazioni del mio allenatore e sono andata in vasca seguendo solo il mio istinto
7959184 quando sono cos in forma non mi batte nemmeno superman
7959185 dedico questa medaglia soprattutto a me stesso perch in questo sport fai tutto da solo quando prendi le botte e quando le dai il momento pi bello cantare linno sul podio unemozione fortissima ha dichiarato il pugile italiano e poi voglio dedicare questo oro a tutti quelli che soffrono anche se non spetta a me cercare di migliorare la situazione mica posso prendere tutti a pugni ad solo
7959186 impressive shoulders and steely jaw that draw jealous stares from his gop colleagues
7959187 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun
7959188 external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7959189 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalised in ecclesiastical life
7959190 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7959191 embraces a vision of the kingdom of god and combines prayer with social transformation
7959192 hey the clouds moving blow the trumpets were moving out
7959193 converters time the market theyll put their application in and wait until the market is favorable
7959194 so when costs go back up many more than 1 000 units worth could be built in a one year period
7959195 at the end of the day we determined the cap was not statistically significant
7959196 the number of units impacted by the cap is relatively small
7959197 a relatively small percentage of the remaining potential inventory is the only subset subject to this cap
7959198 its a shame that after nearly two years of talking about this issue the citys leaders still dont understand the significance of stopping condo conversions
7959199 we know that we cant stop whats already in the pipeline were concerned about the next wave
7959200 this idea of a cap we put out in december 2005
7959201 if the city had actually engaged us on the issue instead of pretending that it didnt exist we might have had a cap in place a year ago or even more and then the projects currently in the pipeline we would be doing something about them but the city has done this kicking and screaming because the development interests tell the leaders what to do
7959202 why dont you just get up and start work at 8 a m and work for eight hours
7959203 why dont you just add up how long it takes you to get ready to go out
7959204 i guess we never taught you to manage your finances
7959205 weve done our best to create the next great mmorpg experience but its the fans that will bring our world to life
7959206 the day of reckoning approaches and its going to be glorious its time to go to war
7959207 there are so many of these houses that have the potential to be reborn
7959208 one of the things that stood out was the ultimate re use of an existing home the architects created a wonderful modern living environment without sacrificing or destroying a vintage california ranch home there was no need to build an opulent oversized structure
7959209 when they say they cant do affordable housing thats complete
7959210 i find it very interesting that citymark gave the title of doma to a condo development it couldnt be a better name for a home
7959211 i guess we didnt check the russian dictionary at least it wasnt offensive
7959212 ik ben dwars door luik gefietst zonder een gerede kans door een auto te worden doodgereden dat was 15 jaar geleden wel anders en wat een leuke stad is dat niks niet lelijk zoals die elkaar napratende volkskrantlezertjes nederlanders op doorreis naar het zonnige zuiden beweren volgende verrassing tussen luik en maastricht pal naast de maas fietsen over haventerreinen afbrokkelende kades onder reusachtige werkende en stofwolken uithoestende overslaginstallaties door langs uitgestrekte verwilderde vlaktes een botenkerkhof kalksteenbergen fabrieken kranen een machtig industrieel decor kortom
7959213 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england my manager has told me that i am not going for trials but for medical tests and if i pass i will be playing for fulham this season
7959214 i love fulham football club and i want to stay here and play for fulham
7959215 i feel that we didnt perform well at hull we repaired that in a way against arsenal and it was a big three points but really it is all about consistency
7959216 we face a cup tie now and it is no good getting carried away after that we are not playing for nearly three weeks because it was supposed to be manchester united this weekend but they are in the european super cup on friday in monaco
7959217 and we dont want to sit it out all that time thinking our last performance was a poor one against a team from a lower division
7959218 what do you do when the person on the inside doesnt match the person on the outside how do i become genuine

7959223 menaka this place gets a hard on when youre here you look gorgeous meet my friend varun the dancer extraordinaire
7959224 its a pleasure meeting you and you must know i have a thing for dancers winks
7959225 not really a trained dancer but invisible dancing shoes have a thing for me when i see beautiful women like you and my feet itch to dance
7959226 lady swing you hips along with mine it lends a deep flavor to this dance
7959227 a lot of things are swinging in your favor least of all the flavor
7959228 theres nothing wrong in burying the gun taking up the gauntlet and shooting other arrows age is never a barrier for breaking free and seeking true companionship
7959229 if in any portion of it or to any extent it presents facts sufficent to constitute a cause of action the pleading will stand
7959230 theres a number of witness es to be interviewed there was a number at the scene
7959231 were not releasing any de tails about the investigation that may affect the results of the investigation
7959232 i heard a scream last night but i didnt pay much attention to it to tell you the truth
7959233 youre camping somewhere you dont expect to run into problems like that but drinking drugs and partying and boom drugs do a lot of fun ny things to people
7959234 theres chickens and roost ers back there so we thought it might have been that but then we heard the ambulance and all the sirens going my heart was pounding
7959235 there was a lot of excitement going around here last night
7959236 this is really a nice campground with the most fan tastic people you can meet its not a place where you find a racket like this this is what shocks me its very difficult to believe its kind of a jolt to your system but things happen ev ery day
7959237 these things never bother me why should i be afraid for i know them for years its a nor mal day for me

7959246 i really identified with your transparency post my first child had colic and i had ppd it took me so long to truly bond with her i loved her because i was her mother and i knew i should but there was a huge part of me that resented her for changing my life in ways i never could have imagined motherhood at that time was not at all what i expected and it wasnt until i joined a mothers center that i realized that for many moms reality is much different than the expectations since so many moms are away from their family support systems i think moms groups are life savers i know i have become a much better mom a much more confident mom due to the support i have had from the moms i have met i truly wish all moms could find the support i have been able to i am so happy to say also that i am as bonded with my daughter as you could possibly be now in fact she will be heading to kindergarten and my heart is breaking she is truly my best little buddy and sending her off to the unknown is so nerve wracking and yet i feel like i will learn a whole new side of her as she embarks on her new journey tears tears thanks for posts like the transparency one all moms need to know that they arent alone in their feelings that we all have moments where we question our abilities and feel alone or lacking theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone

7959297 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan

7959307 voor het eerst sinds 2001 is de papaverteelt in afghanistan licht gedaald
7959308 er is dit jaar een duidelijker verband tussen papaverteelt en de strijd van de talibaan dat blijkt uit het jaarlijkse rapport van de vn
7959309 de productiedaling is het resultaat van gioed provinciaal bestuur en van de huidige droogte die heeft geleid tot hogere tarweprijzen terwijl de prijs van opium is gedaald door de hoge productie
7959310 de vernietiging van papaver was niet effectief maar wel erg duur in termen van mensenlevens
7959311 terwijl het waar is dat karzais vijanden de taliban zich financieren door de drugshandel doen veel van zijn medestanders hetzelfde de moeilijkheid is dat het onwaarschijnlijk is dat de strijd ophoudt zolang de taliban zichzelf kunnen financieren door drugs en zolang de regering in kaboel afhankelijk is van opium om hun greep op de macht te handhaven

7959382 you only wish laughs that in any case is the intention this is a trompe loeil the tyranny of artistic deception it is a painting on the wall that makes the image as real as possible it lends a deceptive illusory 3d effect to what is really only a 2d painting

7959408 us giving you this card is but another step in the support youve always given the association
7959409 wearing this shirt was and will always be a privilege for any football player
7959410 the teams comeback on sunday was another example of the drive pride and hard work a footbal player needs and watching it filled us with nostalgia and satisfaction todays act will help us continue to instill the clubs values on the new players that arrive on the team this is an added responsibility captains have and it should be transmitted from each generation on you are the living image of this club and together we will continue to grow
7959411 it is an honour for us to be part of this association and to continue to instill the values weve learned from you
7959412 we feel proud of matches like the one on sunday because this is the real madrid side everyone wants to see you have us and the entire squad at your disposal for whatever you may need
7959413 i want to congratulate the four captains for being here today and the association for having this gesture towards them
7959414 i dont like to talk about former players because i believe a real madrid player continues to be so until the day he dies our wish is for all our players to be part of the veterans association one day this board strives to give the veterans its support because they are the essence of the club those who wish to learn what the association does learn what this club has been through them
7959415 we want to have a place in the future where former players that need a place to stay may spend their last days of their lives it will be fantastic for those who join the youth system residency to watch the kids run and enjoy what real madrid city has to offer
7959416 it isnt easy to play for this club it is a privilege very few have youve been very successful here sundays comeback was exceptional but actually rather normal in real madrid history it filled us with satisfaction to see the players react that way when they were losing real madrid would be able to win with just four men if that were allowed

7959474 con este acto queremos que los deportistas paral mpicos de navarra tengan el apoyo de nuestras asociaciones de nuestra sociedad y tambi n de las familias
7959475 el segundo evento multideportivo m s importante despu s de los juegos ol mpicos
7959476 este a o se ha creado un plan de apoyo a los deportistas paral mpicos similar al ado que tan buenos resultados est dando y que pone de manifiesto que siempre que se invierte en deporte los resultados son importantes
7959477 consiste en que una empresa local esponsoriza a un deportista de su tierra
7959478 tenemos que seguir intentando que las empresas apoyen a estos deportistas porque los deportistas paral mpicos se esfuerzan much simo al igual que el resto pero tienen menos reconocimiento p blico que el resto
7959479 a veces el deporte paral mpico no tiene el reconocimiento que merece pero hay much simas personas que trabajan duro y obtienen unos resultados extraordinarios
7959480 un exemplo de esforzo e superaci n no que se mira moita xente nova

7959665 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
7959666 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it we will have to see what other issues were present
7959667 so exactly how do you want to play this frost the balls in your court
7959668 what i would really like to do now that we have cross referenced our lists and we know for the most part who is on the take we should leak some misinformation about the case assignment
7959669 yeah he would kind of hate it if something happened to me so he makes sure that it doesnt hes very good at his job too max has saved my life countless numbers of times
7959670 i want you to get on the horn and make it known that we have an indictment coming down for mikey already old news then i want you to spread the word that the case has been assigned to judge montgomerys docket make sure it is known that everything is being expedited and that montgomery is probably not even going to require an appearance from campinieri
7959671 hello steve j j here yeah i got a case for you
7959672 the boss says he has a case for montgomery in re mikey campinieri et al can you add it to the docket
7959673 yeah i can do that montgomery has taken campinieris cases before they never seem to amount to much of anything any chance that well get something this time
7959674 no idea gladys but what i do know is that this one is really really big afraid i cant say much more ill get the files over to you as soon as the boss releases them
7959675 ok lo thanks lets do lunch tomorrow its been a while we need to catch up
7959676 sure thing gladys silver diner at 11 30 sound ok
7959677 sounds just fab see you then ill be looking for those files ciao
7959678 we couldnt wander into better luck weve owned montgomery for years tell the legal team to stand down we wont need to do anything except make a nice showing
7959679 i recommend that we at the very least make a nice showing remember this is darin frost that were dealing with here he has a way of turning the tide on us
7959680 j j good to hear from you seems i only get a call from you these days when you have a hot one for me these other piddly little cases ive been getting are for the birds so what do you have wish i could have that campinieri case i d like to blow that guy out of the water but im glancing at the schedule here and see that you already gave that baby to that slime montgomery
7959681 well just between you and me steve that what the docket says and thats what we want the docket to say until showtime
7959682 thats exactly right steve but we need to keep this on the qt it has to stay under wraps thats why im calling your cell and not the office phone ill be delivering the files to your office myself well have a courier bring some dummy files over to montgomerys office easy enough to do because we know hell never open them past the first couple of pages anyway
7959683 gotcha ill book my courtroom for the same time as montgomery has his scheduled but ill leave the case name blank nobody will be the wiser ill nail his tail the wall
7959684 well lets just make sure we stay within the confines of the law hmmmm
7959685 look mr levine ive been working for you for a long time doing a god job too or id be outta here for sure you the detective max and i know that montgomery is the scum of the earth there is no way this side of eternity hes getting a campinieri case unless you and the detective here are now on the take and id be willing to bet my salvation against that one
7959686 we know that these phones are probably bugged and we just want to lead mikey down his desired path he wont even be able to imagine how wrong he is until its too late can you make up a dummy copy of the files make the first 5 or 10 pages authentic the rest can just be paper theyll never read them anyway then have the courier deliver the fake set to montgomerys office well handle the rest for now the less you know the better but by this time tomorrow you and the rest of new york will know it all
7959687 you got it detective i think im going to quite enjoy this i just cant wait to see what you have planned

7959741 my boyfriend and i have been dating about 1 yr and a half now but throughout the relationship i would find little traces of his ex gf still every few months ill find out that he still keeps memories of her the worst that made me really angry was when i found out that he still kept her text message which was sent by her almost 2 yrs back in the text message she was asking him if he was over her he claimed to have never replied her i know people may say that theres nothing wrong in being friends with their ex es but theyre not even friends or contacting each other anymore i just felt like by keeping all the memories of her tells me that hes not completely over her yet and i feel like this 1 yr plus of relationship with me has been a waste of time his bestfriend tells me that hell always have feelings for her and its hurting me when i asked him if its true he swore to me saying its not true at all and that im the only one he loves but his actions are telling me otherwise i dont know what to do anymore stephanie

7959745 communication is best achieved through simple planning and control to become an effective communicator you must learn to listen as well as to speak those who dismiss this as a mere platitude are already demonstrating an indisposition to listening the phrase may be trite but the message is hugely significant to your effectiveness as a communicator if you do not explicitly develop the skill of listening you may not hear the suggestion information which should launch you to fame and fortune
7959746 there are two ways of phrasing any question one way the closed question is likely to lead to a simple grunt in reply yes no maybe the second way the open question will hand over the speaking role to someone else and force them to say something a little more informative
7959747 suppose you conduct a review of a recently finished project with gretchen and it goes something like this

7959750 bloom argues that if university classes do not call for undergraduate or graduate students to develop the higher level cognitive skills then the students have not received a higher education course expectations that require you to use higher level cognitive skills are of course more difficult but if you are only being tested for recognition and recall then you may never develop higher order intellectual skills thus for example a professor who tells you beforehand exactly what you should know for example for a test is in effect telling you what you can afford to ignore in what he she was trying to teach you this would be the equivalent of going to someone to teach you how to hit a baseball who told you ahead of each pitch exactly what kind of pitch he was going to give you youd think that you were a really great hitter based on this until you got into an actual game where the pitcher didnt tell you beforehand what he was going to send your way life is a little bit like that pitcher sending curves sliders fastballs and even screwballs your way a proper higher education will help you deal with all of those pitches and situations

7959833 people ask did i play a role in the selection of joe biden as running mate absolutely not
7959834 my boyfriend and i have been dating for 3 years and last year he joined the navy i never knew that was his calling so now i have myself a long distance relationship but thats not even the worst of my problems i recently found out that i was somewhat of the rebound girl some 3 years ago this girl i cant stand she asked me for advice on how to get back with my bf after he had broken up with her he stopped talking to the ex for a good year while we were dating the second year however they started talking again my boyfriend and i are very close and really have never had a fight over anything but the ex we talk on a weekly basis now that hes gone but when he comes back when we arent hanging out hes with the ex he says theyre just friends but i know she is not over him and probably never will be she uses the fact that they hang out to try and make me jealous its starting to piss me off because he doesnt understand that she is driving me crazy he says hes sorry she acts that way but she is still one of his close friends what do you suggest i do or what can i say to him without coming off as the jealous girlfriend
7959835 i have been dateing this guy for 9 months now
7959836 my boyfriend and i have been dating for a little over 2 months now so obviously everything is still new i didnt find out how badly he had been hurt by his previous relationship until about two weeks ago
7959837 i recently met a guy on match we are totally compatible and were getting along great i noticed a few weeks in that he was being distant i didnt say anything we are still casually dating at this point one night at dinner he tells me his ex girlfriend of 5 years who was deployed to the middle east for an unknown amount of time is now coming back into town for the summer she will be leaving again after that he said he cant get involved with me because he isnt emotionally available although he thought she was gone for good they did have a big bad break up and he still loves her i dont get it she left and they ended their relationship what is the deal here
7959838 my boyfriend and i started dating 6 weeks after his wife of 13 years left him for another man
7959839 i have been w my husband for just over 4 yrs now we have a 3 yr old son and i am 7 months pergnant
7959840 okay so i think i kinda like this guy but im not sure if he likes me i just met at my part time job about a month ago he is very nice and says hi to me all the time we actually talk a whole lot and seem to have a lot in common we like the same bands and foods sometimes he talks about random nonsense just to talk to me or at least i think that is the reason im not exactly sure if he is flirting or not one time we were talking and he asked where was my boyfriend it seemed like he was asking in a joking way so i didnt really know what to think i kinda just brushed it off but i do still wonder if he was serious what do you think does he like me or not maybe i should just send him a note and ask him to circle one lol

7959845 ive been speaking and writing for over 18 years but learned mostly by trial and error after working with rob eagar however i learned more in a few months than i had learned in years my confidence and professionalism quickly improved and the feedback that i receive now is better than ever through robs help i discovered how to create keynote talks that fulfill leaders goals and generate referrals cut my message preparation time in half and work more efficiently drive more traffic to my website network with other speakers to increase speaking engagements and product awareness rob had answers to questions that id been wrestling with for a long time he is a wealth of industry knowledge and advice i recommend his services to speakers and writers at any level

7959894 our nation that i love is like a great giant that can deal with a problem when it focuses on it
7959895 but it seems like that giant of a nation is like a cyclops with but one eye that can focus only on one problem at a time

7959940 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7959941 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7959942 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7959943 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7959944 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7959945 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7959946 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7959947 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7959948 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case

7959955 then as so often happens just as i am ready to start writing knowing pretty much what i want to say and excited about finding a way to say it well something in me tries to get up and leave it drink a glass of water look out the window read a magazine just as the spell has a chance of working i break it just as there is a chance of bringing light out of dark i choose the dark withdraw my hand from the hand i have reached out for

7959967 w hen we read the bible we are not necessarily reading the bible as scripture at one level this is the experience of many ordinary christians who take up the bible and read its words then walk away unchanged uninspired and uncertain this is the word of god what does it mean who can make sense of these words i t is no less true that the seminary trained and the scholar share the common experience of dryness in the journey through the pages of the bible in fact for those apprenticed in the ways of biblical scholarship during the last two centuries the experience of distance between ancient text and faithful life is often even more pronounced

7959977 this would be consistent with reports that israel may have helped iran develop nuclear weapons
7959978 the iranian presidents extremist statements proved to everyone that iran of today is an iran that is impossible to live with ahmadinejad unites the entire world against iran
7959979 i hope average israelis see how they are being used as pawns as the jews of europe were with fatal consequences
