1200000 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
1200001 god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
1200002 therefore my brothers be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will never fall
1200003 i pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in christ
1200004 be faithful even to the point of death and i will give you the crown of life
1200005 to him who overcomes and does my will to the end i will give authority over the nations
1200006 god will give to each person according to what he has done to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life
1200007 to the pure all things are pure but to those who are corrupted and do not believe nothing is pure in fact both their minds and consciences are corrupted they claim to know god but by their actions they deny him they are detestable disobedient and unfit for doing anything good
1200008 whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for god s wrath remains on him
1200009 if anyone does not love the lord a curse be on him
1200010 but if even we or an angel from heaven preaches a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned as we have already said so now i say it again if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than what you accepted let him be eternally condemned
1200011 the lord said to me jeremiah from the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land i am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms declared the lord their kings will come and setup their thrones in the entrance of the gates of jerusalem they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of judah i will pronounce my judgment on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made
1200012 but they were unfaithful to the god of their fathers so the god of israel stirred up the spirit of plu king of assyria who took the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh into exile where they are to this day
1200013 i will hand all judah over to the king of babylon who will carry them away to babylon or put them to the sword i will hand over to their enemies all the wealth of this city all its products all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of judah they will take it away as plunder and carry it away to babylon
1200014 therefore the lord almighty said this because you have not listened to my words i will summon all the people of the north and my servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon declared the lord and i will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations i will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn and an everlasting ruin
1200015 then isaiah said to hezekiah hear the word of the lord almighty the time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to babylon nothing will be left said the lord and some of your descendants your own flesh and blood who will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon
1200016 woe to you who are complacent on mount zion and you who feel secure on mount samaria
1200017 i abhor the pride of jacob and detest his fortresses i will deliver up the city and everything in it
1200018 that was how god acted toward them in the old testament because grace had not yet been implemented
1200019 jesus christ god is the same yesterday and today and forever
1200020 how could a god of love be behind such an atrocious deed
1200021 do not worship any other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god
1200022 the lord is a jealous and avenging god the lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath
1200023 let no debt remain outstanding except the continued debt to love one another for he who loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law
1200024 in his prime no contest he can beat kobe bryant
1200025 in his prime no contest he can beat kobe bryant
1200026 in his prime no contest he can beat kobe bryant
1200027 so i know something is bothering you i can tell because you only smoke cigarettes when something is bothering you
1200028 youre right something is quite alot in fact its this feeling its something that ive felt before and it only brought me problems you know and its its not like you know the common feelings like love or happiness or anger its one that i cant explain a feeling with no name no origin its not from the heart
1200029 really well whats its like when did it first start
1200030 along time ago all because of this one girl with very different ideas
1200031 and i remember thinking that it would never work and that i didnt think anyone would approve of my feeling so i shunned it down and held it in a friend of mine asked me about it and was surprised that i was going to forget about it he said thats not the pete i know the one i know would do something about it at least tell her something well anyway i did and it sorta backfired on me and i made this stupid excuse that i was drunk and didnt mean it you know to avoid the humiliation of rejection so time passed and this feeling i gave it away to my friend and he used it and shared it with this girl that i had known
1200032 haha yeah anyway i guess he thought i didnt like it which i really kinda didnt but i mean i still wanted to be friends and i guess he thought i hated him so he just never spoke to me again and i slowly forgot about him summer came and with it it brought my taboo weed
1200033 and well weed opened this experience pool to me i felt saw heard and said things that you would only say once in a lifetime or i guess only if you were high haha and i started getting high with that one person and somehow someway that feeling found its way back into me and i hate myself for letting it
1200034 why i mean it sounds like a nice feeling haha
1200035 oh trust me it is but i i well i just didnt want it i didnt think i should feel it or that deserved or needed it
1200036 because its a feeling that is meant to be shared and only works when both people have it at the same time i guess you could say its its like the thing before love if love comes after this then thats great but if it doesnt well its kinda like a second or third or fourth chance to try to find it again depending on how much it takes you
1200037 so this feeling i guess its like a hallway and at the end theres like alot of doors
1200038 yeah exactly you go into one and its a horrible future so you walk out of it and it wont be easy but you make it out and try the next door and you know with he sighs with this feeling as with everything else you ever do theres doubt because its impossible to know its impossible to know how this person feels
1200039 but i mean since the last time youve had alot more time to get to know each other and junk
1200040 well i guess i feel like it could be but see in my case im stuck in this spider web with two decisions to make either one is good and either one is bad
1200041 well lets say i choose one right if it backfires the other one wont be an option anymore because theyll feel like a rebound or something so its win win or lose lose
1200042 it is but see at the same time its not because you know when youre with these people and the feeling is there you dont ever think about the negatives at least i dont see because some people might ask well you dont to spend the rest of your life wondering what if do you you know id rather spend my life like that then to spend it knowing that it wasnt possible and i had no chance in hell
1200043 and some people think well why make such a big deal or something little because i hate dullness and i hate simplicity feelings and thought are the most wonderful and important things you can do with your life so why not make them complex and interesting you could just say oh okay i like this person alot no no its not like that alot cause you can like alot of people its more like i feel like if me and you were together we would have these moments with each other that would just be amazing and wed see things and feel things that no one would understand unless they were us but remember its not love true love is the decision that you could spen the rest of your life this person thats long after this feeling
1200044 so basically youre explaining to me in a more complex way what dating is
1200045 haha yeah i guess i am but well thats whereim at right now i want to test my theory out
1200046 so you feel like maybe in the future you could love this person
1200047 i pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of all the good things we have in christ
1200048 the trap of the devil who has taken them captive to do his will
1200049 do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for everything in the world the cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has or does comes not from the father but from the world the world and its desires pass away but the man who does the will of god lives forever
1200050 you adulterous people don t you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward god anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god
1200051 therefore go and make disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
1200052 do nothing out of selfish ambitions or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
1200053 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he can not be my disciple
1200054 im a nikehead i wear chains that excite the feds
1200055 you say i am rich i have acquired wealth and do not need a thing
1200056 and i will call her the nation of israel my loved one who is not my loved one
1200057 what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase by no means we died to sin how can we live in it any longer
1200058 the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
1200059 since what may be known about god is plain to them jews because god has made it plain to them
1200060 for although they jews knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him romans 1 22 although they jews claimed to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god only israelites knew the glory of god for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles
1200061 although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death
1200062 you therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself
1200063 now you if you call yourself a jew if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to god if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law
1200064 you who brag about the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law as it is written gods name is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you
1200065 what shall we conclude then are we jews any better not at all we have already made the charge that jews and gentiles alike are all under sin
1200066 for when we all jews were notice this is past tense controlled by the sinful nature the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies so that we bore fruit for death
1200067 for before the law was given sin was in the world but sin is not taken into account when there is no law
1200068 dont confuse me with the facts i have had my mind made up for years as to what paul was saying in chapter seven
1200069 a hebrew of hebrews in regard to the law a pharisee as for zeal persecuting the church as for legalistic righteousness faultless
1200070 follow my example as i follow the example of christ
1200071 for you yourself know how you ought to follow our example
1200072 we did this not because we do not have the right to such help but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow
1200073 for god did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life
1200074 whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me put it into practice
1200075 if paul was a wretched sinner as a redeemed man should i be expected to live any better
1200076 the law was made for bad guys but no matter how bad a person is he is not so bad that christ cant show him mercy
1200077 of whom i am the worst but for that very reason i was past tense shown mercy so that in me the worst of sinners christ jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life
1200078 christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am the worst chief
1200079 but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me the worst of sinners christ jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life
1200080 however it is written no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him but god has revealed it to us by his spirit
1200081 depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
1200082 this will happen when the lord jesus christ is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels
1200083 are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation
1200084 when she rhoda recognized peters voice she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed peter is at the door you re out of your mind they told her when she kept insisting that it was so they said it must be his angel
1200085 the first one came and said sir your mina has earned ten more well done my good servant his master replied because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter take charge of ten cities the second came and said sir your mina has earned five more his master answered you take charge of five cities
1200086 but in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth the home of righteousness
1200087 then i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away
1200088 jesus answered them is it not written in you law i have said you are gods
1200089 at the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven
1200090 why wasn t this information give to us in the bible
1200091 he who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the universe
1200092 paul and barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly of the lord who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous sign and wonders
1200093 god did extraordinary miracles through paul handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them
1200094 never will i leave you never will i forsake you
1200095 then the disciples came to jesus in private and asked why couldn t we drive it out he replied because you have so little faith i tell you the truth if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you
1200096 if it wasnt for the instant pontiac payday loan payday loan info that i got from your website i dont pontiac payday loan know what
1200097 do you do what you do and live the way you preach with the motive of eternal life
1200098 if the bible didnt give you and people like you the fear of hell fire would any one be
1200099 the second motive is that i know it is the correct way to live disregarding heaven or hell many times it is difficult but at the end it is always rewarding
1200100 abstain from those works and affairs which hinder the worship to be rendered to god the joy proper to the lords day or the suitable relaxation of mind and body
1200101 to call people from among the gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith
1200102 god will give to each person according to what he has done to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life
1200103 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i will be with you always to the very end of the age
1200104 i pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of ever good thing we have in christ
1200105 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
1200106 so if you think you are standing firm be careful that you do not fall
1200107 therefore my brothers be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will never fall and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ
1200108 we want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end in order to make your hope sure we do not want you to become lazy but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what was promised
1200109 therefore dear friends since you already know this be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord jesus christ
1200110 and once made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him
1200111 make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy without holiness no one will see the lord
1200112 anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god
1200113 anyone who knows the good he ought to do and doesn t do it sins
1200114 a twitter profile has started lending links with lures to a pornographic video of brazilian pop star kelly key if you click on the link you get a window that shows the progress of an automatic download of a so called new version of adobe flash which is supposedly required to watch the video you end up with a file labeled adobe flash it s a fake on your machine in reality this is a trojan downloader that proceeds to download 10 bankers password theft malware onto the infected machine all of which are disguised as mp3 files
1200115 the devil led him up a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world and he said to him i will give you all their authority and splendor because it has been given to me and i can give it to anyone i want so if you worship me it will all be yours jesus answered it is written worship the lord your god and serve him only
1200116 the earth is the lord s and everything in it
1200117 and i ll say to myself you have plenty of good things laid up for many years his wealth gave him the freedom to take life easy eat drink and be merry but god said to him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get what you have prepared for yourself this is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward god
1200118 you cannot serve both god and money what is highly valued among men is detestable in god s sight
1200119 look at all i am doing for the cause of christ with his money
1200120 as he looked up jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury he also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins i tell you the truth he said this poor widow has put in more than all the others all these people gave their gifts out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on
1200121 live as free men but do not use your freedom as a cover up for evil
1200122 they are godless men who change the grace of god into a license for immorality and deny jesus christ our sovereign and lord
1200123 then he said to them watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed a man s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions

1200126 its a national disgrace that these magnificent animals are still hunted at all and that they are so cruelly treated when brought ashore
1200127 fishermen bring the creatures ashore with their flippers pierced and tied with straw they are routinely dragged on to boat ramps and turned on their backs and left to suffer for days in the hot sun
1200128 i have seen children jumping on and torturing the helpless animals and i have seen them dragged away attached to the back of trucks

1200142 theyre getting the copper and the aluminum out of the air handling units package units that are up on the roof
1200143 everybody just leaves the door open and the air will filter through the building it will not be as cool as you probably like it but it will be cooler
1200144 they may get ten dollars worth of copper and tear up a ten thousand dollar machine were probably well over a half million dollars in damages

1200162 i dont understand how there can be such a discrepancy
1200163 i am a mother if i thought for a second that a child would get sick i wouldnt be doing this you try your very best because you are feeding babies and children
1200164 che si dice a chi molto insistente e deriva dal modo di caccia di questo rapace si aggancia con gli artigli alla schiena della preda e la becchetta sulla testa finch non la finisce
1200165 do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize run in such a way as to get the prize
1200166 no i beat my body and make it my slave so that after i have preached to others i myself will not be disqualified for the prize
1200167 i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus
1200168 do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize
1200169 everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training they will get a crown that will not last but we get a crown that will last forever
1200170 no one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs he wants to please his commanding officer similarly if anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victors crown unless he completes according to the rules
1200171 now there is in store for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only me but also to all who long for his appearing
1200172 blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him
1200173 and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away
1200174 be faithful even to the point of death and i will give you the crown of life
1200175 i am coming soon hold on to what you have so that no one will take your crown
1200176 therefore my brothers you whom i love and long for my joy and crown that is how you should stand firm in the lord dear friends
1200177 for what is our hope our joy or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of the lord jesus when he comes is it not you indeed you are our glory and joy
1200178 since you know you will receive an inheritance from the lord as a reward
1200179 if what he has built survives he will receive his reward but if it burns up he will suffer loss he himself will be saved but only as one escaping through the flames
1200180 i don t really need any rewards all i want is to get to heaven
1200181 eat drink and be merry fear not you are destined for heaven leave the work of winning souls to us the clergy and other qualified persons
1200182 a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any so he said to the man who took care of the vineyard for three years i have been looking for fruit on this fig tree and haven t found any cut it down why should it use up the soil sir the man replied leave it alone for one more year and i will dig around it and fertilizer it if it bears fruit next year fine if not cut it down
1200183 works fruit and deeds will not give a person salvation
1200184 in reply jesus said a man was going from jerusalem to jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers
1200185 i am sure someone else will see what happened and care for him we just don t have the time
1200186 do nothing out of vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourself each of you should look not only to your own interest but also to the interest of others your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
1200187 nobody should seek their own good but the good of others
1200188 do not be deceived god can not be mocked a man reaps what he sows
1200189 it is the clergies responsibility that is why i am paying them let them help the needy again i am free of my responsibility thank you lord i feel better now
1200190 indeed when gentiles non christians who do not have the law christ s commands do by nature things required by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law since they show the requirements of the law are written on their hearts
1200191 as you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming
1200192 how profitable this fable of christ has been for us
1200193 o my god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee but most of all because you are all good and deserving of all my love and i detest of all my sins because i dread the loss of heaven and pains of hell therefore i firmly resolve with the help of thy grace to confess my sins do penance and amend my life amen
1200194 the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons they forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods
1200195 after jesus had gone indoors his disciples asked him privately
1200196 during the days of jesus life on earth he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission
1200197 i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing he will do even greater things than these because i am going to the father and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
1200198 is not this the kind of fasting i have chosen
1200199 you are not your own you were bought by jesus christ at a price therefore honor god with your body
1200200 does that mean we have to add to what christ s did for us to be saved
1200201 for we are god s workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god has created in advance for us to do
1200202 we must obey two of god s greatest and most important commands which are mentioned at least half a dozen times in scripture
1200203 teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind the gospel of mark adds and with all your strength and the second is like it love your neighbor as yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandment
1200204 though i am not free from god s law but am under christ s law therefore it is necessary since we also are under
1200205 the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love
1200206 they say that love s a word a word we ve only heard but can t begin to know the meaning of
1200207 let no one deceive you with empty words for because of such things god s wrath comes on those who are disobedient
1200208 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he cannot be my disciple
1200209 anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
1200210 the man who loves his life will lose it while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life
1200211 in this same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself after all no one ever hated his own body but he feeds and cares for it just as christ does the church
1200212 for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
1200213 if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
1200214 anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
1200215 we live by faith not by sight we are confident i say and would prefer to be away from the body and home with the lord
1200216 for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother
1200217 this is to my father s glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples
1200218 nobody should seek his own good but the good of others
1200219 for i am not seeking my own good but the good of many so that they may be saved follow my example as i follow the example of christ
1200220 do nothing out of selfish ambitions or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves
1200221 and if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to christ
1200222 not only you and your family but the many who are lost
1200223 i dont have a problem with jews in general but dont you think its interesting that the israel lobby is so powerful no of course the jews arent controlling the american government but why is the american government doing whatever israel wants it to all politicians have to get the approval of the right wing jewish lobby im just saying we all need to think about this you know anti semitism sucks but you know im just saying heres a link to an article that proves me right

1200225 who the hell is this guy and why would i want to talk with him
1200226 one of the challenges of caring for patients with li fraumeni syndrome is that it is difficult to predict when a cancer may develop
1200227 these findings suggest that screening for cnvs in families predisposed to cancer may help identify those who are at highest risk and help us to detect any cancer early
1200228 early detection is critical because we know that most cancers can be treated if they are caught early enough this is important research that is bringing us closer to answers and options for people with li fraumeni syndrome
1200229 as a cancer survivor and mother of two kids who will likely face a cancer diagnosis in the near future im happy that ive equipped myself through genetic testing and screening with the best possible tools to deal with all possible outcomes
1200230 reluctant anarchism vs loud and proud anarchism a bridgeable chasm
1200231 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
1200232 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death
1200233 how do you drive a war fan crazy tell him his pre order date has changed
1200234 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were sorry youre not going to know
1200235 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1200236 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1200237 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1200238 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1200239 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1200240 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1200241 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single why they called them the fighting they won the world championship
1200242 its not a major deal its what happens it makes teams better
1200243 there has been some concern among investors that perhaps there is more to his resignation than meets the eye perhaps accounting or other issues that have yet to come to light is there anything more
1200244 there are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with jeffs departure there are no accounting issues no trading issues no reserve issues no previously unknown problem issues the company is probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been in

1200250 these guys have been together for a while now and the bottom line is that the guys want to be good and there is leadership on the team
1200251 there are guys who have played a lot of snaps around here and you see them starting to step out and that needs to continue to happen

1200281 cant afford to both go on vacation and send their son to boy scout camp
1200282 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president the former president told abc
1200283 i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1200284 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1200285 his strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president
1200286 and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1200287 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition

1200293 barack obama believes the doubling of oil prices in the last year is a crisis for millions of americans and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries many of them hostile to our interests is a threat to our national security
1200294 you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market
1200295 consistent about his belief that the president should retain his discretionary authority to conduct exchanges or swaps
1200296 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1200297 i dont want to put more investments in the madison municipal building until i have an answer to this question

1200300 oncologists are in need of better tools to help identify children at a high risk of developing cancer
1200301 our use of new high resolution techniques allowed us to discover that these genetic changes which we had always thought only existed in tumours can also be found in the patients blood
1200302 we believe that these cnvs can act as the basis for how structural alterations occur in the tumour genome
1200303 in this paper we propose a model for how cnvs contribute to both inherited and sporadic cancers
1200304 we anticipate that early screening will allow us to identify patients with the highest risk so that cancers can be identified and treated at an earlier stage furthermore since the findings speak to our fundamental understanding of the genetic basis of cancer this may lead to advances in personalized medicine for our patient population
1200305 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1200306 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1200307 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1200308 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect

1200323 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1200324 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1200325 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1200326 one thing i would say about it is this we have the opportunity with the carbon pollution reduction scheme as proposed by the government to get on the path to reducing emissions
1200327 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1200328 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1200329 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1200330 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1200331 please be ensured that at fosters we have done everything possible to ensure that this will never ever happen again

1200396 what does objectivity mean with respect to morality surely it means unchanging and yet the god of the old testament is so very different from the god of the new testament the injunctions in the old testament the commands of god are different from those in the new testament and in both cases many of them are morally obnoxious
1200397 physical facts do not logically entail mental facts just as physical facts do not logically entail moral facts

1200481 i was more struck by the preamble to that comment by obamas statements that mccain and the republican party are so bankrupt in policies that they can win only by spreading fear this resonates with an article of faith among many democratic believers that has been so long and deeply held it is hardly considered noteworthy that democratic policies are so obviously superior and so much more in the interest of a majority of voters that only some form of chicanery can explain republican election victories

1200487 weve also got to toss aside the mindset that the status quo is reasonable
1200488 its one thing for gluttony to be an individual right cherished as much as freedom of speech its quite another for it to be a rite of patriotism and its still another for it to put us in direct conflict with other nations that profit from and or reject the monetary policy that piggishness requires

1200542 born a year after the russian revolution for the very long years of soviet terror he incarnated dissidence
1200543 it was alexander solzhenitsyn who opened the eyes of the world to the reality of the soviet system giving a universal reach to his experience
1200544 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky
1200545 he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1200546 will be remembered as an intellectual who provided us with a testimony tinged with suffering and a sharp and accurate view on the tragedies of 20th century totalitarianism

1200548 one of the greatest european writers of the 20th century an author who contributed to changing the course of history

1200550 a central character in the tragic history of 20th century russia
1200551 on days like today we have a duty to remember him and his commitment to russia
1200552 solzhenitsyn was a great writer and a moral witness bringing the evils of the gulag to the attention of the world
1200553 his brave and arduous lifes journey which included surviving the gulag internal and external exile made him one of the 20th centurys most important voices in the struggle against the tyranny of totalitarian regimes
1200554 proved that we can without contradiction be patriotic and still face up to dark episodes of our history

1200562 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1200563 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1200564 we used a population sample that is more than two million times larger than the group studied earlier and confirmed the classic finding

1200583 there were multiple points of origin found inside the building
1200584 last fall we saw a change in the business climate we call it the non recession going on its been a very difficult economic time for our customers and workers and business has been very difficult
1200585 srila prabhupada said in a gita lecture in london on 20 august 1973 such references have created an impression of the
1200586 but you just quoted srila prabhupada as saying that grihamedhis are animals
1200587 grhamedhi means that he does not know anything else than to support the wife and children and live very comfortably
1200588 householder life means wife children home these things are understood by everyone why our devotees have taken it as something different they simply have some sex desire get themselves married and when the matter does not fulfill their expectations immediately there is separation these things are just like material activities prostitution
1200589 so grhamedhi means center is home and he goes round throughout the whole life they are called grhamedhis so actually round the wife grhamedhi round the wife
1200590 once it is adopted the grhastha life even it may be troublesome at times it must be fulfilled as my occupational duty devotional service is what is important not my occupational duty but it does not mean that because occupation duty is not the real consideration that i should give it up and do something else thinking that devotional service may be carried on under whatever circumstances which i may whimsically decide

1200592 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1200593 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
1200594 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
1200595 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
1200596 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1200597 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1200598 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1200599 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1200600 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1200601 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1200602 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1200603 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1200604 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1200605 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
1200606 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
1200607 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of blood work to see if theres anything else

1200617 we are the face of chaos and the harbingers of judgment we laugh in the face of tragedy well mock those who are in pain we rush the lives of other people simply because we can hundred die in a plane crash we laugh the nation mourns over a school shooting we laugh were the embodiment of humanity with no remorse no caring no love or no sense of morality
1200618 on tuesday morning may 6 2008 the church of scientology international hosted its first interfaith conference concerning internet hate crime
1200619 i am not quite so sure lets wait until he is done from the bleachers
1200620 i just want to go somewhere that is safe ok
1200621 the hotel me and your wife is there we are just having some dr pepper do you want some
1200622 its alright dont you worry hey munk isnt your brother a doctor

1200624 around 20 minutes ok if i am not back soon call my cell
1200625 do what you feel in your heart to be right for youll be criticized anyway youll be damned if you do and damned if you dont
1200626 most people rust out due to a lack a challenge few people rust out due to overuse
1200627 you should not live one way in private another in public
1200628 for what i have received may the lord make me truly thankful and more truly for what i have not received
1200629 its like a trainwreck only i am the engineer on the train going full speed ahead whoo

1200631 im thinking to myself what the heck am i supposed to do about this one
1200632 thats something that can definitely cause some chemistry problems if they dont deal with it
1200633 most fights you see in practice theyre not like that maybe some pushing and shoving then other guys jump in and break it up and its like no problem that one there that sounds ugly
1200634 you dont have to like all your teammates but you have to respect them
1200635 it can become a problem if you allow it to if you dont sit down and talk about it
1200636 as a coach you have to set down a rule that you cant break somebodys nose on the sideline
1200637 and if youre going to miss two games youre probably going to think about it a little more but i dont think it causes a chemistry problem its not like this is a womens basketball team
1200638 actually al cowlings and ron singleton in my last year 1979 playing in san francisco was pretty much like that
1200639 that was a bad one probably the worst one like that they were rolling around on the ground punching each other it took a lot to break it up
1200640 it didnt have a lasting effect on the team it was just a wild ugly fight it appeared to be a really bad one that could last but after that they were just teammates i dont know how they felt about each other but it didnt affect the team
1200641 i havent been part of a fight like the smith lucas fight most times that i have seen fights with the redskins theyve been intense but guys can almost high five on the way into the locker room
1200642 it doesnt linger its something thats resolved quickly theres a lot of tension on the practice field so its not uncommon for something like that to happen what you hope for as a team if i was involved in a fight is go in the locker room and say sorry dude and get it over with
1200643 i havent had many because i dont let our guys fight in practice
1200644 i tell them youre going to get the same thing that you would get in a game kicked out of the game and a 10 000 fine so we dont have many fights
1200645 the eye of the hurricane crossed over my home it was washed away the only thing left were the columns it was devastating
1200646 we lived on a peninsula in pass christian mississippi with 440 homes only two were left standing my parents also lost their home from a family point of view it was very tough
1200647 our business facility was 13 feet under water so i did one smart thing i went and bought another shipyard
1200648 it made me realise that you are going to have tough times and its what you do with them i could have taken the insurance money and retired but i had 550 employees counting on me
1200649 i left no stone unturned we won our trials 10 months ago that was our first goal now our goal is trying to leave qingdao with a medal
1200650 im the skipper and he understands that but we are a team on the boat we talk things over constantly we balance each other well he is young and enthusiastic im a little more cagey and foxy
1200651 there are obviously some tense moments its like a marriage we spend a lot of time together and you throw in that he is married to my daughter shes probably the one with the toughest position being caught between the two of us
1200652 we go to the gym five days a week im there at 5 a m every morning before i go to work
1200653 having the games in qingdao played into my decision that we can compete at this level i dont plan on trying for england in 2012 when ill be 62 and it blows 20 25 knots thats why ive pulled out all the stops

1200666 as rising petrol prices continue to put pressure on all motorists lpg offers an affordable solution that is already widely available
1200667 it gives motorists access to large car benefits at small car fuel costs
1200668 with this further incentive from holden and continuing support from the federal government through its lpg rebate scheme australians now have another cost effective option available to them when choosing their next family or business vehicle
1200669 it is unlikely that will happen today but we think looking forward a relaxation of rates may well be warranted for australian businesses and consumers
1200670 we think to date that the rba has acted appropriately in heading off inflationary expectations
1200671 however since the reserve bank lifted rates in march this year a number of major international factors have influenced the slowdown in economic demand
1200672 this has all had the impact of markedly slowing demand in the australian economy
1200673 we dont believe that a rate reduction of something like 0 25 per cent is immediately going to make the economy boil over we just think it is an appropriate time for the rba to now consider a reduction
1200674 its a question of balance for the rba and thats what they are trying to do
1200675 they are trying to balance out the stimulatory impact of our higher national income caused by high commodity prices and improving terms of trade against lower domestic demand hitting the retail sector hitting building construction and housing
1200676 we would expect with a competitive banking system that commercial banks would have to lower rates otherwise customers move
1200677 thats significantly pushed the us dollar higher and hurt the aussie and the kiwi us dollars and other currencies
1200678 the selling pressure on the australian dollar has come from the fact weve had a fall in commodity prices and weve seen a rebound in the us dollar
1200679 of course these improvements in passenger facilitation have required substantial investment and security costs continue to be well above the level which is currently recoverable under the existing airline charging agreement
1200680 whilst the second quarter performance demonstrates the resilience of the airport operating model we are cognisant of the difficulties which the current operating environment presents to our major airline customers
1200681 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1200682 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1200683 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1200684 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1200685 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1200686 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1200687 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1200688 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1200689 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1200690 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product
1200691 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets
1200692 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between three and four per cent
1200693 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1200694 theyre employing still i think permanently between 400 and 500 people during the peak season they employ up to another 4000 he said
1200695 my understanding is too that theyre investing something like 10 million in new facilities
1200696 so spcs a great company its here to stay theyre investing more but the combination of drought and tough international conditions means regrettably that theyve had to reduce staff
1200697 while weve been through this flat period as a number of other developed countries have particularly those with high levels of investment in the property sector things are looking better for the latter part of this year
1200698 in a softening economy people will be very hesitant about price increases and other things so thats given us enough room to cut interest rates
1200699 we have said that we have room to cut actually were in a better position than most oecd countries because weve done what we think is the right thing and we increased during good times
1200700 with a view to developing an enhancement to the bid proposal
1200701 the discussions are ongoing and incomplete and there is no certainty that the discussions will result in any changes to the terms of the proposed stanhill offer or to the bid proposal
1200702 our view is that the economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter in june treasury said
1200703 annual average growth in real production gdp in the calendar 2008 year is expected to slow to 0 5 to 0 75 it said
1200704 we think the consumer is out for the count for the foreseeable future he said
1200705 both in new zealand and in australia we have been spending more than we earn on the back of rising housing prices this is obviously not a sustainable strategy it was always going to come crashing down he said the affordable designer

1200708 quentin represents a far more interesting option as he is a young rh of out of stanford remember the tribes predilection to stanford guys garko guthrie gerut who has battled injury right hamstring then rotator cuff since coming into mlb after cruising through the system his ops by year level and age is pretty impressive 2007 aaa age 24 1 004 2006 aaa age 23 906 2005 aaa age 22 942 2004 aa age 21 976 2004 a age 21 990 this to me looks like a player simply blocked organizationally while producing at every level hes been at up to mlb while his hr totals have never been eye popping he has always had a consistently high obp something the tribe deep thinkers love and has high 2b totals which could translate to hr as he adjusts to mlb pitching quentin did just undergo rotator cuff surgery non throwing arm which will keep him out of action until april so his health concerns would be comparable to choo but if the indians are happy to do the same thing that they did in the bullpen last year let the veterans keep a place warm for the youngsters to assert themselves and they feel that quentin will bounce back from the rotator cuff not a certainty they could find themselves a rh bat to handle lf and possibly buy low on him because of the injury concerns
1200709 we chose anodized silver for the body sides and high gloss black for the hood which flows through the glass roof it was almost like having a canopy

1200713 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower u s economic growth is impeaching demand
1200714 we do expect oil prices to trend lower in the longer term
1200715 at the moment people are taking the view that the glass is half empty rather than half full
1200716 rather than looking at the positive side that weaker commodities take the pressure off inflation people are seeing it as a product of slower growth

1200763 tomorrow the king of glory sets foot upon the stage in divine personal one to one visitation
1200764 unfortunately today people are looking for god in all the wrong places
1200765 theyre going to hear in lakeland all kinds of things from people being resurrected from the dead not true no details no descriptions to supposedly people being pickled and marinated in the spirit in fact theyre going to hear about vibrating in the spirit now this guy is an absolute phony unfortunately people are falling for his ruse
1200766 when you say god did something he didnt do or the holy spirit told you something he didnt tell you thats blasphemous
1200767 every few years here comes another fraudulent scandal riddled faith healer
1200768 thats sadly no surprise i am not dubious about healing i believe that god heals today we all know however that there are those who will use the power of god to peddle a product
1200769 whats most tragic about this cycle though is the fact that theres always a constituency for guys like this i fear that its more than just p t barnums famous old maxim about the gullibility of the american public i fear that theres something missing in our churches that drives even some of our people to charlatans might there be less of a demand for these traveling health and wealth revivalists if our churches spent more time on our knees in prayer for sick and hurting people
1200770 perhaps if we gave more attention to prayer in our own churches the most desperate among us in our neighborhoods and in our pews would have less reason to search out a self appointed carnival tent apostle
1200771 prophesied that by 1977 all denominations would be consumed by the world council of churches under the control of the roman catholics the rapture would take place and the world would be destroyed
1200772 there was a boy born blind in one eye healed today

1200775 cancer is going to be defeated spirit of cancer come out of your body i rebuke every cancerous tumor i rebuke terminal cancer i command every cancer to come out of your body
1200776 i want to hear you contend for your miracle because the power of god that healing anointing is here right now and god is beginning to move and were releasing that river of healing right now
1200777 people get stingy when they give but they want a generous blessing
1200778 im telling you theres something about you reap what you sow so you think about that as i sow you think about what god wants you to plant as a revival seed
1200779 i just love god and show up and god shows up we pray for the sick and people get healed and set free because i believe the bible i believe the word of god
1200780 jesus said i have a ministry for you and it begins today mothers day 1998
1200781 come on people of god were after a revival atmosphere
1200782 not only is judging permissible it is a responsibility nobodys teachings are above sound judgment especially those who have influence and power
1200783 while our lord cautioned followers not to judge self righteously he also counseled them to make judgments based on right standards and in the context of oft quoted commands by jesus such as judge not or you too will be judged jesus also exhorted us to judge false prophets whose teachings and whose behavior lead people to abject misery thus while were commanded not to judge hypocritically we are nevertheless called to judge

1200797 kami empat belas orang di dalam kalangan kang ouw kami mempunyai juga sedikit nama

1200806 ouw sinshe orang yang menggunakan bunga emas itu siang atau malam bakal datang kemari
1200807 aku juga telah melihat bahwa kaupun tidak bakalan mati secara baik maka itu aku pikir baiklah kita bergabung bekerja sama melawan dia bukankah ada terlebih baik begitu dari pada kau nantikan kematianmu dengan tidak berdaya
1200808 jikalau kamu semua masih dapat melawan dia siang siang kamu telah membunuh mampus padanya
1200809 apakah perlunya aku mendapatkan lima belas kantong nasi yang tidak mempunyai guna

1200816 biarpun dia berdiam di sini sepuluh tahun aku tetap tidak menolongnya
1200817 hanya sayang di dalam tempo satu tahun racun dingin yang mengeram dalam isi perutnya akan mengamuk sehingga biar bagaimanapun jua dia tak bisa hidup setahun lagi aku pernah bersumpah di hadapan leluhur agama kami bahwa biarpun ayah sendiri biarpun anak kandungku sendiri aku tetap tak akan menolong jika ia bukan murid beng keuw
1200818 bocah boe tong pay itu mengerti juga sedikit ilmu pengobatan meskipun ilmu pengobatan boe tong tidak dapat menandingi ilmu ketabiban beng kauw kurasa dia tidak akan membinasakan kamu dengan pengobatan yang keliru apa dia suka monolong atau tidak bukan urusanku
1200819 jika thio siauw hiap sudi menolong kami mempunyai haranan lagi untuk bisa hidup terus
1200820 boe kie kau dengarlah aku melarang kau mengobati mereka dalam rumahku kalau kamu tidak berada dalam rumah ini aku tidak perduli
1200821 pengetahuanku tentang ilmu ketabiban sebenarnya sangat cetek dan luka kalian sangat luar biasa
1200822 maka itu aku tidak mempunyai pegangan apa aku akan berhasil atau tidak jika kalian percaya dan rela diobati olehku bolehlah aku mencoba coba tapi aku tidak bertanggung jawab akan keselamatan jiwa kalian
1200823 sebagaimana kalian tahu ouw sinshe tidak mengijinkan aku mengobati kalian di dalam rumahnya ia merasa kuatir bahwa kalian mati di sini nama harumnya sebagai ie sian tabib malaikat akan ternoda maka itu marilah kita keluar
1200824 kulit kepalaku gatal bukan main saudara kecil kau boleh mengobati aku lebih dulu
1200825 bocah itu memiliki kepandaian lumayan eh salah thio siauw hiap kau memiliki ilmu yang sangat tinggi dan aku merasa sangat berterima kasih sekali kepadamu
1200826 andaikata ada seorang murid beng kauw yang sedangkan di luar badannya tidak terdapat luka perutnya kembung bengkak warna kulitnya hitam biru dan terus menerus berada dalam keadaan pingsan cara bagaimana sinshe akan mengobatinya
1200827 kalau benar dia murid beng kauw aku akan mengobatinya dengan menggunakan san ka liong bwee ang hoa seng tee leng sian to ouw
1200828 obat obatan itu aku masak dengan arak encer dan kemudian menambahkannya dengan sedikit to pian sesudah minum godokan tersebut si sakit akan buang buang air dan mengeluarkan darah beracun dari kotorannya
1200829 ouw sinshe bagaimana aku akan berbuat jika kuping kiri seorang muiid beng kauw dituangi timah cair kuping kanan dituangi dengan air perak dan kedua matanya dilabur dengan cat sehingga ia menderita kesakitan hebat dan matanya tak bisa melihat lagi
1200830 tapi menurut pendapatku yang paling perlu ialah mengobati lebih dulu dan kemudian barulah kita menanyakan siapa adanya musuh itu
1200831 kalau dia memang murid beng kauw aku akan menuang air perak k edalam kuping kiri nya timah akan lumer dan bercampur dengan air perak sehingga cairan itu akan mengalir ke luar dari kupingnya kemudian aku akan memasukkan jarum emas ke dalam kuping kanannya air perak akan menempel pada jarum itu yang dengan perlahan bisa di tarik keluar mengenai cat yang masuk di kedua matanya kurasa akan dapat dipunahkan dengan kepiting yang ditumbuk hancur dan kemudian dibalut pada matanya itu
1200832 sebab musabab dari perubahan itu ialah karena luka mereka sangat aneh berbeda dengan luka biasa
1200833 kalau mereka dapat disembuhkan oleb tabib biasa tak perlu mereka datang kemari
1200834 tapi walaupun begitu tak bisa jadi semua penderita itu mengalami perubahan sampai berkali kali sebentar baik sebentar hebat
1200835 eh eh mengapa ouw sinahe berkeliaran di tengah malam buta
1200836 meskipun aku bukan tandingannya tak dapat aku mengawasi dengan berpeluk tangan
1200837 orang telah menaruh racun di mangkok obatmu buanglah obat itu tapi jagalah jangan sampai diketahui orang besok aku akan memberi penjelasan kepadamu
1200838 poet jie sekarang jangan mengejar kupu kupu lagi pergi petik bunga bunga dan buatlah tiga buah topi bunga untuk kita bertiga
1200839 apakah kau mempunyai permusuhan dengan ouw ceng goe dialah yang sudah menaruh racun kedalam mangkok obatmu
1200840 aku belum pernah mengenal ouw ceng goe dan sehingga hari ini aku belum pernah bertemu muka dengannya
1200841 saban kali bicara mengenai ouw sinshe thia thia ayah dan soehoe selalu mengatakan bahwa dia adalah seorang tabib nomor satu di dalam dunia pada jaman ini merekapun tidak mengenal ouw sinshe aku sungguh tidak mengerti mengapa ouw sinshe coba mencelakakan aku
1200842 dalam godokan pat sian thung itu aku mengendus bau rumput pat sian co dan touw koet koen yang sangat tajam kedua daun obat itu memang dapat mengobati luka tapi racunnya sangat hebat dan tidak boleh digunakan terlalu banyak
1200843 selain begitu sifat kedua daun obat tersebut juga bertentangan dengan delapan macam obat yang terdapat dalam pat sian thung maka itu biarpun tidak membahayakan jiwa luka kouw kouw jadi makin sukar disembuhkannya
1200844 kau mengatakan bahwa ouw sinshe juga meracuni empat belas penderita yang lain
1200845 hal ini lebih mengherankan lagi terhadap aku kita dapat mengandalkan saja bahwa secara tidak disengaja ayah atau go bie pay pernah menyinggung ouw sinshe tapi bagaimana terhadap yang lainnya apa mungkin ke empat belas orang itu semuanya berdosa terhadap ouw sinshe
1200846 kie kouwkouw selat ouw tiap kok adalah sebuah tempat yang mencil dan tidak banyak diketahui orang cara bagaimana kau dan yang lain lain bisa datang kemari siapa adanya kim hoa coe jin majikan bunga emas yang telah melukai kau urusan ini sebenarnya tiada sangkut pautnya dengan aku dan menurut pantas aku sebenarnya tidak boleh menanya melit melit akan tetapi karena persoalan berbelit belit maka aku harap kau tidak menjadi kecil hatinya
1200847 kau sudah menolong jiwaku tak dapat aku menyembunyikan sesuatu terhadapmu di samping itu meskipun masih kanak kanak kau memperlakukan aku dan poet jie luar biasa baik baiklah aku akan menceritakan segala penderitaanku kepadamu orang satu satunya di dalam dunia yang boleh mendengar rahasiaku
1200848 sedari aku kebentrok dengan seorang kakak seperguruan pada dua tahun lebih yang lalu aku tidak berani menemui soe hoe lagi aku tidak berani pulang
1200849 in lioksiok adalah seorang baik kalau kau tidak suka menikah dengannya urusan itu bukan urusan yang terlalu besar begini saja kalau bertemu dengan lioksiok aku akan memberitahukannya bahwa kau tidak suka menikah dan dia merdeka untuk mencari lain isteri
1200850 anak ini masih suci bersih bagaikan selembar kertas putih ah lebih baik aku tidak menceriterakan segala hal percintaan kepadanya apa pula urusan pribadi ini tiada sangkut pautnya dengan dia
1200851 sesudah bercekcok dengan teng soecie dengan membawa poet jie aku bertani dan hidup mengasingkan diri di suatu tempat yang terpisah kira kira tiga ratus lie di sebelah barat ouw tiap kok ini selama dua tahun lebih aku hanya bergaul dengan kaum petani dan aku dapat melewati hari dengan tidak banyak pikiran setengah bulan yang lalu aku mengajak poet jie kekota untuk membeli kain guna pakaian anakku itu di luar dugaan di atas sebuah tembok secara kebetulan aku melihat gambar sebuah lingkaran hoed kong lingkaran sinar buddha yang suci dan sebatang pedang
1200852 itulah tanda rahasia memanggil kawan dari partai go bie pay aku binguog dan sangat bersangsi sesudah menimbang nimbang aku menganggap bahwa meskipun aku telah kebentrok dengan teng soecie tapi aku belum pernah melakukan perbuatan yang menghina guru atau menghianati partai di samping itu bentrokan tersebut juga tak ada sangkut pautnya dengan soehoe dan lain lain saudara seperguruan tanda itu mungkim diberikan oleh salah seorang saudara seperguruanku yang tengah menghadapi bahaya besar dan jika benar begitu aku merasa tidak pantas untuk berpeluk tangan demikianlah dengan menuruti petunjuk dari tanda rahasia itu aku pergi ke hong yang
1200853 di kota hong yang aku kembali melihat tanda itu yang memberi petunjuk supaya kawan kawan datang di rumah makan lim hway kok sudah ketelanjuran datang aku segera menyusul ke situ ternyata dalam rumah makan sudah berkumpul tujuh delapan orang antaranya terdapat seng cioe ka lam kan ciat dari khong tong pay sie kong wan dari hwa san pay dan lain lain anggauta goe bie pay hanya aku seorang aku mengenal kan ciat dan sie kong wan dan lalu menanyakan sebab musabab dari berkumpulnya mereka di rumah makan itu mereka memberitahukan bahwa mereka datang karena melihat tanda rahasia partainya tapi seperti juga aku mereka tak tahu sebab musabab dari panggilan itu sehari suntuk kami menunggu tapi tak ada yang datang lagi pada esokan harinya dengan beruntun datang pula beberapa orang lain ada orang sin koen boen ada orang siauw lim pay bagian selatan dan lain lain mereka juga mengatakan bahwa kedatangan mereka adalah karena melihat tanda rahasia tak satupun di antara mereka yang mendapat urusan secara langsung semua orang heran dan bercuriga apa tidak bisa jadi kami semua tengah dipermainkan oleh seorang musuh
1200854 ketika itu di loteng rumah makan berkumpul lima belas orang dari sembilan buah partai tanda rahasia setiap partai bukan saja berbeda satu sama lain tapi juga sangat dirahasiakan sehingga kalau bukan murid partai yang tersangkut seorang luar tentu tak mengerti artinya tanda itu jika seseorang ingin main gila apakah ia bisa tahu tanda rahasia dari sembilan partai mengingat bahwa aku membawa poet jie dan kalau bisa aku tak mau anak itu menghadapi bahaya dan mengingat pula bahwa panggilan itu bukan mengenai saudara seperguruanku ada yang tengah menghadapi bencana besar maka aku segera mengambil keputusan untuk pulang saja tapi baru saja aku mau turun tangan tiba tiba di tangga loteng terdengar suara keras seperti juga undakan tangga dipukul orang dengan menggunakan toya suara itu disusul denggn suara batuk batuk dan seorang nenek yang rambutnya sudah putih semua mendaki undakan tangga ia naik setindak demi setindak sambil batuk batuk dan kelihatannya lelah sekali di sampingnya terdapat seorang nona kecil yang berusia kira kira dua belas tahun dan yang memapah si nenek
1200855 melihat nenek yang sudah bagitu tigggi usianya dan juga kelihatannya sedang sakit aku segera minggir supaya ia bisa naik lebih dulu
1200856 perempuan tua itu tidak bisa lain dari pada majikan kim hoa
1200857 benar tapi pada waktu itu siapakah yang bisa menduga jelek kepadanya
1200858 sesudah berada di atas loteng nenek itu kembali batuk batuk
1200859 si nona cilik berbisik popo makan obat ya si nenek mengangguk dan nona kecil itu selanjutnya sudah mengeluarkan sebutir yo wan dari dalam sebuah peles kristal
1200860 sambil mengunyah yo wan nenek itu berkata o mie to hoed o mie to hoed dengan mata separuh tertutup ia mengawasi kami dan berkata pula dengan suara perlahan hm hanya lima belas orang
1200861 kedatangan kedua wanita itu tidak diperhatikan oleh kami tapi begitu si nenek mengucapkan perkataan itu beberapa orang yang kupingnya lebih tajam segera menengok dan mengawasinya melihat nenek itu hati mereka lega dan menganggap mereka salah dengar
1200862 tiba tiba si nona cilik berkata dengan suara nyaring hai
1200863 semua orang terkejut untuk sejenak mereka tak dapat mengeluarkan sepatah katapun
1200864 popoku menanya mengapa ia tidak melihat murid boe tong dan koen loen
1200865 nenek itu kembali batuk batuk sambil membungkuk bungkuk mendadak mendadak saja aku merasa semacam angin menyambar dadaku entah dari mana sambaran itu hebat luar biasa dan buru buru aku mengibaskan tangan untuk menangkis tiba tiba aku merasa dadaku menyesak darahku bergolak golak kedua lututku lemas dan aku jatuh duduk sambil muntahkan darah
1200866 dalam keadaan setengah pingsan aku melihat badan si nenek bergerak gerak ia menggaplok atau meninju seraya batuk batuk tak hentinya dalam sekejap empat belas orang sudah rebah di atas loteng kecepatan bergeraknya dan hebatnya tenaganya tak dapat dilukiskan dengan kata kata seumur hidup belum pernah kulihat manusia yang bisa bergerak begitu cepat dan mempunyai tenaga lweekang yang sedemikian hebat di antara kami sejurus pun tak ada yang mampu melawan kalau bukan tertotok jalan darah isi perut mereka terluka karena pukulan lweekang
1200867 tiba tiba si nenek mengayun tangan kirinya dan lima belas bunga emas menyambar ke bahu atau tangan kelimabelas orang kali ini dia tidak mencelakakan orang sebab meskipun limabelas bunga emas itu mengenai tepat pada sasarannya tak seorangpun yang mendapat luka sesudah itu dia memutar tubuh dan dengan dipapah oleh si nona kecil ia berkata o mie to hoed o mie to hoed tanpa menengok lagi mereka turun ke bawah loteng beberapa saat kemudian kami mendengar suara totokan tongkat ditanah diseling seling dengan suara batuk batuk
1200868 kami semua rebah di atas papan loteng tanpa berkutik sebagian pingsan sebagian bernapas sengal sengal dan sebagian pula merintih dengan perlahan
1200869 apakah kau sedang menceritakan perempuan jahat itu jangan aku takut
1200870 pergilah kau memetik bunga lagi dan buatlah sebuah topi untuk kakak boe kie
1200871 merah dan campur sedikit dengan warna putih lebih besar topinya lebih baik lagi
1200872 beberapa lama kemudian dalam keadaan lupa ingat aku melihat belasan orang naik ke loteng
1200873 mereka itu adalah pelayan tukang masak dan pengurus rumah makan mereka menggotong kami ke dapur tak usah dikatakan lagi poet jie ketakutan setengah mati dan sambil menangis keras ia mengikuti orang orang yang menggotong aku setibanya di dapur si pengurus rumah makan membaca tulisan di selembar kertas seraya menuding kan ciat ia memerintah labur koyo di kepalanya seorang pelayan segera membuka sebuah kotak koyo dan melebur isinya di kepala kan ciat sesudah itu sambil membaca pula tulisan itu dia menuding seorang lain dan berkata putuskan tangan kanannya dan tempelkan lengan itu di kaki kirinya siksaan itu lantas saja dijalankan oleh dua orang pelayan waktu giliranku tiba untung juga aku tidak mendapat hukuman aneh aku hanya diperintah minum semangkoh air yang rasanya manis aku mengerti bahwa air itu tentu mengandung racun tapi aku tidak berdaya
1200874 sesudah kami semua mendapat hukuman yang luar biasa si pengurus rumah makan berkata kamu semua sudah mendapat luka yang tak mungkin disembuhkan lagi tak seorangpun di antara kamu yang bisa hidup sepuluh hari atau setengah bulan lagi tapi pemilik bunga emas mengatakan bahwa ia sama sekali tidak bermusuhan dengan kamu maka itu ia menaruh rasa belas kasihan dan membuka suatu jalan hidup untuk kamu sekarang pergilah kamu lekas lekas ke ouw tiap kok yang terletak di tepi telaga lie san ouw dan mintalah pertolongan dari ouw ceng goe yang bergelar tiap kok ie sian kalau dia sudi menolong maka kamu semua ada harapan hidup tapi manakala dia menolak dalam dunia tak ada orang yang bisa menolong kamu lagi tapi ouw ceng goe mempunyai lain julukan yaitu kian sie poet kioe kalau kamu tidak berusaha mati matian dia pasti tak akan mengulurkan tangan jika kamu bertemu dengan ouw ceng goe katakanlah bahwa tak lama lagi kim hoa coejin aku akan mencari dia dan dia harus siang siang mempersiapkan penguburan mayatnya sendiri sesudah berkata begitu dia segera menyediakan kerata dan kuda kuda memberi petunjuk mengenai jalanan yang harus diambil dan kemudian mengusir kami
1200875 didengar dari penuturanmu pengurus lim hway kok tukang masak dan pelayan pelayannya semua kaki tangan perempuan jahat itu
1200876 si pengurus rumah makan memerintahkan dijalankannya siksaan itu menurut surat catatan yang rasanya ditinggalkan oleh perempuan kejam itu tapi dalam peristiwa terdapat beberapa teka teki yang sehingga sekarang masih belum dapat dipecahkan olehku mengapa nenek itu melakukan perbuatan yang begitu kejam kalau dia mendendam sakit hati dan mau mengambil jiwa kami dia dapat melakukannya dengan mudah sekali jika dia hanya ingin menyiksa orang orang dengan rupa rupa jalan yang kejam mengapa dia mengirim kami kepada ouw sinshe dia mengatakan bahwa tak lama lagi dia akan mencari ouw sinshe untuk membalas sakit hati apakah penyiksaannya terhadap kami hanya untuk menjajal kepandaiannya ouw sinshe
1200877 menurut katanya siang gie coen toako ouw sinshe mempunyai seorang musuh yang akan datang untuk membalas sakit hati musuh itulah kim hoa coejie menurut pantas ouw sinshe seharusnya mengobati kalian dengan sungguh hati supaya kalian bisa membantu dia dalam menghadapi musuh berat itu sesuai dengan julukan kian sie poet kioe ia menolak untuk mengobati tapi mengapa sesudah menolak ia memberi berbagai resep kepadaku dan mengajarkan aku macam macam cara pengobatan untuk menolong kalian resep obat itu manjur sekali tapi mengapa di tengah malam buta ia menggerayang dan memberi racun kepada kalian ah sikap ouw sinshe sungguh aneh dalam peristiwa ini muncul banyak hal yang tak akan bisa ditembus olehku
1200878 mulai dari sekarang kau tidak boleh minum apapun juga kecuali jika obat itu diberikan olehku sendiri di waktu malam sebaiknya kau siap sedia dengan senjata untuk menjaga sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan sekarang kau masih belum boleh pulang karena aku masih perlu memberi obat untuk menyembuhkan luka di dalam badanmu begitu lekas lukamu tidak berbahaya lagi kau harus buru buru pulang dengan membawa poet hwie
1200879 if we said to anyone from interstate or overseas youre now arriving at keswick theres a question mark that was left by that
1200880 if you say youre arriving in the adelaide parklands terminal it gives them much more of a glimpse of whats to come
1200881 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1200882 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer
1200883 this news today im sure will overcome that problem virtually entirely
1200884 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1200885 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1200886 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1200887 being called smelly can be damaging to our personality in that sense deodorant products can be used as a confidence booster
1200888 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1200889 how would it be to know that their son is laying somewhere rotting and not being able to finally put him to rest so his family can move
1200890 his brothers are in hell were in hell his cousins all his friends
1200891 he was a much loved boy he was fun loving he would always like a good time he would give the shirt off his back to anybody who needed it
1200892 why someone would do something like this to my son i have no idea
1200893 its like origin state of origin football weve won the first game now we want the series
1200894 if anybody has any idea where matthew may be we need to hear from you
1200895 no evidence and no piece of information that is available is insignificant nothing is irrelevant
1200896 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
1200897 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets mr lewis said
1200898 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between 3 and 4 per cent
1200899 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1200900 there is a feeling that the general public and even some health professionals do not understand type one diabetes and this can have a terribly negative impact on people with the disease
1200901 obesity levels across nsw have soared in the past decade and are now at record levels with more than half of all adults and a quarter of all children overweight or obese
1200902 those figures are alarming and unless we do something to address the rising number of overweight and obese people living in nsw we will see significantly higher levels of chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes heart disease and some cancers
1200903 the afgc welcomes the nsw governments recognition that they have a significant role to play in assisting australians with obesity health related conditions
1200904 minister meaghers announcement represents just some of the practical measures that can be undertaken to assist australians suffering obesity health related conditions
1200905 the afgc looks forward to continuing to work with governments the nation over to help develop programs which will deliver positive public health outcomes
1200906 mr iksidis chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1200907 this was a case involving a number of disabled people all the employees involved in this sort of work were likely to be vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent
1200908 supermarket trolley return is after all scarcely at the top of the employment pecking order it is reasonable to suppose that those doing this work were desperate for the employment
1200909 they were given deliberately confusing contracts of employment and bullied if they stood up for their rights
1200910 i also accept that the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1200911 i further accept that responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally oriented and threatening correspondence
1200912 all businesses small and large have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees have an expectation that this will occur
1200913 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1200914 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1200915 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1200916 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1200917 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1200918 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1200919 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1200920 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1200921 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1200922 if you have to have serial killers why cant they kill someone who deserves to die like rappers
1200923 perempuan siluman mo kau ini telah membongkar rahasia caraku meyakinkan ilmu pedang bila hari ini aku tak dapat membereskan mereka kelak cerita tentang diriku tentu akan tersiar luas di kalangan kang ouw lalu apakah aku ada muka buat menjabat ketua ngo gak pay lagi agaknya segala rencana yang kurancang sejak dahulu akan buyar seluruhnya
1200924 mengapa bangsat cilik ini tersenyum apakah dia sudah mendapatkan jalan untuk mengalahkan diriku
1200925 ah kenapa aku sampai lupa dia kan guruku mana boleh aku mencelakai dia
1200926 kalah menang sudah jelas bagaimana kalau kita sudahi pertandingan ini paling perlu men nolong sunio lebih dulu
1200927 anak tiong apakah benar anak sian dibunuh oleh peng ci
1200928 dia tidak anggap tecu padamu aku masih tetap mengakui kau sebagai tecu murid
1200929 jadi tidak salah tentunya apa yang dikatakan yim siocia ini bahwa peng ci telah berhasil meyakinkan pi sia kiam hoat dan kini telah menggabungkan diri pada co leng tan sebab itulah dia membunuh anak sian
1200930 kelak tugas membunuh lim peng ci untuk menuntut balas bagi anak sian dengan sendirinya harus diserahkan padamu
1200931 tapi siau siausumoay telah pesan sebelum meninggal agar aku melindungi lim peng ci hal ini telah kusanggupi maka urusan ini sungguh serbasusah bagiku
1200932 anak tiong selanjutnya terhadap siapa pun juga janganlah kau terlalu baik hati
1200933 apa gunanya mempunyai suami pengecut dan tidak malu seperti dia itu kalau tidak membunuhnya ya terpaksa membunuh diri kita harus lekas binasakan gak put kun untuk membalas sakit hati ibu gurumu
1200934 kau bilang dia harus dibunuh betapa pun dia kan pernah menjadi guruku
1200935 meski dia pernah gurumu pernah membesarkan kau tapi sudah berapa kali dia bermaksud mencelakai kau antara budi dan sakit hati sudah klop dan hapus sebaliknya budi kebaikan ibu gurumu belum lagi kau balas coba pikir apakah kematian ibu gurumu bukan disebabkan perbuatannya
1200936 budi sunio rasanya sukar kubalas selama hidup ini seumpama aku tidak utang budi lagi kepada gak put kun betapa pun aku tidak dapat membunuh dia
1200937 atas titah kaucu hamba bersama kat toh dan bok tianglo bertiga bersama sepuluh saudara lain ditugaskan menangkap gak put kun dengan cara apa pun juga
1200938 tadi mereka pergi memancing kedatangan gak put kun dan sampai sekarang belum kembali mungkin mungkin mereka
1200939 lapor toasiocia kat tianglo dan toh tianglo memang benar telah dicelakai oleh keparat ini dalam bajunya diketemukan dua medali kebesaran kedua tianglo kita itu
1200940 orang she gak apakah kau yang membunuh kedua tianglo kami
1200941 memang aku yang membunuh mereka anggota mo kau yang jahat setiap orang berhak membunuhnya
1200942 kau menganggap dirimu adalah ketua golongan beng bun cing pay segala akan tetapi perbuatanmu entah berapa kali lebih kotor dan rendah daripada anak buah tiau yang sin kau kami tapi kau secara tidak tahu malu berani memaki kami sebagai orang jahat malahan istrimu sendiri merasa malu atas perbuatanmu ia lebih suka membunuh diri daripada menjadi istrimu apakah kau masih punya muka buat hidup terus di dunia ini
1200943 perempuan siluman sembarangan omong sudah jelas istriku dibunuh olehmu tapi kau mengatakan dia membunuh diri
1200944 aku tahu kau hendak minta agar kulepaskan dia hendaklah tahu bahwa ringkus harimau lebih gampang daripada melepaskan harimau
1200945 orang ini berhati keji dan berjiwa culas ilmu silatnya tinggi pula kelak kalau kau kepergok dia mungkin takkan gampang membekuk dia lagi
1200946 sekali ini hubunganku sebagai murid dan guru dengan dia sudah putus
1200947 ilmu pedangnya aku pun sudah paham seluruhnya jika dia berani mencari aku lagi maka aku pun tidak kenal ampun lagi padanya
1200948 baiklah hari ini boleh kita mengampuni jiwanya nah pau tianglo bok tianglo dan para saudara dalam agama selanjutnya kalian boleh siarkan di kalangan kang ouw bahwa gak put kun telah kita bekuk lalu kita ampuni dia siarkan pula bahwa gak put kun telah rela membikin cacat dirinya sendiri demi untuk meyakinkan pi sia kiam hoat sekarang dia sudah setengah gila laki laki bukan perempuan tidak supaya hal ini dimaklumi oleh para kesatria di seluruh jagat
1200949 awas jangan sekali kali kau muntahkan jika membangkang segera kuputuskan seluruh urat nadimu dengan siau tiong jiu hoat
1200950 engkoh tiong tutukan pau tianglo tadi rada berat kini sudah kubuka kembali hiat to yang tertutuk itu sebentar lagi dia baru dapat berjalan lagi
1200951 setiap hari toan ngo tiap tahun boleh kau datang ke hek bok keh aku akan memberi obat penawarnya padamu
1200952 obat mujarabku itu tidak mudah membuatnya dalam agama kami hanya tokoh tokoh utama yang berkedudukan tinggi dan berkepandaian tinggi saja yang memenuhi syarat untuk minum obat dewa itu betul tidak pau tianglo
1200953 atas anugerah kaucu pernah juga siokhe minum obat dewa itu maka selamanya siokhe sangat setia dan tunduk malahan kaucu juga menaruh kepercayaan penuh kepada siokhe sungguh tiada terkatakan manfaat daripada obat dewa tersebut
1200954 ah mungkin saking kelaparan sehingga dia makan barang apa saja yang dilihatnya
1200955 nah gak put kun selanjutnya kau harus berusaha membela kepentingan engkoh tiong dan aku hal ini akan berfaedah bagimu
1200956 jika perempuan siluman cilik ini kebetulan mengalami sesuatu atau dibunuh orang maka yang akan konyol tentulah diriku bahkan dia tidak sampai mampus tapi terluka parah umpamanya sehingga tidak dapat pulang ke hek bok keh pada hari toan ngo lalu ke mana aku dapat mencari dia
1200957 kau pulang ke hek bok keh dan lapor kepada kaucu katakan ketua ngo gak pay yang dihormati gak put kun gak siansing kini telah menggabungkan diri ke dalam agama kita dengan setulus hati obat dewa kaucu sudah diminumnya sehingga dia tidak mungkin berkhianat lagi
1200958 karena gak siansing sudah masuk anggota kita mengenai hal hal yang merugikan nama baiknya tidak perlu lagi kalian siarkan di luaran tentang pil dewa yang telah dimakannya lebih lebih jangan dibocorkan orang ini mempunyai kedudukan amat tinggi di dunia persilatan cerdas dan tangkas pula dalam segala hal kelak kaucu tentu akan memanfaatkan tenaganya
1200959 bila kalian pulang ke hek bok keh sampaikanlah hormat baktiku kepada ayah dan juga kepada hiang sioksiok katakan kepada beliau beliau itu bahwa nanti kalau kalau dia dia lenghou kongcu sudah sembuh lukanya barulah kami akan pulang ke sana

1201002 kiu im cin keng yang kau bikin lenyap itu kau mesti cari dan mendapatinya kembali untuk dikembalikan padaku jikalau kitab itu dapat dilihat orang lain dia mesti dibinasakan seorang yang melihat seorang yang dibunuh seratus orang melihat seratus orang juga yang mesti dibunuh itu umapama kau cuma membunuh sembilanpuluh sembilan orang jangan kau kembali padaku
1201003 orang menyebutnya oey yok su sebagai tong shia si sesat dari timur kelakuannya ini benar benar sesat sekali
1201004 tiga saudaramu boe phang dan kiok telah menderita karena perbuatanmu sekarang kau pergi cari leng hong setelah itu kau cari tahu dua saudara boe dan phang itu ada mempunyai turunan atau tidak semua turunan mereka itu kau bawa ke kwie in chung ini serahkan kepada seng hong supaya ia yang mengurusnya
1201005 kitab kiu im cin keng itu kamulah yang mengambilnya sendiri
1201006 ilmu dalam kitab itu aku tidak mengajarkan kamu kamu sendiri yang mempelajarinya kamu tahu apa yang harus kau perbuat
1201007 sesudah teecu berhasil membereskan yang pertama dan yang kedua itu teecu ketahui bagaimana harus menghabiskan sendiri kedua ilmu kiu im pek kut ciauw serta cwie sim ciang yang teecu berhasil menyakinkannya
1201008 tan hian hong yang emnjadi murid kepalaku kaulah yang membinasakan kepandaianmu bukan main
1201009 ketika itu teecu masih muda sekali dan belum tahu apa apa teecu kena tertangkap oleh tan cianpwee dalam ketakutan dan bingung teecu kesalahan tangan telah membinasakan dia
1201010 tan hian hong memang benar adalah murid murtad dari kalanganku tetapi untuk membinasakannya itulah hak kami apakah murid murid dari tho hoa to boleh di bunuh orang luar
1201011 ketika itu dia baru berumur enam tahu tahu apa dia
1201012 si pengemis tua she ang itu biasanya tidak suka menerima murid
1201013 tetapi sekarang ia telah mengajarkan kau hang ling sip pat ciang sampai limabelas jurus itulah tentu kau ada punya sifat sifat baik yang melebihkan lain lain orang tidak demikian pastilah kau sudah bujuk dia dengan akal apa yang membuat hatinya girang hingga ia suka menurunkan kepandaiannya itu kau telah menggunai kepandaiannya si pengemis tua untuk merobohkan hm hm kalau nanti si pengemis itu bertemu dengan aku bukankah ia bakal banyak bacot
1201014 tetapi bukannya dia yang mengakalinya hanya aku dia seorang yang polos jangan ayah berlaku galak dan membuatnya ketakutan
1201015 dengan si pengemis tua mengajarkan kau ilmu silat kau terang sudah dia menertawakan partaiku tidak ada orangnya bahwa setiap muridku tidak punya guna
1201016 ayah siapakah bilang partai tho hoa to tidak ada orangnya dia ini beruntung sebab mata bwee suci buta nanti aku membikin ayah puas
1201017 mari mari nanti aku gunai kebisaan biasa saja yang ayah ajarkan aku melayani kepandaian istimewa ang cit kong
1201018 biasanya aku aklah dari kau baik aku membiarkan kau menghajar aku dengan beberapa gebukan lagi
1201019 aku tidak mempunyai murid mari kau mencoba coba menyambut kau beberapa jurus
1201020 biarnya teecu bernyali sebesar langit tidak nanti teecu berani melayani locianpwee
1201021 kau tidak tepat bocah aku akan berdiri di sini tanpa bergerak kau boleh menyerang aku dengan hang liong sip pat ciang asal aku berkelit atau menangkis hitunglah aku kalah
1201022 apa boleh buat dia tentu hendak meminjam tenagaku untuk membikin aku roboh beberapa kali
1201023 apakah kau takut aku tidak sanggup bertahan untuk pukulanmu benarkah
1201024 biarlah kau ketahui yang mana yang lebih lihai hang liong sip pat ciang dari si pengemis tua atau kepandaian dari tho hoa to
1201025 tak usah sampai aku turun tangan hingga kau menjadi menderita
1201026 kalau sekarang kita mengubur tulang tulang kita di telaga thay ouw ini apakah lagi yang diberati
1201027 kematiannya pun tidak ada sangkut pautnya dengan semua guruku ini aku sendiri yang akan mengganti jiwanya
1201028 tapi sakit hati ayahku masih belum terbalas maka itu apakah locianpwee suka memberi tempo satu bulan kepadaku selewatnya tigapuluh hari teecu bakal datang sendiri ke pulau tho hoa to untuk menerima binasa
1201029 wanyen kang bukan sembarang orang tetapi ia dapat ditotok tanpa berbuat apa apa
1201030 enghiong untuk budi pertolonganmu ini aku toan thian tek tidak akan melupakan sekali pun sampai akhir ajalku
1201031 bukankah delapanbelas tahun yang lampau selama di lim an kau ada menjadi opsir tentara
1201032 aku adalah keponakan yang tidak menyucikan diri dari kouw bok taysu itu karenanya kita menjadi orang sendiri haha
1201033 aku yang rendah memohon pinjam ruangan belakang dari rumahmu ini
1201034 bila kau mau ikut dengan aku kita boleh jalan bersama sama aku sendiri akan segera pergi menemui soehoe ke go bie san kalau nasib baik dan beliau tidak mendengar hasutan soecieku maka untukmu masih ada sedikit harapan hidup karena beliau memang mempunyai niatan untuk menurunkan semua kepandaiannya kepadaku bahkan akan mengambil aku sebagai ahli warisnya manakala niatan itu dilaksanakan beliau terutama tentu akan menurunkan go bie kioe yang kang kepadaku selanjutnya aku bisa ajarkan ilmu itu kepadamu dengan memiliki go bie kioe yang kang kau bisa menggabungkannya dsngan siauwlim dan boe tong kioe yang kang sehingga rasanya racun dingin hian beng sin ciang bisa dengan gampang terusir keluar dari badanmu tapi aih sesudah aku melakukan perbuatan yang tidak pantas mana aku ada muka untuk bertemu lagi dengan soehoe mana bisa belia mengangkat aku menjadi ahli warisnya lagi
1201035 kie kouw kouw kau tak usah bersedih ouw sinshe mengatakan bahwa paling lama aku hanya bisa hidup setahun lagi akupun sering memeriksa keadaan badanku dan aku yakin bahwa apa yang dikatakan ouw sinshe bukan omong kosong andaikata gurumu mengajar go bie kioe yang kang kepadamu kurasa kaupun tak akan keburu menolong aku memang benar juga jalan yang paling baik adalah kita menyingkir sekarang juga tapi dalam cara mengobati lukamu masih ada beberapa bagian yang belum begitu terang bagiku untuk itu aku masih perlu minta petunjuk ouw sinshe
1201036 apa tak bisa jadi ia akan sengaja memberi petunjuk yang salah kau tidak boleh lupa bahwa ia sudah berusaha untuk meracuni aku
1201037 sebegitu jauh obat obat atau cara mengobati yang diberikan oleh ouw sinshe sangat manjur dan tepat di samping itu akupun dapat membedakan jika ia sengaja memberikan obat yang salah dan inilah justeru yang aku tidak mengerti
1201038 sesudah lewat malam ini aku sudah mengikut kie kouw kouw menyingkirkan diri karena racun dalam tubuhku tak bisa dipunahkan lebih baik aku tidak pulang ke boe tong supaya thay soe hoe dan paman paman jangan berubah hati aku akan pergi ketempat yang sepi dan mati dengan diam diam
1201039 ouw sinshe kau sudah berdiam di ouw tiap kok begini lama apa kau tidak merasa sebal mengapa kau tidak mau pergi pelesir ke tempat lain
1201040 dengan menutup jendela kereta dengan tirai supaya tidak masuk angin kau bisa pergi ke manapun juga
1201041 dunia sedemikin lebar di manapun sama saja bagaimana keadaanmu selama beberapa hari ini bagaimana dadamu apakah hawa dingin masih bergolak di tantianmu
1201042 sudahlah biarkan saja aka toh sudah tak bisa ditolong lagi
1201043 anak sekarang aku ingin memberi obat yang akan bisa menolong jiwamu
1201044 gunakanlah tong kwie wan cie seng tee tok ho dan hong hong lima macam di tengah malam minumlah obat itu cepat cepat dengan menggunakan coan san ka sebagai penuntun
1201045 dengan baik hati aku menasehati supaya kau menyingkir tapi aku berbalik di hina olehmu hm kau juga coba memberi obat yang tidak tidak kepadaku apa kau kira aku akan kena diakali
1201046 benar resep itu mengandung maksud lain dengan wan cie ia rupanya ingin menyuruh aku cie cay wan hang ingatan berada di tempat jauh atau dengan lain perkataan ia ingin aku ko hoei wan coew pergi ke tempat yang jauh ia menyebutnya seng tee tanah hidup dan tok ho hidup sendirian mungkin sekali seng tee berarti seng louw jalanan hidup dan sesudah mengambil jalanan hidup barulah aku bisa hidup sendirian apa arti hong hang menjawab angin ouw sin she maksudkan supaya aku menutup rahasia jangan sampai membocorkan angin
1201047 obat itu harus diminum cepat cepat di waktu tengah malam buta dengan menggunakan coan san ka sebagai penuntun cepat cepat tengah malam buta coan san ka apakah ouw sinshe maksudkan bahwa aku harus cepat cepat kabur di tengah malam buta dengan menembus jalanan gunung dan tidak boleh mengambil jalanan raya tak salah itulah tentu maksud yang sebenarnya
1201048 sekarangi musuh belum tiba tapi mengapa ouw sinshe tidak memberitahukan aku secara teang terangan
1201049 mengapa ia mengeluarkan kata kata itu kalau aku tidak dapat menebaknya bukankah aku bisa celaka ah sekarang sudah lewat tengah malam aku mesti menyingkir secepat mungkin
1201050 ibumu bernasib celaka kaupun jelek peruntungan mulai dari sekarang ibumu tak bisa merawatmu lagi
1201051 kie kouwkouw tempelkan ujung pedangmu di dadanya supaya dia tidak bisa berkutik aku mau menengok ouw sinshe
1201052 jangan kuatir ia sudah ditakluki dan tak akan bisa lari
1201053 lekas bawa dia kemari lekas kalau terlambat aku kuatir tak keburu lagi
1201054 tidak begini saja lebih dulu berikan padanya tiga butir goe hong hiat ciat tan ambillah dari laci ketiga lekas lekas
1201055 sekarang selain racun kaupun mendapat luka jika aku dapat menyembuhkan kita jangan menjajal jalal kepandaian lagi
1201056 tapi apakah kau tahu racun apa yang ditelan olehku jika kau bisa menyembuhkan aku aku akan mengaku kalah hm tetapi belum tentu kepandaian ie sian tabib malaikat atau tabib dewa bisa menandingi kepandaian tok sian si dewi racun
1201057 semenjak sepuluh tahun berselang aku sudah mengatakan bahwa ie sian tak akan bisa menandingi tok sian
1201058 tapi kau tak percaya kau terlalu suka menjajal ilmu aku sungguh tidak mengerti mengapa kau begitu gila sehingga kau meracuni diri sendiri sekarang aku mengharap bahwa ia sian akan menang dari tok sian jika aku gagal akupun tak sudi hidup sendirian di dalam dunia
1201059 ha ha dengan meracuni diri sendiri kau tentu akan mengeluarkan seantero kepandaianmu
1201060 hatiku sangat berkuatir sudahlah jangan kau bicara banyak banyak meramkan matamu dan mengaso tapi ingatlah kalau dengan diam diam kau mengerahkan lweekang untuk mencelakakan diri sendiri kau berbuat curang dalam pertandingan ilmu ini
1201061 dalam kebingungan aku telah berbuat kesalahan terhadapmu aku harap kau sudi memaafkan
1201062 kau adalah tuan penolongku hanya karena aku sangat memikiri keselamnatan isteriku maka aku sudah berbuat kedosaan terhadapmu
1201063 baiklah aku akan menceritakan latar belakangnya tanpa tedeng tedeng isteriku seorang she ong namanya lan kouw kami berdua adalah saudara seperguruan pada waktu kami masih berada dalam rumah perguruan di samping belajar ilmu silat aku mempelajari ilmu ketabiban sedang dia mempelajari tok soet ilmu menggunakan racun menurut pendapatnya tujuan belajar ilmu silat adalah untuk membunuh orang dan tujuan tok soet juga untuk membunuh orang boe soet ilmu silat dan tok soet merupakan dua macam ilmu yang berdiri berendeng maka itu jika seorang mahir dalam boe soet dan tok soet maka kepandaiannya bertambah dengan satu kali lipat ilmu ketabiban adalah untuk menolong manusia sehingga pada hakekatnya ilmu ketabiban dan ilmu silat bertentangan satu sama lain itulah jalan pikiran isteriku tapi karena bakatku terletak dalam ilmu ketabiban aku tak dapat mengubah kesukaan itu
1201064 meskipun apa yang dipelajari kami berdua perhubungan kami sangat erat dan di antara kami telah timbul perasaan cinta
1201065 dasar aku yang tolol yang bertindak tanpa dipikir lagi berapa kali isteriku telah meracuni orang dan orang itu telah datang kepadaku untuk meminta pertolongan tanpa memikir panjang aku segera menolong mereka pada waktu itu hatiku malah merasa senang sedikitpun aku tidak merasa bahwa tindakanku itu sangat menyinggung perasaan isteriku aku sama sekali tak ingat bahwa jika menyembuhkan orang yang diracuni olehnya maka itu berarti bahwa kepandaian ie sian adalah lebih unggul dari pada tok sian
1201066 isteriku sangat mencintai aku di dalam dunia sukar dicari tandingannya tapi aku sendiri dengan di dorong oleh napsu mau menang berulang kali aku menyinggung perasaannya cobalah kalian pikir meskipun dia patung satu waktu dia bisa habis kesabarannya akhirnya aku tersadar aku bersumpah bahwa aku tak akan menolong lagi orang yang telah diracuni olehnya lantaran begitu lama lama orang memberi gelaran kian sie poet kioe atau melihat kebinasaan tak sudi menolong padaku melihat aku berubah isterikupun merasa senang tapi baru saja beberapa tahun aku mengambil jalan yang benar muncullah peristiwa adik perempuanku
1201067 kehormatan adikku telah dilanggar oleh bangsat sian ie thong dari hwa san pay dan akhirnya binasa dalam tangannya tapi samoai pada detik mau menghembuskan napasnya yang penghabisan adikku masih mencintai bangsat itu pesannya yang terakhir supaya aku berjanji bahwa selama hidup aku akan menolongnya jika ia memerlukan pertolongan karena melihat adikku tidak akan mati dengan mata meram jika aku tidak meluluskan permintaannya maka mau tidak mau dengan hati penasaran aku terpaksa memberikan janjiku itu
1201068 di luar tahuku isteriku telah menaruh racun yang sangat hebat di badan sian ie thong racun itu yang jalannya sangat perlahan akan merusak seluruh tubuh bangsat yang sesudah menderita hebat selama tiga tahun akan mampus dengan dagingnya membusuk sian ie tong mengetahui janjiku yang diberikan kepada adikku begitu melihat keadaannya berbahaya ia segera meminta pertolongan kepadaku hai otakku benar benar pusing kalau aku menolong aku menyinggung isteri sendiri kalau tidak menolong aku melanggar janji
1201069 sian ie tong adalah ciangboenjin hwa san pay ilmu silatnya tinggi dan dalam kalangan kangouw ia dikenal sebagai seorang pendekar
1201070 sungguh tak dinyana dia sebenarnya manusia rendah ouw sinshe sesudah adikmu binasa dalam tangannya kaupun tak perlu menolong dia apa pula adikmu yang sudah meninggal dunia tidak tahu lagi urusan itu
1201071 kie kouwkouw kau salah roh seorang yang sudah meninggal dunia masih bisa mengetahui apa yang terjadi di dalam dunia
1201072 apa yang terjadi di alam baka tidak diketahui oleh manusia
1201073 pada waktu itu jalan pikiranku adalah begini jika aku berdosa terhadap isteriku di alam kemudian aku masih dapat memperbaikinya tapi jika aku melanggar janji hai selama hidupnya adikku selalu menderita bagaimana aka tega untuk menyakiti rohnya
1201074 demikianlah dengan menggunakan seluruh kepandaian aku akhirnya berhasil menyembubkan sibangsat sian ie thong
1201075 bagus kepandaian tiap kok ie sian ouw ceng goe benar benar tinggi tapi tok sian ong lan kauw tak sudi menakluk sekarang marilah kita menjajal ilmu untuk mendapat keputusan ie sian atau tok sian yang lebih tingggi mati matian aku memohon maaf tapi ia tidak meladeni
1201076 beberapa tahun isteriku memperdalami ilmunya dan telah maracuni beberapa orang kangouw yang ternama sesudah meracuni ia memberi petunjuk supaya orang orang itu datang kepadaku tok soet isteriku ternyata sudah banyak lebih lihai sehingga tempo tempo aku tidak mendapat jalan untuk mengobati orang yang kena racunnya ditambah lagi dengan rasa sungkan untuk membangkitkan amarah isteriku maka dalam menghadapi keracunan yang hebat sudah gagal satu dua kali aku menghentikan usahaku dan mengatakan saja bahwa aku tak mampu menolong lagi
1201077 tapi di luar dugaan sikapku bahkan menambah kegusarannya ia menuduh bahwa aku sudah memandang rendah kepadanya dan bahwa aku sudah sengaja tidak mau mengeluarkan seantero kepandaianku dengan gusar ia meninggalkan ouw tiap kok dan mengatakan bahwa biar apapun yang terjadi ia takkan kembali kepadaku
1201078 selama berada di luar berulang kali ia meracuni orang dan menyuruh orang orang itu datang kepadaku kependaiannya makin tinggi sehingga tempo tempo aku tak tahu siapa yang sudah meracuni penderita yang meminta pertolonganku dalam menghadapi penderita yang seperti itu dengan menganggap bahwa dia bukan diracuni oleh isteriku kadang kadang aku memberi pertolongan dan menyembuhkannya belakangan baru kutahu bahwa orang itu sebenarnya telah diracuni oleh isteriku demikianlah perhubungan kita jadi makin renggang
1201079 namaku ceng coe atau kerbau hijau sebenarnya lebih tepat jika nama itu diganti dengan kerbau tolol entah kebaikan apa yang sudah kuperbuat sehingga aku dicintai oleh seorang wanita begitu mulia seperti isteriku itu dan hanyalah karena ketololanku maka ia telah meninggalkan rumah dan hidup terlunta lunta di luaran mengingat bahayanya dunia kangouw setiap saat setiap detik hatiku selalu memikiri keselamatannya
1201080 sudah bagus kalau orang lain tidak dilanggar olehnya sungguh lucu ouw sinshe kelihatannya sangat takut pada isterinya
1201081 pada tujuh tahun berselang sepasang suami isteri yang sudah berusia lanjut kena racun hebat dan mereka datang di sini untuk meminta pertolongan mereka adalah majikan pulau leng coa to di laut tong hay mereka memiliki ilmu silat yang luar biasa dan tingkatan mereka pun tinggi sekali puluhan tahun berselang nama kim hoa popo dan gin yap sianseng menggetarkan rimba persilatan
1201082 aku tidak berani lantas menolak secara tegas tapi cobalah kalian pikir cara bagaimana aku berani membuat kesalahan lagi aku lalu memeriksa nadi mereka dan mengatakan bahwa gin yap sianseng sudah tak dapat diobati lagi sedang kim hoa popo hanya kena racun enteng dan ia akan bisa menyembuhkan dirinya dengan menggunakan lweekang sendiri aku diberitahukan bahwa yang meracuni mereka adalah seorang pek to pay partai unta putih yang sangat lihai di wilayah see hek wilayah barat dan tiada sangkut pautnya dengan isteriku tapi sesudah sesumbar bahwa selain anggauta beng kauw aku tak akan menolong orang lagi maka aku tak bisa menjilat ludah sendiri hanya karena yang minta tolong orang jempolan nyonya tua itu memohon mohon supaya aku suka menolong seorang saja yaitu suaminya dan untuk itu ia menjanjikan hadiah yang sangat besar kalian harus mengetahui bahwa di dalam rimba persilatan gin yap sian seng dan kim hoa popo sangat cemerlang dan bahwa mereka sudah mau membuka mulut untuk meminta pertolonganku bagiku sudah merupakan muka yang sangat besar kehormatan besar tapi demi kepentingan kami berdua suami isteri aku tetap tidak mau menolong
1201083 untung juga mereka tidak menggunakan kekerasan sesudah yakin tak ada harapan mereka pergi dengan perasaan duka aku mengerti bahwa karena penolakan penolakanku untuk mengobati orang aku sudah menanam banyak bibit perm suhan tapi kecintaan dan kerukunan antara aku dan isteriku masih lebih panting daripada kepentingan orang lain bagaimana pendapat kalian bukankah pendirian itu pendirian benar
1201084 waktu gie coen datang ke sini paling belakang ia mengatakan bahwa di tengah jalan dia bertemu dengan seorang nenek yang memberitahukan bahwa sesuai dengan dugaanku gin yap sian seng sudah meninggal dunia karena racun itu sesudah gie coen berlalu isteriku mendadak pulang melihat boe kie ia segera menggunakan bie yo obat tidur sehingga saudara kecil pulas nyenyak semalam suntuk
1201085 pulangnya isteriku tentu saja sangat menggirangkan iapun sudah mendengar bahwa kim hoa popo telah datang lagi di tiong goan sehingga biarpun masih mendongkol terhadapku buru buru ia pulang untuk memberitahukan hal itu kepadaku atas kemauannya aku berpura pura sakit cacar dan menolak untuk menemui orang kami mengunci diri di dalam kamar dan memikiri siasat untuk menghadapi kim hoa popo ilmu silat nyonya tua itu terlalu lihai sehingga tak mungkin kami melarikan diri tapi ia mempunyai adat yang aneh jika ia ingin membunuh seseorang serangannya dibatasi dalam tiga kali kalau orang itu bisa menyelamatkan diri dari ke tiga tiga kali serangannya maka ia akan mengampuninya
1201086 selang beberapa hari kemudian datanglah sie kong wan kan ciat kau sendiri kie kouwnio dan yang lain lainnya sampai lima belas orang
1201087 begitu mendengar luka kalian aku segera mengetahui bahwa kim hoa popo sengaja mau mencoba coba aku apakah aku masih tetap pada pendirianku yaitu tidak mau menolong siapapun jua kecuali murid beng kauw luka kelima belas orang itu rata rata luka yang sangat aneh aku adalah seorang yang keranjingan ilmu ketabiban begitu melihat luka atau penyakit aneh tanganku lantas saja gatal dan ingin menjajal kepandaianku sekarang kim hoa popo mengirim bukan satu tapi lima belas orang kalian dapatlah membayangkan perasaanku tapi akupun mengerti maksud nenek itu jika ada seseorang saja yang diobati olehku celakalah aku ia pasti akan menyiksa aku ratusan kali lipat lebih hebat daripada orang yang diobati itu lantaran begitu sambil menahan keinginan hati aku tetap berpeluk tangan belakangan sesudah boe kie menanyakan pendapatku andaikata orang yang terluka adalah seorang murid beng kauw barulah aku memberi petunjuk tapi aku sangat berhati hati dan sengaja menerangkan bahwa boe kie adalah murid boe tong pay dan tidak bersangkut paut dengan diriku
1201088 melihat bahwa dengan pertolongan boe kie orang orang itu mulai sembuh dengan cepat lan houw kembali merasa tidak senang setiap malam diam diam ia menaruh racun di piring mangkok mereka dengan demikian lagi lagi ia bermaksud untuk mengadu kepandaian denganku kelimabelas orang itu rata rata adalah jago jago rimba persilatan bagaimana ia bisa menyateroni tanpa diketahui sebelum menyebar racun lebih dulu ia menggunakan obat tidur
1201089 selama beberapa hari ini kesehatan kie kouw nio pulih dengan cepat seperti juga racun isteriku tidak mempan lagi
1201090 sesudah menyelidiki ia mengerti bahwa rahasianya sudah diketahui boe kie maka ia segera mengambil keputusan untuk mengambil jiwa boe kie hai kata orang sungai dan gunung lebih mudah diubah daripada adat manusia aku harus mengakui bahwa aku ouw ceng goe tidak cukup setia kepada isteriku sebenarnya aku sudah mengambil keputusan uatuk berpeluk tangan tapi karena boe kie telah menasehati aku supaya aku menyingkir ke tempat lain maka hatiku lantas saja menjadi lemah aku segera memberi resep istimewa padanya dengan menyebutkan tong wie wan sie tok ho dan beberapa macam obat lain aku tidak dapat bicara terus terang karena tan kouw berada di samping ku
1201091 tapi isteriku adalah seorang yang sangat cerdas dan juga mengenal ilmu ketabiban
1201092 aku dan kau sudah menjadi suami isteri selama dua puluh tahun lebih lautan bisa kering batu bisa hanceur tapi kecintaan kita tak akan bisa berubah tapi kau selamanya memandang rendah kepada tok toet ku setiap orang yang diracuni oleh ku selalu dapat di tolong olehmu sekarang aku sendiri menelan racun jika kau dapat menolong jiwaku aku takluk terhadapmu bukan main rasa kagetku berulang ulang aku minta ampun dan mengaku kalah tapi ia lalu menyumbat mulutku dengan buah tho sehingga aku tidak dapat bicara lagi kejadian selanjutnya sudah diketahui kalian hai boe kie kau berdosa terhadapku kau membalas kebaikan dengan kejahatan aku menasehati kau untuk menyingkirkan tapi kau berbalik melukai isteriku yang tercinta
1201093 cobalah kalian pikir apa yang harus diperbuat olehku kalau sekarang aku berhasil menyembuhkannya itu akan berarti bahwa kepandaianku lebih unggul dari pada kepandaiannya dan lan kouw tentu akan tetap merasa kurang senang jika aku gagal jiwanya melayang hai aku mengharap kim hoa popo cepat cepat datang supaya aku lekas lekas mampus agar jangan merasakan penderitaan ini lebih lama lagi
1201094 selama beberapa tahun kepandaian isteriku sudah maju jauh sehingga aku tidak dapat menebak racun apa yang ditelannya
1201095 tapi aku mengenal adatnya biarpun mati ia tak nanti memberitahukan kepada kita
1201096 kau telanlah sam ciong sam co sesudah kau meracuni diri sendiri aku yang akan menolong
1201097 tapi karena tak ada lain jalan biarlah aku mencoba secara untung untungan
1201098 ouw sinshe dengan memiliki kepandaian yang begitu tinggi apakah bisa jadi kau tak tahu racun apa yang sudah ditelan soebo
1201099 menurut dugaanku ia telah menelan racun sam ciong sam co
1201100 kalian pergilah manakala lan kouw binasa akupun tak bisa hidup sendirian di dalam dunia
1201101 kami harap sinshe bisa menyayang diri dan coba membujuk soebo
1201102 kalau dia bisa dibujuk kejadian hari ini boleh tak usah terjadi
1201103 suamimu tak mempunyai kemampuan dan tak dapat memunahkan racun sam ciong sam co jalan satu satunya ialah mengikuti kau ke dunia baka untuk menyambung perjodohan kita
1201104 kau gila mengapa begitu banyak racun sebanyak itu dapat membinasakan tiga manusia
1201105 tapi kau sendiri tak hentinya mengajak aku mengadu ilmu aku merasa hidup lebih lama tiada artinya aduh aduh ia bukan berpura pura ketika itu racun ular dan lawa lawa sudah mulai menyerang jantung badannya bergoyang goyang dan dilain detik ia sudah tak ingat orang
1201106 akulah yang bersalah kau tidak boleh mati aku tak akan mengajak kau mengadu ilmu lagi
1201107 lekas ambil jarum emas dan tusuklah jalan darah yong coan hiat dan kioe bwee hiat dan cepat
1201108 saudara kecil kau adalah tuan penolong kami yang sudah menolong jiwa kami berdua
1201109 kim hoa popo yang menduga kalian pasti akan binasa sudah berlalu tanpa mengatakan sepatah kata
1201110 kim hoa popo adaiah seorang yang sangat berhati hati biarpun hari ini ia sudah pergi di lain hari ia pasti akan datang pula untuk menyelidiki kami berdua harus menyingkirkan diri saudara kecil aku ingin meminta pertolonganmu buatlah dua buah kuburan kosong dan tulisilah nama kami di atas batu nisan
1201111 boe kie semua pelajaranku sudah tercatat dalam buku ini aku menghadiahkannya kepadamu aku merasa sangat menyesal bahwa racun hian beng sin ciang dalam tubuhmu masih belum dapat disingkirkan aku mengharap bahwa sesudah mempelajari buku ini kau sendiri akan mendapat jalan untuk mempunah racun itu dengan berkah tuhan di hari kemudian kita masih bisa bertemu lagi
1201112 kau bukan saja sudah menolong jiwa kami tapi juga sudah mengakurkan kami berdua suami isteri menurut pantas akupun harus memberikan semua pelajaran kepadamu hanya sayang apa yang dipelajari olehku ada ilmu ilmu meracuni manusia yang tiada faedahnya aku hanya dapat memohon pada tuhan yang maha esa supaya kau sembuh dalam tempo agar di hari kemudian aku masih bisa membalas sedikit budimu
1201113 orang itu menyamar seperti seorang perwira mongol aku tak tahu siapa adanya dia aku datang kemari untuk meminta pertolongan ouw sinshe tapi ia tak sudi menolong sekarang ia meninggal dunia dan penyakitku tentu tak dapat diobati lagi itulah sebabnya mengapa aku menangis
1201114 mati atau hidup tak bisa diminta secara paksa apakah seseorang yang serakah yang ingin hidup terus menerus bukan seorang yang sedang mabuk entahlah apakah seseorang yang takut mati bukan seperti seorang kanak kanak yang kesasar dan tidak mengenal jalan pulang entahlah apakah seseorang yang sudah meninggal dunia tidak merasa menyesal bahwa ia dahulu ingin sekali dilahirkan di dalam dunia inipun tak diketahui olehku
1201115 apakah kebinasaan suami itu bukan kejadian yang tidak terlalu jelek
1201116 soal mati atau hidup tak bisa diketahui manusia biarpun kematian belum tentu merupakan suatu kejadian yang menakuti tapi pada umumnya manusia takut mati benar manusia tidak bisa meminta secara paksa pada akhirnya satu hari semua manusia akan mati akan tetapi jika bisa hidup satu hari lebih lama orang lebih suka hidup satu hari lebih lama
1201117 menurut pendapatku orang itu melukakan kau dengan hian beng sin ciang karena dia ingin memaksa kau memberitahukan tempat sembunyinya cia soen bukankah begitu
1201118 dia telah menyiksa aku dengan berbagai cara tapi aku tetap membungkam
1201119 tapi biar bagaimanapun jua aku tak akan memberitahukan kepada siapapun jua
1201120 beritahukanlah di mana adanya cia soen sesudah kau memberitahukan aku akan mengusir racun dari tubuhmu dan juga akan memberikan semacam ilmu silat yang tiada duanya kepadamu
1201121 kedua orang tuaku telah mengorbankan jiwa karena tidak mau menjual sahabat
1201122 there are things that go bump in the night make no mistake about that and we are the people who bump back
1201123 if that gandalf the great fellow is such a great wizard how come he doesnt just conjure up a bazooka and shoot that flying thing out of the sky
1201124 gak siansing kau pun boleh pergi saja tentang jenazah istrimu apakah akan kau bawa pulang ke hoa san untuk dikebumikan di sana
1201125 baiklah kalau begitu tempat kita ini sudah diketahui orang kupikir dua tiga hari lagi kita harus pindah tempat
1201126 ini adalah pi sia kiam boh yang mengakibatkan hoa san pay kalian kocar kacir sungguh suatu bibit bencana
1201127 pada dasarnya suhu adalah orang baik tapi demi untuk meyakinkan ilmu pedang sesat ini akhirnya sifatnya berubah lain sama sekali
1201128 kalau kiam boh ini tetap beredar di dunia kang ouw sungguh akan menimbulkan malapetaka yang tak terhingga kita sudah membakar sejilid kiam boh ini tapi lim peng ci masih memegang kiam boh yang asli cuma kukira dia takkan seluruhnya diuraikan kepada co leng tan dan lo tek nau anak she lim itu pun bukan orang bodoh mana dia mau memberikan kiam boh berharga itu kepada orang lain
1201129 mata co leng tan dan lim peng ci sudah buta semua bila benar lim peng ci mau mengajarkan ilmu pedang itu paling paling hanya bisa mengajar dengan uraian mulut saja tidak mungkin kiam boh itu ditulis kembali tapi lo tek nau tidak buta dia yang akan mendapat keuntungan ketiga orang itu adalah manusia manusia licik dan licin mereka berkumpul menjadi satu tentu juga tidak terhindar dari pertarungan tipu menipu akhirnya entah bagaimana jadinya cuma dua lawan satu mungkin lim peng ci akan kecundang
1201130 apakah kau benar benar akan berusaha membela lim peng ci
1201131 tidak seharusnya aku menyanggupi kepada siausumoay akan membela lim peng ci orang ini lebih kejam daripada binatang pantasnya kucincang tubuhnya hingga hancur luluh mana aku akan membantu dia pula hanya saja aku sudah berjanji kepada siausumoay bila aku ingkar janji di alam baka tentu dia takkan tenteram
1201132 ketika masih hidup dia tidak tahu siapakah yang benar benar baik padanya sesudah di alam baka seharusnya dia tahu
1201133 maka dia tentu pula tidak menginginkan kau melindungi lim peng ci
1201134 cinta siausumoay terhadap peng ci sudah terlalu mendalam biarpun tahu ia sendiri dibunuh oleh suaminya itu toh tidak tega membiarkan hidup suaminya merana dalam keadaan buta
1201135 tidak salah juga ucapanmu ini seumpama aku tidak peduli bagaimana sikapmu terhadap diriku toh aku akan tetap mencintai kau dengan segenap jiwa ragaku
1201136 lalu urusan lim peng ci itu cara bagaimana kau akan bertanggung jawab terhadap mendiang siausumoaymu
1201137 tapi sebaiknya jangan kau singgung singgung dahulu biarlah kulakukan menurut keadaan saja
1201138 kita telah tinggal sekian lamanya di hing san maka dapat dikatakan kita pernah menjadi orang hing san pay pula sekarang kita harus kembali ke sana untuk menggempur hing san pay cara bagaimana kita akan bicara bila ketemu lenghou kongcu
1201139 thio hujin kau orang perempuan memang suka ragu ragu meski kita pernah tinggal di paviliun hing san tapi kita kan bukan nikoh mana dapat dikatakan orang hing san pay lenghou kongcu selamanya tiada hubungan apa apa dengan kita sebabnya kita mau menjunjung dia adalah karena terdorong oleh hormat kita kepada seng koh padahal sekarang kabarnya seng koh sudah marah dan putus hubungan dengan dia lantaran lenghou tiong memerkosa serta membunuh nona gak dari hoa san pay itu
1201140 kabar di kalangan kang ouw kebanyakan adalah omong kosong belaka buktinya hing san pay banyak anak murid yang muda lagi cantik sedikit pun lenghou tiong tidak pernah bertingkah buruk masakah dia malah memerkosa nona gak apalagi seng koh berpuluh kali lebih cantik daripada nona gak sedemikian mendalam seng koh jatuh cinta padanya maka berita bohong itu sesungguhnya cuma bikin kotor telinga saja
1201141 watak kaum lelaki kalau punya satu ingin punya dua punya dua ingin punya empat biarpun seng koh secantik bidadari juga sukar menjamin takkan timbul minat lenghou tiong terhadap perempuan lain
1201142 tak peduli apa katamu yang jelas suruh aku membunuhi anak buah lenghou tiong aku pasti tidak mau
1201143 cuma kau jangan lupa gak siansing memegang hek bok leng medali kayu hitam tanda perintah yim kaucu resminya dia ketua ngo gak pay tapi diam diam dia sudah masuk tiau yang sin kau dia memberi tugas kepada kita justru karena mendapat perintah dari yim kaucu
1201144 ia pun berjanji akan mengajarkan pi sia kiam hoat kepada kita bilamana tugas kita sudah selesai
1201145 gak siansing terkenal dengan julukan kun cu kiam kukira tidak mungkin dia ingkar janji masakah dia tidak sayang kepada julukannya yang diperolehnya dengan susah payah selama berpuluh tahun
1201146 jika begitu baiklah kita ada rezeki dibagi rata ada kesukaran dipikul bersama
1201147 tentang lenghou tiong tak peduli apakah dia benar memerkosa dan membunuh nona gak atau tidak sekalipun seng koh suka padanya betapa pun dia adalah orang tiau yang sin kau juga masakah dia berani membangkang terhadap hek bok leng sang kaucu kalau kita sudah tumpas hing san pay andaikan dia tidak terima boleh dia bicara dengan yim kaucu dan gak siansing
1201148 menurut gak siansing katanya orang orang yang dikirim ke hing san telah diteliti dan dipilih dengan baik jadi tidak setiap teman kita yang pernah tinggal di hing san mendapatkan tugas ini
1201149 saat ini rombongan rombongan yang berangkat lebih dulu agaknya sudah sampai di hing san
1201150 jika setiap orang dikirim ke sana dan setiap orang diberi ajaran pi sia kiam hoat maka ilmu pedang ini tentu tidak menarik lagi
1201151 ya memang tidak begitu menurut gak siansing setelah usaha kita berhasil pi sia kiam hoat itu hanya diajarkan kepada kita bertujuh serta hoat put liu jiu yu siok selain kedelapan orang ini tiada seorang pun yang mendapat bagian lagi maka kita diharuskan menutup mulut supaya orang lain tidak iri
1201152 aneh hoat put liu jiu yu siok yang sok itu mengapa gak siansing justru penujui dia
1201153 bisa jadi yu siok itu pintar bicara yang manis manis sehingga gak siansing tertarik bisa pula lantaran dia pernah berjasa sesuatu bagi gak siansing
1201154 mereka mengatakan guruku memegang hek bok leng dan menugaskan mereka membasmi hing san pay apakah mungkin dalam beberapa hari ini suhu telah menggabung kepada tiau yang sin kau ah rasanya tidak mungkin o ya pau tay coh itu membawa hek bok leng tampaknya di tengah jalan dia telah dibunuh oleh suhu sehingga hek bok leng itu terampas karena tertawan dan mendapat siksaan di lembah itu tempo hari sudah tentu suhu sangat dendam maka untuk melampiaskan dendam dan untuk melenyapkan saksi begitu meninggalkan lembah pegunungan itu suhu lantas membinasakan pau tay coh dan kawan kawannya bila aku sendiri yang menghadapi keadaan demikian tentu juga akan berbuat cara sama dengan membunuh mereka
1201155 lantas sebab apa suhu hendak menumpas hing san pay ya mungkin dia dendam padaku tapi tidak mampu melawan aku pada saat aku belum sembuh dari luka parah sekaligus ia hendak menghancurkan hing san pay untuk menjatuhkan pula namaku dia telah dicekoki pil maut oleh ing ing selama hidup selanjutnya berarti berada di bawah cengkeraman seorang nona cilik lalu apa artinya menjadi manusia demikian mungkin ia menjadi nekat karena dia sekarang tinggal sebatang kara daripada hidup tersiksa ada lebih baik membunuh diri saja tapi sebelumnya dia ingin menghancurkan hing san pay lebih dulu sekadar pelampias dendam
1201156 jika kuberi tahukan hal ini kepada ing ing tentu dia akan gusar dan takkan memberi obat penawar kepada suhu jalan yang paling baik adalah mengenyahkan dulu kawanan penyusup ini dari hing san habis itu baru mencari akal untuk melayani suhu
1201157 jika kau tidak mau aku akan tangkap dan paksa kau
1201158 eh ing ing ketika di lembah gunung tempo hari tiba tiba kupikir kelak bila kita sudah kawin paling baik kita punya berapa orang anak menghadapi tho kok lembah tho di sana itu aku menjadi terbayang bilamana kelak lahir enam tho kok lak sian kecil kan sangat menarik
1201159 kita bersama sama menuju ke hing san orang orang yang berpikiran kotor jangan jangan akan mengira kita sudah kawin sehingga sembarangan omong hal ini tentu akan membikin marah padamu
1201160 benar syukur kita sekarang sudah menyamar begini orang lain tentu tak dapat mengenali kita lagi
1201161 kau terlalu cantik betapa pun menyamar juga tetap menarik perhatian orang
1201162 menurut pendapatku setiba di hing san sebaiknya aku tidak muncul dulu tapi menyaru seorang yang tidak menarik untuk menyelidiki keadaan di sana jika keadaan hing san aman sentosa maka aku akan perlihatkan diri dan menyerahkan kedudukan ketua kepada orang lain habis itu kita bertemu lagi di suatu tempat yang dirahasiakan untuk kemudian pergi dari sana tanpa diketahui siapa pun
1201163 baiklah cuma untuk menemui para suthay di hing san sana agar tidak mencolok paling baik kalau kau pun cukur rambut dan menyaru menjadi suthay tanggung orang takkan curiga eh tampaknya kau akan sangat cantik juga bila menyamar sebagai nikoh cilik hayolah engkoh tiong coba kudandani kau
1201164 jangan jangan setiap kali melihat nikoh setiap kali pula kalah judi bila aku menyamar sebagai nikoh tentu akan sial selamanya aku tidak mau cuma untuk menghindarkan perhatian memang perlu aku menyaru sebagai orang perempuan tapi sekali aku membuka suara tentu pula akan ketahuan maka paling baik aku menyamar seorang bisu tuli apakah kau masih ingat kepada seorang yang tinggal di sian kong si itu biara yang dibangun terapung di antara dua puncak di belakang kian seng hong di hing san itu
1201165 aha bagus sekali memang di sian kong si itu ada seorang babu tua bisu lagi tuli kita pernah bertempur sengit di sana tapi perempuan tua itu sedikit pun tidak dengar kita tanya padanya dia juga cuma melongo saja tak bisa menjawab apakah kau ingin menyamar sebagai dia
1201166 baiklah mari kita pergi membeli pakaian segera aku mendandani kau
1201167 nah luarnya sudah berubah hanya tingkah lakumu masih perlu dilatih kau harus berlagak bodoh berlagak tolol macam orang linglung yang paling penting bila ada orang mendadak menggertak di belakangmu jangan sekali kali kau melonjak terkejut sehingga rahasia penyamaranmu terbongkar
1201168 berlagak tolol bagiku adalah hal paling gampang pura pura bodoh memangnya adalah keahlianku
1201169 musuh sudah datang apakah siu siong lian dan rombongannya sudah mulai bergerak
1201170 siausumoay mungkin sudah lelah silakan pergi tidur saja bersama the sumoay besok boleh berlatih pula
1201171 kulihat hati siausumoay selalu tak bisa tenang hati yang kacau dan pikiran tergoda adalah pantangan besar bagi orang beribadat seperti kita ini entah cara bagaimana kita harus menasihatkan dia
1201172 aku tahu apa sebabnya hati siausumoay tak bisa tenang yang senantiasa terkenang olehnya adalah
1201173 di tempat suci ini hendaklah suci jangan bicara hal hal demikian
1201174 sebenarnya tiada halangannya membiarkan siausumoay insaf sendiri bilamana kita tidak buru buru ingin menuntut balas sakit hati suhu
1201175 dahulu suhu sering mengatakan bahwa segala apa di dunia ini sudah suratan takdir harus mengikuti menurut apa adanya sedikit pun tak boleh dipaksakan kulihat siausumoay adalah orang yang berperasaan sebenarnya dia tidak cocok memasuki dunia agama seperti kita ini
1201176 aku pun pernah memikirkan soal ini cuma saja hing san pay pada akhirnya harus ada seorang dari kalangan agama kita sendiri untuk memegang jabatan ketua lenghou suheng sudah berulang ulang menyatakan bahwa dia hanya sementara saja menjabat ciangbunjin kita tapi yang terpenting adalah keparat gak put kun itu telah mencelakai suhu dan susiok
1201177 kalau sakit hati mahabesar ini tidak lekas kita balas kita sebagai anak murid beliau beliau itu tentu tidak nyenyak tidur dan tidak enak makan
1201178 tidak cuma kau saja yang tidak sabar mungkin aku lebih gelisah daripada kau tentang pembalasan sakit hati guru kita
1201179 ah aku seharusnya memikirkan hal ini sejak dulu dulu mengapa mereka sudah lama mengetahui hal ini sebaliknya hal ini tak pernah kupikirkan
1201180 tatkala mana tonghong put pay sudah mati orang yang mampu membinasakan kedua suthay dengan sebatang jarum kecil hanya orang yang telah berhasil meyakinkan kui hoa po tian atau pi sia kiam hoat sedangkan pi sia kiam hoat yang diyakinkan co leng tan itu adalah palsu tidak sempurna selain itu hanya guruku dan lim peng ci saja berdua sedangkan waktu itu lim peng ci baru saja memperoleh pi sia kiam hoat belum lagi berhasil meyakinkannya ini terbukti waktu bertemu dengan lim peng ci sesudah meninggalkan siau lim si dahulu suara peng ci belum lagi banci
1201181 engko ceng menghadapi tua bangka ini jangan kau sungkan sungkan
1201182 itulah pukulan yang tidak ada keanehannya itulah jurus ke delapan yang dinamakan burung belibis tunggal keluar dari rombongannya dari tipu silat thong pek liok hap ciang
1201183 dia dapat menghajar kursi itulah sebab tenaganya yang besar ilmu silatnya hanya biasa saja
1201184 kaulah si jago tua tangan besi marilah kau pukul pula aku satu kali lagi
1201185 tua bangka ini berkepandaian biasa saja dia tidak menghajar aku tidak apa setelah ia menghajar terbukalah rahasianya

1201196 dulu aku mencaci kau tidak punya semangat sekarang tetap aku mencaci kau tidak mempunyai semangat berulangkali kau mengajak orang membikin susah kami suami istri kau membuatnya kami tidak punya tempat untuk menyembunyikan diri karenanya kami menjadi menderita sangat di gurun di mongolia sekarang bukannya kau berdaya untuk membalas sakit hati suhu kau repot hendak membuat perhitungan denganku kau menangis saja tidak karuan mari kita mencari coan cin cit cu untuk mencari balas jikalau kau tidak kuat jalan nanti aku gendong padamu

1201203 ini kiu locianpwee paling suka memperdayakan orang kata katanya belum tentu harum wangi
1201204 mungkin ini disebabkan urusan ciu pek thong pamannya khu totiang beramai
1201205 biar bagaimana aku percaya kata kata orang tua bangka ini berbau busuk
1201206 jie suhu bata ini terbuat dari tepung tadi dia memencetnya dengan menggunai ilmu tenaga dalamnya yang lihay sekali
1201207 coba kau sulut rumput itu dan kau masuki ke dalam tangan bajumu lalu kau menyedot dan meniupnya keluar
1201208 engko ceng lihat bukankah begini caranya si tua bangka ini memainkan tenaga dalamnya
1201209 kau bilang sebenarnya ayahku mati atau tidak jikalau kau bilang benar mati aku menghendaki jiwamu
1201210 kau bilang guruku dibinasakan coan cin cit cu kau melihat dengan mata sendiri atau hanya mendapat dengar cerita orang
1201211 di sana kita mengadu kepandaian dia kalah dengan tidak disengaja dia mengatakannya
1201212 pada sebulan yang laku itu terang terangan ang cit kong ada bersama sama aku dan engko ceng ini eh engko ceng kau hajarlah dia dengan satu tanganmu lagi
1201213 kau menjunjung jambangan besi kau jalan di air ilmu apakah itu

1201219 seng hong kau merdekakan muridku dengan memandang kepada guru kita urusan dahulu hari itu suka aku tidak menimbulkannya pula
1201220 dia telah kematian suaminya matanya sendiri buta sekarang dia hidup sebatang kara aku sendiri walaupun kakiku bercacad aku ada punya istri dan anak aku ada punya rumah tangga aku masih menang berlipat kali daripadanya kita pun sama sama sudah berusia limapuluh lebih untuk apa masih memikirkan sakit hati lama
1201221 pergi kau bawa muridmu bwee suci besok pagi hendak aku pergi ke tho hoa to untuk menjenguk suhu kau mau turut atau tidak
1201222 tanpa perkenaan suhu kita lancang mendatangi tho hoa to itulah memang satu pelanggaran besar
1201223 akan tetapi si tua bangka barusan sudah mengaco belo hatiku tetap tidak tenang ingin aku menjenguknya
1201224 marilah kita pergi beramai menjenguk ayahku di sana aku nanti memohonkan keampunan bagi kamu

1201253 a huge dump of worn out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves
1201254 meritorious or as unjustly closed out from the ranks of the meritorious
1201255 these vulnerable constituencies did not need too much political coaxing to bite the hand that had slapped them in the face
1201256 well be back with more civil discussion after these messages
1201257 obama is bipartisan so long as that means asking republicans to take incremental steps toward his own broader goals
1201258 when it comes to compromising with the other side however obama says take a hike
1201259 the real obama fundamentally he is a big government redistributionist
1201260 what they portray is a barack obama sharply at variance with the image of the post racial post ideological bipartisan culture war shunning politician familiar from current media coverage and purveyed by the obama campaign as details of obamas early political career emerge into the light his associations with such radical figures as reverend jeremiah wright father michael pfleger reverend james meeks bill ayers and bernardine dohrn look less like peculiar instances of personal misjudgment and more like intentional political partnerships at his core in other words the politician chronicled here is profoundly race conscious exceedingly liberal free spending even in the face of looming state budget deficits and partisan elected president this man would presumably shift the country sharply to the left on all the key issues of the day culture war issues included its no wonder obama has passed o ver his springfield years in relative silence
1201261 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
1201262 this is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously whether human or nonhuman its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
1201263 we must not allow a violent minority to dictate the future of medicine
1201264 these are people who want to do violence and they cloak themselves in this kind of moral stance
1201265 this behavior is at odds with the core values of respect and compassion that we espouse in our work at the humane society
1201266 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1201267 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1201268 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist
1201269 from the point of view of the government department the department of justice it saves us some time and money as well because were not dealing with more than 100 foi application a year
1201270 you can actually get on the map you can see where they are so its giving the public a lot more information
1201271 you can see where the cameras are and secondly if you are a person whos been detected and you believe that you werent speeding and you want to check that the camera has actually been serviced and is accurate all of that information now is available free without having to go to foi
1201272 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1201273 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1201274 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1201275 one thing i would say about it is this we have the opportunity with the carbon pollution reduction scheme as proposed by the government to get on the path to reducing emissions
1201276 were going to have somewhere between 16 and 20 kids this year
1201277 our numbers are down a little bit but thats a good thing hopefully and hopefully fire prevention is working
1201278 weve always had the support the last couple of years but it seems the last couple of years it has picked up i know for non profit organizations fundraising is getting extremely hard there are so many good organizations out there trying to raise money for so many good causes for us to actually be picking up the last couple of years were being recognized for what were doing and its rewarding
1201279 the last couple of years weve actually gone above that ratio
1201280 there is a lot of work to keep the camp going and if people are good enough to volunteer their time to come out and help just because the numbers are down a little bit you hate to turn somebody away
1201281 every year we get more applications from people wanting to come to join the organization and sadly the last couple of years we just couldnt take on any more staff
1201282 at least three maybe four are children who have come up through the ranks and have been with us eight nine 10 years and are 18 and 19 years old and are coming back now as junior staff
1201283 its rewarding to have these kids back again and the younger kids see the adult burn survivors on staff and they see the ones who have come up through the ranks with them so there is no pressure
1201284 homeowners are responsible for the cost of the digging on our property everything else the grinder and electrical is provided by the cbrm cape breton regional municipality there are no headaches for the homeowner
1201285 i was the first one so obviously there were a few obstacles that had to be worked out but it has been up and running since sunday with no problems
1201286 for me this was a drop in the bucket compared to a 30 000 septic system i would have had to install
1201287 everything works so great now i am on the moon
1201288 i am very pleased the people of new victoria have the option for this sewer system instead of having to worry about a septic system
1201289 donna played a big part she worked very hard on this kevin macdonald director of engineering for the cbrm was also instrumental in seeing this got done
1201290 this is also possible because of the other two levels of government coming on without that assistance this project would have been very difficult
1201291 the language of school design design patterns for 21st century schools
1201292 now we just sit and wait theres so much rain i have no doubt that theres probably a little bit of water getting underneath the outfield i figure will dry pretty fast our concern would be softness of the base paths its got to stop raining first and then we can take a good look at it and see what our situation is
1201293 yeah they want to be playing ball but they made some new friends so theyre out doing things for the adults its a little more stressful
1201294 the little teddy bears dont have to put their little raincoats on to come to the picnic
1201295 for the events that the committee and department have organized weve got indoor venues
1201296 we feel a little challenged and a little soggy from being wet but youve got to just roll with the punches
1201297 it had to be postponed just in terms of the weather warnings
1201298 it was free admission to the park and a free picnic which was hamburgers and hotdogs and chips and pop but it just couldnt happen
1201299 theres several spots theres flooding ingonish harbour wreck cove those areas

1201319 the shocking figures from this research show that despite the increasing risk to homes in the uk particularly from flooding people are simply not taking the need to have adequate contents insurance seriously enough the insurance industry needs to do more to highlight the financial risk people are taking by not having enough cover
1201320 having enough cover for your insurance is obviously a good first step but what happens if you need to make a claim it seems that even many of those who do have enough contents cover would struggle to find the receipts or know what possessions had been lost in the event of a flood or fire

1201325 google have always consider the end user first and this is particularly true in the case of video ads they are not intrusive because the user can decide to view them or not they also provide an additional content source for website owners who displays them people actually want to see good ads but the advertiser also gets a great deal potential customers can view the video are exposed to the message and the advertiser isnt charged anything until they click that means powerful ads that are extremely cost effective
1201326 large corporations will probably use these ads as a part of a larger multi media advertising campaign however smes and smbs can use them to develop a presence on the net that would be out of reach with any other media whats more the audience can be carefully targeted so that the spend goes further we have an example of one of those ads at www wclass com

1201355 capres saya kira cukup mampu membaca dan menulis kalau dipatok dengan pendidikan sma lebih realistis gelar phd itu kan gelar akademik bukan gelar kepemimpinan
1201356 capres phd yang tidak dikenal masyarakat akan kalah populer dengan capres yang hanya lulusan sma yang dikenal masyarakat
1201357 jadi harus hati hati karena tingginya pendidikan tidak menjamin seseorang mempunyai kemampuan memimpin saya kenal dengan banyak orang yang bergelar si tetapi kemampuan memimpin organisasi lebih baik dengan orang yang bergelar s3 orang yang berpendidikan sma juga lebih punya wawasan yang luas ketimbang orang yang bergelar s3 sekalipun
1201358 we retain a lot more of control that we would if we were signed direct to universal
1201359 we deal with all the creative side of our music and thats all done through us in melbourne rather than through studios that universal has booked out we deliver them our music finished and done and thats how we want it to sound
1201360 and weve been with him for a little while now
1201361 it was the end of year 11 when we went into the studio to do the first round of songs for the album
1201362 we didnt know if theyd be on the album we just went in to do five tracks that we could use as an introduction for the music industry but when we were in the studio our sound got really distinct and we worked out how we wanted to be and how we were going to perform on stage
1201363 it defines who we are and our image and it just fits perfectly i dont even listen to it and go oh who are we its all very distinctive and its all very different from your average pop
1201364 people are going to generalise when they see two young girls
1201365 and theyre very distinct in their twin two girl ness people are always going to draw that comparison and thats fine but were just trying to get across that we are quite different and we do have a different sound of music me and josie dont in any way try to be like each other were different people and we dont have the same personality and it just happens that we work really well together and our music works really well together

1201378 no longer be forced to pay the high fares of the incumbent airlines and will benefit not only from tigers low fares but also from more choice in terms of destinations
1201379 once again the south australian government and adelaide airport have shown that they understand the benefits of true low fare aviation competition to the tourism industry as well as the winder state economy
1201380 all of these things will get worked out when we know the situation in september
1201381 we may need to look at restrictions again but adelaide is working well on the current level three restrictions
1201382 we gave an undertaking to talk to the people involved before making any announcement
1201383 i would say the government is not giving us the full story
1201384 the triggers for this decision were reached some time ago

1201389 what is hard to get our hands around is the ripple effect of the enormous amount of personnel time that is going into preparation for the rnc
1201390 im having a real hard time figuring out how we could be over budget significantly this year
1201391 we may not be able to get this answer today but we better get it relatively quickly
1201392 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1201393 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1201394 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75 calonge said
1201395 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1201396 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1201397 people say whats the harm in screening in fact there are several ways in which screening can actually be harmful
1201398 if therapy isnt providing meaningful benefit then how could screening provide benefit
1201399 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives
1201400 men are living a lot longer and healthier these days i play golf with 84 year old guys who beat me all the time
1201401 you have to individualize treatment if a 75 year old man is found to have high grade prostate cancer its going to kill him and we can intervene and do something for him
1201402 if it turns out that psa screening and aggressive treatment saves lives maybe all the harm that it has caused is worth it
1201403 if psa screening does not save lives then its clearly not worth it we just dont know yet
1201404 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1201405 mr foley says were on the verge of an unprecedented resources boom

1201416 he said he wanted an assurance that we would be getting a world class item this week
1201417 the problem from our perspective has not been an absence of information going into the pakistani government
1201418 they have struck like this many times we are trying to convince them to share information
1201419 then we can hit such targets ourselves otherwise its a violation and nobody in pakistan will like it
1201420 it wont cost much but we dont have the gadgets
1201421 nonmilitants who throw down their arms and come into the mainstream
1201422 when all these things dont work we have to have action

1201425 al qaeda had huge aims an aim to literally take down the west to kill thousands and they have to create economic havoc and they have and they needed enthusiastic uncontrollably enthusiastic warriors like the accused right there salim hamdan
1201426 the general is a war criminal and therefore the driver is too
1201427 no it didnt work that way in world war ii hitlers driver was never charged as a war criminal
1201428 what about that bayat says osama i will help you commit murder
1201429 of sept 11 2001 hamdan who is charged with conspiracy and material support of terrorism faces a maximum sentence of life in prison a two thirds vote of the jury is required to convict him the same jury would sentence him after a separate hearing
1201430 im not going to have the government close this courtroom
1201431 you know what hamdan agreed to do you know what happened how we squandered that opportunity not mr hamdan
1201432 im trying to think of all the reasons it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question
1201433 i had not had food or drink so i was thirsty and hungry and i might have been grouchy whats more they were poking needles into me all of the time
1201434 the biowatch program has been variously described by my fellow state and local laboratory directors as a parasite to the public health laboratory and squatters in valuable public health laboratory space
1201435 it has not yet developed an overarching strategic plan to guide its transition
1201436 dhs must develop a reliable means to assure the american people that major investments in this architecture will in fact make us measurably safer against catastrophic nuclear terrorism
1201437 cia needs to get out of the news as source or subject
1201438 we cannot have an approach to terrorism that only uses the hated words renditions and detentions and interrogations and that has an on off switch every other november
1201439 there is a sense that he may no longer be with us
1201440 if the reports are true it would be a significant victory
1201441 my promise to you is that i have done and i will continue to do what i can to ensure that politics is kept out of decisions about cases and out of decisions about career hiring at the department of justice
1201442 i find this conduct unacceptable and truly hope the promises you made are being kept
1201443 for many of us on this committee who care very deeply about the integrity of the department of justice it is highly inadequate to have this only look going forward approach that i detect it is very important i think that we also be prepared to look backwards find out exactly what went wrong and clean it up
1201444 can we expect in the last six months of this administration that you will step away from some of the things of the past and make a clear break
1201445 the destruction of these carbon banks and the wildlife the rare flora and water catchments has got to stop
1201446 it is three times worse for climate change previous assessments estimated and in tall eucalypt forests like those of victorias central highlands or tasmanias styx weld and florentine valleys it is 10 times worse
1201447 that is more than the whole of the transport sector
1201448 the logging industry is not only making a killing on the stock exchange for an unnecessary destruction of our forests but theyre going to make tackling climate change more expensive for every household in australia
1201449 hes the climate change prime minister but he is making this mammoth error on the altar of the big end of town and its got to stop
1201450 its in the reports you can read about it in the media reports
1201451 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1201452 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer
1201453 this news today im sure will overcome that problem virtually entirely
1201454 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
1201455 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
1201456 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
1201457 at least i know ive got a job for the next three years
1201458 i signed a couple of weeks ago luckily because my last two games havent been that great
1201459 i got in at the right time and held the club to ransom and everything so it was good
1201460 at the moment simmo skipper adam simpson we cant shake him at the moment hes 32 and hes still going
1201461 his experience and character and leadership ability that hes shown at the footy club during his time here hed be the next candidate in front of anyone else
1201462 your first years of footy you can come in and fly under the radar a bit maybe get a couple of kicks and those middle stages are when youre probably still a bit immature
1201463 i probably didnt realise that until the last couple of years that playing footy consistently every week is really hard
1201464 now i think ive got a firm grip on things and i understand whats involved each week
1201465 i think theres a lot of paranoia within the afl because of the gold coast side because everyones running around and locking away their players on long term deals
1201466 hey everyone so its been kinda a slow week in seether land
1201467 i think the most exciting thing for me was when shaun and troy decided to have a shaving party late one night i awoke to shaun morgan having a crazy porn stash looking like ron jeremy and troy mclawhorn completely clean shaven he looked like he was about 12 otherwise the tour has been cool weve played to some really crazy festival crowds and thats always fun were also looking forward to having red back out with us its their first show today also a belated congratulations to john shope at sinister choppers for winning the chopper challenge with the seether bike i want one
1201468 weve just about finished writing our new album now there will always be loose threads that need taking care of
1201469 two intensive weeks of demos after a few months of initial writing playing and recording weve got a lot of songs now which is what we intended im too much like an ostrich with my head in the sand so i dont know what kind of music it is in all honesty they were intended to be high calibre pop songs thats all i know
1201470 near strategic defeat of al qaeda in iraq near strategic defeat for al qaeda in saudi arabia significant setbacks for al qaeda globally and here im going to use the word ideologically as a lot of the islamic world pushes back on their form of islam
1201471 one of the lessons we can draw from the past two years is that al qaeda is its own worst enemy
1201472 where they have succeeded initially they very quickly discredit themselves
1201473 obituary has been written far too often in the past few years for anyone to declare victory
1201474 i agree that there has been progress but were indisputably up against a very resilient and implacable enemy
1201475 the ability to kill and capture key members of al qaeda continues and keeps them off balance even in their best safe haven along the afghanistan pakistan border
1201476 rather than relying on paper based procedures this system will leverage 21st century electronic means to obtain basic information about who is traveling to the u s without a visa
1201477 transatlantic cooperation between the intelligence services is the only way forward not the massive collection of data in general
1201478 the first time we encounter visa waiver travelers is when they arrive in the united states and that creates a very small window of opportunity to check them out
1201479 is a very good program and we are working to get it expanded across other parts of the border
1201480 operation streamline in its current form already strains the capabilities of the law enforcement system past the breaking point
1201481 its going after desperate people who are crossing the border in search of a better way of life instead of going after employers who are hiring people who have no right to work in this country
1201482 the oakeshott independent team recognises we will be outspent by other campaigns by at least 20 to one and we recognise the seat of lyne has been a national party owned seat since it was first formed
1201483 however we believe in our community we have a proven track record of 12 years in state parliament of delivering for our community and we are excited and enthusiastic about the opportunity that is before us
1201484 this investment by tiger airways of more than 105 million in aircraft assets in adelaide means more jobs in south australia with tiger airways recruiting pilots cabin crew and support staff to be based locally in adelaide
1201485 this will give interstate visitors more affordable opportunities to travel to south australia for their holidays injecting valuable tourism us dollars into the local economy
1201486 they have never attempted to set forth any basis for mr barres detention
1201487 this will give him an opportunity to go into court and be heard
1201488 department attorneys have had two meetings with chief judge lamberth and opposing counsel to discuss these issues informally
1201489 we made a commitment to the court not to comment on these issues in the media while we try to work out a suitable arrangement for moving forward
1201490 we want to make sure that it doesnt come to that
1201491 pakistani preference remains to not have outside forces action on the pakistan side of the border
1201492 there will be no agreement similar to agreements of the past
1201493 no safe haven or safe passage for any group that wants to plan attacks against any friend of pakistan
1201494 there will be people other than those who belong to hard core groups that would be willing to agree to these conditions and those are the reconcilable people that we would like on board
1201495 there are people from the tribal areas from the mehsud tribe for example that would be willing to subscribe to these conditions in return for the benefits
1201496 we intend to overcome any misgivings that have undermined intelligence sharing in the past
1201497 i am pressing the system very hard to see if we can generate any additional trainers
1201498 our country has been extremely slow i thought it was possible it might never happen
1201499 the sum of the parts of the carbon markets today may not deliver the deep cuts in emissions that are required
1201500 many domestic emissions trading schemes have self protection features that mean they are not as open or international as the architects of kyoto had in mind or as many experts in the field would recommend
1201501 i have been looking to be a martyr from long time i will god willing have this by you i understand very well
1201502 i tried for 9 11 to get a visa and i could not if this martyrdom happens today i welcome it god is great god is great god is great
1201503 its vital that our intelligence community has the ability to learn who the terrorists are talking to what theyre saying and what they are planning
1201504 given the legitimate threats we face providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program
1201505 does not understand the nature of the enemy as we face it
1201506 barack obama appears to believe that terrorists should be treated like criminals a belief that underscores his fundamental lack of judgment regarding our national security
1201507 lets think about this these are the same guys who helped engineer the distraction of the war in iraq at a time when we could have pinned down the people who actually committed 9 11
1201508 what theyre trying to do is what theyve done every election cycle which is to use terrorism as a club to make the american people afraid
1201509 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
1201510 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
1201511 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1201512 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
1201513 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1201514 suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1201515 if you like having your ears raped by sound then youll love her music
1201516 i like the elephants very much these are asian elephants actually
1201517 the reason i like the elephants is because of their size and they have massive power they cant jump though because they have no knees
1201518 we would like to acquire at least one more elephant to help increase the size of the herd
1201519 well have the two stalls a large service area for the staff to walk around these stalls
1201520 thatll keep the elephants back so that a child cant reach through the bars and an elephant reach over the fence and come in contact we dont want that to happen
1201521 i would like to see an african elephant if they could bring one in
1201522 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1201523 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1201524 at the root of the past decades unprecedented surge in world economic activity
1201525 the past decade has seen mounting global forces quietly displacing government control of economic affairs
1201526 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1201527 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1201528 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1201529 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1201530 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1201531 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1201532 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1201533 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
1201534 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1201535 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1201536 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent
1201537 provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1201538 its all part of the united states plan of deterrence and making people suffer as much as they can
1201539 its a terrible thing the united states is doing to these people
1201540 once they go into the detention program they dont have any more contact with the border patrol
1201541 so were doing what the government should be doing returning property to its owner even if its just a symbolic gesture
1201542 were really happy this is the first property weve retrieved from the border patrol
1201543 its a problem for us to find out where their stuff is they could be sent to detention in texas or california and we dont know where theyll be walked across
1201544 it seems like were working with the border patrol pretty well right now they seem willing to help us
1201545 you ask how many migrants have had their belongings seized and the answer is all of them
1201546 i believe this is part of the deterrence program which makes the experience in el norte as painful as possible and i mean painful
1201547 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
1201548 senator obama doesnt appear to have the ability to hold the traditional democratic coalition together as well as mrs clinton might
1201549 ill vote for whoever can bring the price of gas down
1201550 one thing i keep seeing is a lack of wherewithal to tackle the tough issues like health care illegal immigration
1201551 its sort of like overhauling the tax code if there was an easy way to tackle it without conflict they would have done it already at some point it takes some backbone to get it done get some backbone and decide what you stand for

1201555 she had been out on an incident scene for about an hour and half two hours literally overheated due to dehydration
1201556 after this incident ive reinforced that and told every one of them to put more water in their car and make sure theyre carrying water
1201557 if they need to get in the car to cool off even at a major incident scene if there are two officers take turns cooling off
1201558 its just like insulation in your house its going to hold the heat in so when the officers starts heating inside the vest vests can get up to 115 degrees easily
1201559 it saves our lives its our best friend when were out on the streets
1201560 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
1201561 obamas narrative is being altered enhanced and manipulated to whitewash troubling facts
1201562 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
1201563 the south valley is a huge part of the larger albuquerque community
1201564 and its wonderful to know that the new superintendent is really looking at the issues here in education
1201565 a library a new computer lab a new administrative building and then well also have new classrooms
1201566 for the longest time we had nobody coming to the south valley to see the issues that were dealing with and our issues are different than some of the issues in the heights
1201567 it feels like they want to get to know us more and the work were doing
1201568 they egged my truck too since ive been over here also they paint balled my house and they have broken windows out of cars just riding down the street
1201569 most of the graffiti you find in any city especially cities like little rock is called tagger graffiti
1201570 its not gang graffiti but it means something to the person who put it on there
1201571 its criminal mischief and depending on the dollar amount to take that off and repair whatever damage they caused it could even be a felony
1201572 we can probably find out who put that graffiti on there and when we find that out you could be facing charges not only criminal but civil
1201573 theyre going to bring their father and mother shame and also shame others that know them
1201574 the american taxpayers are paying for too many things that the iraqis ought to pay for out of their surplus
1201575 they export 2 million barrels of oil a day that oil brings in about 120 a barrel it is unconscionable it is inexcusable it makes no common sense for a country that has that kind of wealth and that kind of surplus in our banks and their banks to be sending us the tab
1201576 this is the first significant bipartisan change in our policy toward iraq
1201577 pretty much out of the business of very large reconstruction projects in iraq
1201578 espionage is a real and serious threat to our national security
1201579 a pretty low level espionage case the amount of money involved was only 50 000
1201580 the scenarios we discuss today are so hard for us to contemplate and so emotionally traumatic that it is tempting to push them aside
1201581 however now is the time to have this difficult conversation to ask the tough questions then to get answers
1201582 i definitely conclude the threat is greater and is increasing every year with the march of technology
1201583 with proper communication people can flee from the plume area
1201584 weve never looked at how all the unique things this government wages against others could be used to inform our defensive posture
1201585 we really need to move from the reality that the advantage is always with the attacker to how we can have our offense better inform our defense to shrink that gap
1201586 this an important and perhaps one of the most important national security and economic security issues facing us today
1201587 we want a broader information flow to the private sector of the threats were seeing so that they can increase their security posture as well
1201588 this is the oldest conflict in security because if we give away our best exploits we lose the ability to use them offensively
1201589 thats a conflict the guys at nsa deal with every day when you find good ones how long do you wait before you tell the vendors and people defending our own networks
1201590 we lost a key exploit for a critical hard target so there was a gain and there was a loss
1201591 many of us agree that were going to have to accept a lot more intelligence losses in order to increase the defensive posture of the nation
1201592 to my mind one of the key tests of whether this program will be successful or not is how much information falls on the classified side of the line and how much falls on the unclassified side
1201593 the more information that gets classified the less likely the initiative will succeed
1201594 what youre seeing here is the acknowledgment by the administration that dhs had its chance flubbed it and now weve got to get serious
1201595 this wasnt a question of what places a terrorist wants
1201596 the targetability is not an issue here its the vulnerability if they were targeted
1201597 if we dont have us visit air exit by this time next year it will only be because the airline industry killed it
1201598 we have to decide who is going to win this fight is it going to be the airline industry or is it going to be the people who believe we should know who leaves the country by air
1201599 we cant afford anything in the billions to support a program that should be a government program
1201600 we intend to press them on these issues we cannot accept the nature of what is going on
1201601 the constitution is what makes this country unique in the world and its presumption of fundamental rights for all people at the end of the day makes us the beacon of light for the rest of the world i am not willing to have it eroded
1201602 the department of homeland securitys denial and delay is leading to death and disability
1201603 there is a feeling that the general public and even some health professionals do not understand type one diabetes and this can have a terribly negative impact on people with the disease
1201604 it is clear that the nsl authority is too overbroad and operates unchecked
1201605 we must give our law enforcement the tools they need to protect us but any such powers must be consistent with the rule of law
1201606 its not trusting the goodwill or the angelic disposition of the government to preserve our rights we ought to learn from our experience since 9 11 and restore checks and balances congress cant just rely on the fbi to fix the problem
1201607 i said let me go i want to go to sleep if it takes saying im a member of
1201608 the use of drugs as a form of restraint of prisoners is both unlawful and unethical
1201609 these allegations demand a full inquiry by congress and the department of justice
1201610 would have to be considered an experimental use of medicine
1201611 what training or exercises are underway to test our new roles and responsibilities if an event were to occur
1201612 i worry less about that as a trigger than i am concerned about the fact that terrorists might presume we would be distracted that people who are in the job might be looking at what they are going to do next and that there wont be new people coming in
1201613 appeared to be an attempt to conceal her actions from the public disclosure
1201614 because it was felt he was not using good judgment in the costume he chose to wear
1201615 communicated with ice employees days before the incident was reported in the media or before there was a congressional inquiry and to suggest there was some sort of a cover up is completely without merit
1201616 we will review chairman thompsons recommendations but note that the report is fundamentally flawed and highly partisan
1201617 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1201618 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1201619 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1201620 one thing i would say about it is this we have the opportunity with the carbon pollution reduction scheme as proposed by the government to get on the path to reducing emissions
1201621 a regime that has repeatedly demonstrated that its word is indistinguishable from a lie
1201622 the negotiations proceeded in a sincere and constructive manner and progress was made there
1201623 we looked at the possibility of talking to the syrians on the diplomatic track
1201624 using this to say you need to comply with your international obligations stop aiding foreign fighters going into iraq stop disrupting the situation in lebanon stop supporting hamas stop repressing your own people and stop this nuclear activity and telling them we would look at military options but we wanted to take the diplomatic track first but all of our political discussions became moot when israel acted
1201625 if you give the iaea information in a timely manner as soon as you have it and the verification body can credibly go in there and investigate on the ground then you may someday know the truth the way this was done we have only their word and photographs
1201626 this administration has a proven record of falsifying and fabricating stories about wmds they have done this before they have done this yesterday and they will continue to do this in the future
1201627 we believe that its a pretty safe bet with the threat environment we face today that vice president cheney will be afforded secret service protection upon his departure
1201628 we have an enemy who has sworn to destroy this country and they have sworn to kill both the president and the vice president so why in the world would we not protect him its common sense the government and this country owe the president and vice president they owe them that safety
1201629 over the last 40 years the departing vice president has been afforded protection by our agency
1201630 we have provided protection going into july of that year that they have departed for 180 days
1201631 we worked very hard over the past years to find areas where we can work together and find ways to be agreeable when we disagree and i think weve done a pretty good job of it
1201632 in which russia and the united states and europe will participate as equal partners
1201633 this is not about language this is not about diplomatic phrasing or wording
1201634 this is about the substance of the issue id like to be very clear on this our fundamental attitude to the american plans have not changed however certain progress is obvious our concerns have been heard by the united states
1201635 you can cynically say its kicking the can down the road
1201636 i happen to believe it is a significant breakthrough simply because ive been very much involved with this issue and know how far its come
1201637 we got an agreement it was the only agreement we sought and the only agreement we could get
1201638 would we like to get it done on our watch sure
1201639 is it critical that we get it done on our watch i would say no
1201640 you can write down i was impressed and looking forward to working with him
1201641 basically he was the one heading up efforts to launch attacks against the west
1201642 a serious blow to al qaeda in terms of his key role and participation and plotting attacks against the west it will disrupt those efforts at the very least
1201643 for instance whereas the periods grubbiness and what elizabeth david called its
1201644 to gladden any puritans heart a shortage of money and of choice was positively beneficial
1201645 most of the people we spoke to had little conception of the us or our lifestyles and these obviously were people who had exposure to tourists
1201646 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1201647 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1201648 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1201649 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1201650 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1201651 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1201652 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1201653 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1201654 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
1201655 good player fan favorite wont ever leave the team hes on unless hes booted

1201659 the fz50 sensor is better per unit of area than dslr sensors because it has a higher pixel density which is just a fact that some people seem to have problems dealing with
1201660 were trying to solve a crisis of confidence would this do it
1201661 ill let you know if i need anything else abigail
1201662 it had stood there for hundreds of years and he thought it would always stand there he felt safe in the oak trees presence it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten it was his greatest symbol of strength one night lightning struck the oak tree eddie saw it next morning it lay broken in half and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a black tunnel the trunk was only an empty shell its heart had rotted away long ago there was nothing inside just a thin gray dust that was being dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind the living power had gone and the shape it left had not been able to stand without it
1201663 first the fed had an opportunity to hike at the end of june and took a pass while not widely expected at the time capital markets were relatively tranquil pre gse meltdown and the equity market could have absorbed a tightening without cratering but conditions have deteriorated since then with the gse backstopped before they could fail and stocks having a heck of a time putting in the bounce in a proverbial bear market
1201664 but for the fed to hike one has to believe that inflation can thrive in a world of not just weak growth but in a protracted global recession
1201665 now the bear market is rolling on to energy commodity and tech stocks
1201666 the size of our second quarter loss reflects the depth and breadth of the collapse of the housing and mortgage markets the continued growth in the number of defaults and foreclosures during the quarter required a significant increase in reserves the distressed markets of california florida arizona and nevada continue to be adversely impacted by declining home prices and reserves for defaults in these states comprised approximately 68 of the increase in our reserves for the quarter
1201667 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1201668 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1201669 we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages during the night or tomorrow
1201670 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1201671 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1201672 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1201673 those who dance are considered insane by those who cant hear the music
1201674 support our army navy airforce and all those who serve to protect the usa
1201675 two things the president doesnt want are new threats or even a new attack at a time when he has two chairs empty next to him that doesnt look good
1201676 has provided him with a clear understanding of the dangers we face and the importance of ensuring that we have the necessary tools to protect america
1201677 while i am sorry to lose ken as part of my leadership team i can think of no better choice to serve as the presidents homeland security adviser
1201678 his background in electronic surveillance and human intelligence in the form of informants has translated well
1201679 he spent many years running large scale investigations and brings to the job many things that only come from being a line prosecutor
1201680 im thrilled to be on the dhs team and i am looking forward to doing my best to serve the country
1201681 was unaware that kuo was a security official of the
1201682 the nomination processes and procedures vary across the intelligence community causing inconsistencies and disproportionate responsibilities in making nominations
1201683 accurate and current identifying information is critical for identifying suspected terrorists during screening practices lowering the risk to frontline screening personnel and reducing misidentifications of innocent individuals who are not suspected terrorists
1201684 the fact that these are being used against u s citizens and being used so aggressively should call into question the claim that these powers are about terrorists and not just about collecting information on all kinds of people
1201685 theyre basically using national security letters to evade legal requirements that would be enforced if there were judicial oversight
1201686 we are committed to using them in ways that maximize their national security value while providing the highest level of privacy and protection of the civil liberties of those we are sworn to protect
1201687 was significantly higher than the number of reported violations in prior years

1201689 the only reason the government is now militarizing these criminal acts is to hide what the cia is doing in its interrogation program behind the secrecy of the military commissions which can allow the use of secret evidence as well as evidence obtained through torture
1201690 i apologize to the united states government for what i did
1201691 and im sorry for what happened to those families who lost who lost their friends and their beloved ones
1201692 and he doesnt want them to be persecuted the way he was
1201693 make or receive funds for the benefit of the palestinian islamic jihad
1201694 the al arian case constitutes one of the most disturbing abuses of the grand jury system in decades
1201695 you have a great injustice being perpetrated by the justice department theyve daisy chained three grand jury investigations to prolong his incarceration
1201696 the plea agreement is clear unambiguous and does not grant al arian immunity from future grand jury subpoena
1201697 therefore we hold that the government did not break the plea agreement by issuing a subpoena commanding al arian to testify before a grand jury
1201698 it is certainly not uncommon for the government to expect a defendant to testify in the wake of a plea agreement
1201699 in this instance the agreement is silent on the question and the court of appeals agrees with the government that this leaves the door open to subpoena his testimony
1201700 the government has called dr al arian manipulative and have made it clear that they dont trust a word he says
1201701 conducted full scale armed attacks and helped incite rebellions against husseins regime most notably during the iran iraq war operation desert storm and operation iraqi freedom
1201702 i dont want my family live in america they feel ashamed im with a terrorist group i want them to be proud for what i did for the united states marine corps
1201703 after i receive this letter its been three weeks since then my whole life turns upside down you might hear from the lawyer theyre not going to revoke your visa but how can you guarantee this im expecting they stop the process of green card tomorrow theyre going to tell you to get out
1201704 to gain admission to the united states apply for permanent residency and eventually acquire u s citizenship
1201705 in my experience i cannot think off the top of my head of a snap decision that had to be made in the middle of the night
1201706 i think that one should reduce the number of snap decisions to be made
1201707 theres a phone in the white house and its ringing somethings happening in the world your vote will decide who answers that call whether its someone who already knows the worlds leaders knows the military someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world
1201708 its a bit of a specious issue somehow implying you need better judgment in the middle of the night
1201709 a quiet evening and a night of sleep were the best preparation
1201710 refutes the notion that presidents have to be on the job in a crisis situation the moment the crisis breaks it shows that it might be good judgment involved in not waking people up presidents who desire to be up at all hours may not be wired in ways that are fully in sync with the needs of the job
1201711 to an understanding that we will all have an interest in cooperation on missile defense
1201712 missile defense forms a part of a broader response to counter this threat
1201713 but there must be agreement at least to discuss the date and terms and conditions
1201714 we must give other nations seeking membership a full and fair hearing
1201715 as we invite new members today were also clear that the progress of enlargement will continue

1201834 to see all that stuff happening there i really worry at this point i dont really want him to go to that school i know you cant run away because trouble is everywhere but to see that they have a coach and a coaching staff that is not doing what they need to do to keep this stuff from happening really worries me
1201835 i dont want my son to attend a school where theres no guidance when hes away from me i want him to have a role model to keep him in line
1201836 im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option

1201850 im one of those people i guess who if it can happen it will but you learn to deal with it and you have to be careful not to create another crisis
1201851 i learned from faculty and staff how to juggle my familys needs with my own
1201852 ive also had to mediate difficult situations at empact spc which is something i learned through the social work program my internship with the miss foundation a non profit organization created by asu assistant professor joanne cacciatore dedicated to providing support to grieving individuals and families helped me learn to deal compassionately with raw emotion such as grief while staying focused on meeting the needs of the person and the family
1201853 what i have learned is that i can do it
1201854 it may be hard but you get there eventually even with my family were not there yet but weve come a long way
1201855 even if i were in the same position now as i was 10 years ago it wouldnt be as overwhelming because i have seen the support and where it comes from and i have grown personally and i see the light there was a time i didnt know if there was a way out
1201856 but the emphasis cant be on me because it isnt fair to those you are serving

1201869 a central premise of this guidebook is that gang problems are local and solutions must be based on improving understanding of the nature of those problems and the immediate underlying conditions that give rise to them
1201870 widely regarded in the field for his research on gang activity dr decker offers sensible information for local agencies to use in developing responses to their specific gang problem
1201871 the reality is that most responses to problems such as gang crime do not succeed at least in their first design
1201872 it is therefore important to document the process of designing and implementing a response so that the responding jurisdiction and others can be more successful in the future
1201873 all four components of sara are critical the model requires careful analysis before creating interventions
1201874 the gang problem is highly dynamic its important to avoid developing a fixed image of a problem that does not change as the problem changes
1201875 growing evidence shows that sustained application of the sara model greatly improves the law enforcement response to gangs and leads to safer communities
1201876 the good news is that many police departments are improving their effectiveness at developing and implementing problem solving strategies
1201877 we are seeing more organizations using data based strategic responses to issues like gang crime rather than simply putting the same fire out over and over

1201902 because they use tools such as email lists web pages and free software to organize actions share information and coordinate at a distance anti corporate globalization networks have become models for emerging forms of directly democratic politics
1201903 these groups dont need complex hierarchical structures to spread their messages or organize actions
1201904 through the same types of technologically driven mechanisms protests are now being planned for the democratic and republican conventions so it will be interesting to see what the scope of these protests turns out to be
1201905 i had never seen anything like it thousands of protestors in the streets confronting police and tear gas
1201906 i knew immediately that i wanted to study this phenomenon
1201907 a terrific deeply informed ethnographic account of the origins and activities of the anti corporate globalization movement juris identity is as much that of an activist who happens to be doing first rate anthropology as vice versa and there is much for anthropologists to reflect on in the way this work is set up and narrated through these dual identities

1201915 when two vowels go walking the first one does the talking
1201916 last year i never used to eat right now i eat healthy and work out a lot last season i played at 205 pounds and right now im 225 so i put on about 20 pounds hopefully it will help me through the long haul this season i thought i was a little small at 205 and i worked out a little bit toward the end of the year and i felt that if i put on some weight and muscle i could maybe last a little longer and be stronger towards the end of the season so thats pretty much my goal
1201917 i think our wideouts are probably the most talented group we have on the team obviously mike jones and chris mcgaha are our proven guys who made a lot of plays for us i think kerry taylor is going to have a really good year this year he has worked hard and hes good kyle williams is another guy who has had a great summer and is going to really help us this year also our freshman gerell robinson is the guy who is the most ready to play he spent a lot of time with us in the off season and i think he will make a difference for us this year
1201918 i think it will really help us out like i said we need to have all those guys in the field like those wideouts because theyre our best group we cant have them sitting on the bench and i think if we can just get the ball in my hands and get it to those guys fast and let them make plays that will be a key in our passing game and help from people blitzing us so much
1201919 its hard to make a big play when youre going through short routes and you have to get it out im more worried about doing what is best for our team and helping the team out so if they have to get it out of my hand then that is what i am going to do
1201920 to be honest i dont really know i do know we are ranked no 16 in the coaches poll and no 2 in the pac 10 but expectations are expectations i expect to have our team win as many games as we can all the expectations will take care of themselves at the end of the year i think we just have to be worried about taking one game at a time
1201921 part of me loves it because it will be a great opportunity for us as a university and as a football team to show what we can do against some of the best teams in the country we are going to be in front of the national media which is going to get us out there even more than last year if we can do well then again its pretty rough because we have georgia cal usc and oregon all in row and two of those four are on the road so that can be a pretty difficult stretch if you dont take care of things because we could be hurting by that time of year
1201922 its unbelievable thomas is really a huge asset to our team because we can put points on the board from all over the field he really helped us out last year because we had trouble scoring sometimes so it is great having a good kicker and it is great having faith in a kicker
1201923 i think they will help hopefully well find out when we start practice tomorrow as soon as we start playing against our defense well see if it is going to help us out but i think if we can run those new things we put in effectively it will slow down some teams from really blitzing us like they did last year
1201924 i think it will be better because we have all of our facilities here technology for film our weight room and our training facilities for when guys get hurt we dont have all that stuff up there so i think it makes it a lot easier being here and its more convenient guys get more rest and sleep better without all the traveling it will at least help make guys more enthusiastic during camp when it starts to get hard and well be better because of that
1201925 i think we just know what to expect from the coaching staff we know how they are how they run practices and do everything on and off the field they also know how we are we all have a better feel for how things go and obviously its much different than from when coach koetter was here and were all adjusted to that weve adjusted to the new teams on offense and defense and i think the second year will be better than the first year
1201926 it means a lot to me actually because its rare that people start a lot of consecutive games for a couple reasons people always want somebody else and on top of that injuries can happen so im thankful and im grateful that i have had the opportunity to play a lot of games and i have been healthy to do that i also know that experience usually helps a lot throughout the course of the season especially at my position
1201927 the less you blitz the better off you are youre a little more sound across the board if our front four can get pressure and we can sit seven deep then thats going to be great for our pass defense its when teams keep six or seven in thats where we can get creative and find new ways to get pressure were going to put a couple of blitzes in were definitely going to blitz and if were having trouble getting pressure then were going to create a little more hopefully our front four especially with our ends will be able to minimize that as much as possible
1201928 spring helped quite a bit robert james did a lot of the blitzing for us last year and we need somebody to step up and fill that whole be able to get pressure and create movement in the pocket if we cant find that in the fall then were just going to have to find another way to get pressure
1201929 a couple of the young guys with oliver aaron they really have that burst that robert had they just got to be a little more consistent throughout fall camp and they will be able to help us out a lot come fall
1201930 so far over summer he is making all the times jon is fast and he should help us but he has a lot of things he needs to work on like being disciplined and taking it all in hes also still young too but he should help us a lot
1201931 usually you know before the play if youre going to be doubled team or not just by playing a shade or a 3 its tough but at times you have to make a play and youll find a way to do it hopefully i can make some this year
1201932 most of it is experience with the speed of the game when you got a 12 play drive compared to a 3 play drive its a lot different and it got me ready for my senior year i just cant wait and those long plays wont even hurt me with the experience

1201937 this is always an exciting time for everybody in college football everybody is undefeated you get a chance to talk about whats going to happen in the future its a fun time for me its as fun as there is theres nothing like college football the anticipation what tv game is on whos going to win the national championship whos going to go to the rose bowl and all those different things thats what makes it such a great sport this is a great time were excited about our football team weve got a lot of returners back in a lot of different areas and weve got a lot of areas where weve got to have people step up and where were going to be very young i dont know that its unlike any year that youre going to have youre going to have people coming back and experience and youre going to have inexperience to me its a matter of how you come together what happens during two a days what happens in the fall injuries who steps up and all those different things we had a very good summer from what i understand as far as the offseason workouts thats how it is anymore its an all around every month everyday job anymore there is no time off our guys spent a lot of time here with our strength coach and did a lot of things on their own hopefully it pays off for them
1201938 well continue to close that gap weve had good players here as ive said many times coach dirk koetter did an outstanding job recruiting here were continuing to do that were going to be very young at some positions our recruiting class that we got a year ago were going to have a lot of those guys playing particularly in the offensive line this class coming in its good on paper theyre all good on paper but well find out tomorrow exactly where theyre at we feel very good about some of those young guys we really think that they can help us this year but that remains to be seen where were at right now we wont know until we start you dont know how good you are until you start playing a lot of times it takes three or four games to even find out where youre at sometimes it takes longer than that
1201939 having an experienced quarterback is huge theres no question about it quarterback is a very key position is it the total answer obviously its not the total answer but its nice to have a guy like rudy carpenter coming back whos played as many games as hes played theres nothing like playing you can have a guy thats very talented and there are a lot of them in our league and a lot of new ones in our league that are going to be playing but theres nothing like having that experience on the football field with rudy coming back i feel very good about that aspect of it not only has he played a lot hes been very successful hes a guy were depending on hes been a real leader for us since hes been here hes been a real leader this summer for us as far as organizing the things that needed to get done were very fortunate
1201940 i certainly hope so i expect him being in our offense for a year and understanding what we want were adding some things too that will really help him in my opinion were a little different team offensively just because of our personnel than we were a year ago just the experience of the rush getting the football off on time when people are in your face getting hit in the mouth which he did a number of times all that really makes a big difference
1201941 i dont know if its an advantage or a disadvantage we made a decision a year ago that we were going to get a new facility here it has nothing to do with tontozona at all its about our indoor facility we really feel that well have one of the best indoor facilities in the country it wasnt just about that it was about being to work in there in the summer time being able to work in there in the winter being able to work in there in the heat not just during training camp but during the season when we need to that is such a plus when you look inside of it and go inside of it weve got so much room more than any of the places ive been as far as practice facilities are concerned its going to be a huge advantage for us so in saying that there was no reason for us to go up there because of weather theres an advantage to staying at home as far as facilities film work our own weight room and all those different things tontozona has been great for this program over the years and it was great for us last year it doesnt have to anything to do with wanting to go up there or not its just our new facility
1201942 no i dont believe we have i try to put those memories behind me if we have thats tough you look at our schedule we play northern arizona on aug 30 michigan appalachian state coach jerome souers has done a great job up there and theyve got a great opportunity to come down here ive been on both ends of that stanford to me is huge thats our first league game at home you can go on and on its a tough stretch theres no question about it the thing about schedules is and ive grown to live with this the last four or five months the schedule is the schedule and you go play it you play them when theyre there and just go play them
1201943 i knew theyd be on top and i knew wed play them both you knew what it was going to be like those are two great programs and we just happened to play both of them we happen to play both of them again next year so thats just how it is
1201944 weve got to establish our offensive front theres no question about that were going to be young in talking about that richard tuituu who was at right tackle for us last year will not play this year he decided not to play football so adam tello will be our starter im excited about our offensive front but it is an area thats young weve got shawn lauvao and paul fanaika coming back theyre the two experienced guys and everybody else is going to be new theyre athletic and it will be exciting to see how they come about thats a real big question so well see what happens but thats probably the biggest one weve got right now
1201945 were going to be involved in some different things as far as what were doing offensively ive been in a lot of offenses in my coaching career and spread it out before people were spreading it out so were going to do some of that get it off quick and try to give him a little bit better opportunities when youre in three and five step drops you get it off a little quicker hell get rid of it the offense will be conducive to him getting rid of it
1201946 a lot of it depends on what our depth is there will be some that will play in my mind there will probably be four or five of them but who they are im not sure we need some help in the defensive front to develop some depth so thats a possibility same thing in the secondary at corner and or safety at wide receiver gerell robinson probably has a chance to compete and play its a good class well see where theyre at but i wouldnt be surprised to see four or five of those true freshmen play
1201947 weve got a lot of starters back so were about the same as we were a year ago i think were a little bit faster weve got some young guys that will play and continue to improve our speed we will continue to improve our speed all the time thats what we believe in defensively to play fast and play very aggressive our defensive philosophy is based on guys that can run so our defense every year will continue to get faster we will continue to keep it simple like we have we really believe that if you dont have to think you play faster thats what we were able to do last year now well add some different things maybe bring a little bit more pressure because were a little bit more experienced but speed is the key on defense for us
1201948 our skill areas offensively at running back and wide receiver is a strength for us any time you have keegan herring coming back and kyle williams mike jones at receiver so we do have some skill and then you throw rudy carpenter in there thats an area that i like our experience at safety with troy nolan linebacker will all those guys that played quite a bit last year mike nixon travis goethel gerald munns so we do have some experience and i dont know that there is anybody thats got a pair of defensive ends like luis vasquez and dexter davis that we have right now weve got to find a third one but theyre pretty good
1201949 well find out its hard to say it kind of depends on how we grow as a football team our goal is going to be the same every year and thats to compete for the championship and to go to the rose bowl were young and inexperienced in a lot of areas so well see how we grow and how we develop depth and then go ahead and go from there i like our team theyve had a good summer theyll compete and play hard and then well see what happens
1201950 we know each other the players know the coaches and we know the players they know how we react to things we know how they react to things its nice being around them for a year it makes a big difference last year we werent sure what to expect and im sure they werent sure what to expect of us thats the biggest difference
1201951 adam had a good spring it was a toss up who was going to start at right tackle for us anyway adam is young but hes very athletic a very good pass protector i feel good about him weve got dennis erickson named semifinalist for 19th annual george munger coach of the year award

1201956 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1201957 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumours
1201958 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1201959 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1201960 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers
1201961 that hydrogen peroxide leads to death of some cancer cells and does not seem to kill normal cells why that is we dont know
1201962 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumours the ascorbate injections reduced tumour growth and weight by 41 to 53

1202024 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
1202025 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself

1202052 the epistle of constantine to alexander and arius tells the truth and chides them both for commencing the question alexander for broaching it arius for taking it up and although this be true that it had been better for the church it had never begun yet being begun what is to be done with it of this also in that admirable epistle we have the emperors judgment i suppose not without the advice and privity of hosius for first he calls it a certain vain piece of a question ill begun and more unadvisedly published a question which no law or ecclesiastical canon defineth a fruitless contention the product of idle brains a matter so nice so obscure so intricate that it was neither to be explicated by the clergy nor understood by the people a dispute of words a doctrine inexplicable but most dangerous when taught lest it introduce discord or blasphemy and therefore the objector was rash and the answer unadvised for it concerned not the substance of faith or the worship of god nor the chief commandment of scripture and therefore why should it be the matter of discord for though the matter be grave yet because neither necessary nor explicable the contention is trifling and toyish so that the matter being of no great importance but vain and a toy in respect of the excellent blessings of peace and charity it were good that alexander and arius should leave contending keep their opinions to themselves ask each other forgiveness and give mutual toleration

1202104 make detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the stability and security of the transport system
1202105 at this stage theres no reason to think that the beijing olympic games are any less secure than previous games and in fact they may be the most secure games weve ever seen
1202106 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1202107 to refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1202108 will only serve to increase suppression of the uighur people and exacerbate tensions between uighurs and han chinese

1202120 we are proud that alexander solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary

1202125 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1202126 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1202127 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1202128 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1202129 all those who have the idea to put additional pressure on serbia are knocking on open doors because not only has serbia shown its will and determination but it also has made concrete steps related to this co operation

1202136 the scriptural revelation takes epistemological priority over general revelation not because general revelation is obscure or because man as sinner cannot know it but because scripture as an inspired literary document republishes the content of general revelation objectively over against sinful mans reductive dilutions and misconstructions of it

1202139 this new method for estimating the number of new hiv cases provides us with an important tool for better understanding and tracking the number of people infected with hiv
1202140 our state continues to be heavily impacted by the hiv aids epidemic
1202141 through december 2006 new york reported 176 008 cumulative aids cases more than any other state approximately 80 percent of new cases are among people of color
1202142 our policy for the last two years is to offer an hiv test to everyone who is sexually active

1202148 it was the wrong timing when we applied to shoot in china with the olympics approaching
1202149 the shanghai of 1941 is an opulent city with a lot of western influences and we cant find that shanghai any more even in china

1202152 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1202153 some of cooeys claims were irrelevant his case law inapposite and his factual assertions erroneous
1202154 the court has authorized me to tell you that you will not receive any new appointments on appeal or extensions of appointments under the criminal justice act in capital cases
1202155 this reflects the courts dissatisfaction with both the quality of the appellate briefs and the oral argument in cooey v coyle and the amount of the attorney s fees which were paid to you and co counsel for mr cooeys representation
1202156 motion to appoint counsel in this death penalty case in which execution is set for july 24 2003
1202157 on motion and upon such terms as are just the court may relieve a party or a partys legal representative from a final judgment order or proceeding for the following reasons 1 mistake inadvertence surprise or excusable neglect or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment
1202158 the underlying premise of the stay of execution is that the court of appeals letters to cooeys prior appellate habeas counsel have cast a cloud over the integrity of the habeas process and that it would be unseemly for cooey to be executed while that cloud exists rule 60 b relief is reserved for those cases of injustices which in certain instances are deemed sufficiently gross and to prevent grave miscarriages of justice the court finds that the extraordinary circumstances in this case could warrant rule 60 b relief it is for the sixth circuit to make the ultimate determination as to the meaning and import of its june 10 2003 letters i have had 48 hours to grapple with this unprecedented situation ultimately i have concluded that the integrity of the federal courts would be impugned if the state of ohio executes richard cooey tomorrow
1202159 here richard cooey brutally raped and murdered two women he and his associates set up this heinous crime by standing on a bridge and dropping a concrete chunk through the windshield of a randomly selected car as it passed underneath
1202160 cooey and his associates then tortured and murdered the two victims under the guise of offering assistance a state that elects to establish a system of capital punishment presumably has in mind such defendants
1202161 reasoned and thoughtful people may debate the significance of the life of richard cooey the function of federal habeas corpus however is to ensure the integrity of a states judicial process particularly when that may culminate in a defendants execution it is our responsibility as federal judges to ensure the integrity of our own process and that is why i have stayed cooeys execution
1202162 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
1202163 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
1202164 obviously we werent consulted before she decided to do any of this
1202165 its a fruitless debate and it may conjure up more ill will toward the party we should be spending money on debating the democrats on the issues
1202166 look beyond barack obamas skin color and soaring rhetoric and see an arrogant elitist millionaire
1202167 mrs rice has some very strong views on certain issues
1202168 it showed us that before we donate to anything regardless of how it appears the party needs to ensure it takes a look at all the content
1202169 i imagine were going to be the most visited booth at the convention and theres going to be blood on the floor
1202170 im looking forward to it i tell you i am having so much fun i feel that for the first time in my life im actually making a difference in whats happening in the political arena
1202171 bill clinton says barack obama must kiss my ass for his support
1202172 we wanted to carry that out and see what we could make happen if we initiated a national organization
1202173 we would tell her you cant go around bashing the democratic party and then expect them to come to our side in droves
1202174 she would take the approach well youre not a real republican then
1202175 i spent a few thousand and garnered half a million in free coverage by my estimate
1202176 there are grounds to be concerned and i think theres enough reasons why the irs should be concerned
1202177 their name alone and what they appear to be promoting also the link to the mccain campaign on their web site all appears to be problematic you cant get more inconsistent with exempt status than that
1202178 they have been convinced wrongly the republican party is a racist party
1202179 black voters feel they have no choice because they dont want to vote for the party of the ku klux klan
1202180 hundreds of thousands of little people all around the country giving 5 or 10
1202181 if she had bought into a socialist policy of government handouts wed still be poor there
1202182 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
1202183 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
1202184 how they ever convinced almost the entire black population that they are on their side
1202185 op balls pursuit was intended to deny enemy safe haven limit enemy freedom of maneuver and interdict the flow of foreign fighters in the area
1202186 the soi and consent presence of iraqi and cf has made the area much safer allowing people to travel to the markets to sell and purchase goods
1202187 on any given day the market place is very busy with the added security the ip have stepped up patrols which make the people feel safe and the local govt reps are starting to make their way to areas once not traveled
1202188 arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1202189 we are unconvinced that the government have properly thought through this aspect of their proposed scheme
1202190 there is a risk that this will be perceived to undermine the independence of the judiciary
1202191 conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1202192 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1202193 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups
1202194 protecting those who struggle to heat their homes is an absolute priority for the government
1202195 the whole family were around everyone was shouting when we got to the area his friends had uncovered his head then we concentrated on uncovering his torso we felt the problem was the weight of sand on his body and all our efforts went into getting the sand away from his chest area
1202196 the family were shouting at him to help himself believing that he was conscious and able to help us
1202197 we informed the defence and the court this morning the next hearing has been set for september when this will be discussed
1202198 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1202199 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1202200 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1202201 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1202202 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1202203 anyone who knows me knows it is not in my make up at all no one but no one should do that to a human being
1202204 i cannot begin to understand what they might be going through i can only say that i am not the perpetrator i am not the killer i just hope they get justice
1202205 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
1202206 obama however refers to him simply as my brother and says he was the only uncontested heir after their father a kenyan died in a car crash in 1982
1202207 the protesters were hostile to the police so much so that officers had to use their personal protective equipment
1202208 compared to a decade ago there are three million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1202209 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1202210 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1202211 an opportunity has been missed to address the legal and regulatory flaws which keep two million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy
1202212 with new eu moves on agency working and working time and changes on migrant domestic worker visas these are worthwhile changes won by union campaigning that will make a real difference to many vulnerable workers whose employers are breaking employment law
1202213 it is important for retailers like us to understand the real financial pressures that are facing uk families particularly when families do not have the choice to opt out like sending their children to school
1202214 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1202215 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1202216 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1202217 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1202218 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1202219 we believe that woman is from the manchester area she gave us very very specific information which we believe is very significant for this investigation i would urge that woman to get back in touch with the police
1202220 there would appear to be a manchester connection with this certain people there at icon were from manchester these are either witnesses or those who we feel are significant to this investigation
1202221 have kids when youre young so you can be young with your kids
1202222 the children themselves fare very badly from influenza but they are also the source of infection for many adults
1202223 there is an urgent need for the jcvi to review their decision
1202224 no one was hurt but they will be coming back as soon as flights can be arranged
1202225 we told the boys we would support them if they wanted to stay or if they wanted to come back and they said they wanted to come back
1202226 its very rare for this sort of thing to happen im told but all precautions had been taken and everyone including the boys had received appropriate training which they put into practice as soon as it happened
1202227 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
1202228 and was inspired to write an article and revisit the topic of how voice over demos
1202229 nos and if they had read my profile they would understand we have nothing in common

1202264 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
1202265 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence

1202288 a reality check on real home cooking sloooow food on my most recent trip upcountry we were working with women in a pretty remote area to help them organize basket making in which burundian women excel problems in basket making and sales include inputs and market access problems also found in food production in the colline hill where we were working an extended family was preparing for a wedding ceremony and of course food preparation was central everything except the tomato paste salt and palm oil is grown harvested processed cooked by the family rice dryland which had been harvested and dried in the sun was being de hulled by being pounded by two girls in large wooden pestle mortars theres no near by rice processing available it will then be sifted and the chaff saved for feeding to livestock manioc had been soaked dried in the sun pounded into flour which was being made into thick pate to eat with the sauces and meat manioc leaves were being chopped and then pounded in a mortar to make sombe to which garden eggs indigenous eggplants and wild amaranthus and onions and red peppers would be added making a tasty vegetable a family goat had been slaughtered meat was being chopped into chunks for making into a thick stew laced with onions tomatoes from the homestead and wild greens innards all were being prepared for use of one kind or another and the hide was being scraped by some boys to be stretched and dried for sale in the local market the feet and lower legs would be used by very poor to make meat broth plantains were being peeled and then fried in palm oil and then salted plantain peels go to the goats banana juice had been made from sweet bananas and we were offered cups to sip on while we talked about baskets banana peels go to the goats sorghum beer had alread been made by women in the family from their own sorghum of course and was read for serving back to baskets all grasses are locally collected and only the coloring is purchased but market access is lacking same with crops and livestock market access both for goods and services milling etc are just too far away for people who must carry everything on their heads the closest rural market being about a 2 hour walk one way and the head woman in the family is crippled and so must rely on other family members for crop and meal preparation but being crippled shes become an excellent basket weaver by way of gaining income for the family oh and water for the homestead is about an hour round trip bucolic notions of returning to simpler times ask these folks they would love to have their food preparation even minimally improved

1202316 we do object to the doh order directing the county to conduct a physical and staff assessment of these subsidiary companies that belong to molokai properties and make preparations to take over operations if the company walks away
1202317 it is puzzling that the doh would treat the county as the violator in this case molokai ranch is clearly the violator
1202318 we would have liked to have partnered with the state in holding molokai ranch accountable and protecting the rights of the consumer in fact the county itself is a consumer

1202333 these infrequent storms we get might green up the grass but they dont put enough water into the ground to keep the river flowing like it normally does

1202335 we have never implemented mandatory restrictions and i have been here 15 years

1202371 we asked them to let us off the label there was no official parting of the ways we just said were leaving and there was no response so we were out of there
1202372 we have a lot more independence now were a band thats in their mid 20s we write good songs and the albums going to be very successful radio stations that supported us through the first two albums are playing our new single so were going to have the last laugh

1202398 the weekend was good we got the numbers we had expected
1202399 its raining sunday night but we had dry nights on thursday friday and saturday and the operation of the event seems to get smoother and smoother every year
1202400 were very happy with the lineup we had and the country night is very popular because there are a lot of country music fans in pictou county thursday night is a great trial run from an operational point of view and still provides great music we can make sure everything is up to speed for the rest of the weekend
1202401 we wanted to do something to help the image of the valley
1202402 people take a lot of pride in their property out here and this is a way for all of us to come together
1202403 we asked people of the east river valley the communities on both sides of the river to plant the red flowers by their mailboxes and in front of their homes to support the canadian armed forces
1202404 i came up with the idea because everybody kept showing support for the troops by wearing a red shirt on fridays or tying a yellow ribbon around a tree
1202405 its sure nice to see everyone come together like this
1202406 weve had locals that have gone off so thats a big reason for us to do this
1202407 i see a number of changes looming on our horizon and would like to be involved in some of the ground floor plans
1202408 some of the areas i see as being crucial are taking care of our resources such as water and forestry our young people are leaving in record numbers so we have to find ways to encourage them to stay or at least become educated and come back to share their knowledge or if they must leave find reasons to encourage them to come home if even for a visit which takes in our very important tourism
1202409 fuel and its increasing cost is making all of us take a second look at how we can save both our money and our environment so more work towards this goal has to be included with our council
1202410 i feel privileged and humbled to have being asked by many of my constituents to seek the ward 3 seat to represent them on council
1202411 i feel the town has progressed as a leading municipal unit in pictou county i am proud to have been part of the towns accomplishments
1202412 my sister was with me during my illness and she continues to be with me now shes an angel on my shoulder instead of a sister by my side
1202413 she never bothered anyone with her illness she refused to say goodbye
1202414 it just goes to show how many people are affected by this disease
1202415 thats why we need to have this walk so we can get more money for research there is a lot of misconception out there people think you can detect ovarian cancer through a pap test thats not true

1202427 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten
1202428 i was thinking of a wild plant with a similar name not this herb
1202429 its a bit embarrassing but there has been no reports of any casualties please do pass on my apologies
1202430 the biggest challenge is just getting people to tell us what they saw
1202431 if its my house thats burglarized and you know who did it and you wont tell do you really love me youre contributing to the violence
1202432 the reality is that its a tough problem thats been through the ages of time and so you have to keep pushing one rock at a time never giving up hope

1202436 ale byli wszyscy nadzy uwierzcie mi to by a najstraszniejsza rzecz jak widzia em w yciu
1202437 with rampant illegal logging vague logging concession boundaries and massive blocks of pristine forest destined for the chainsaw this is a laudable step towards avoiding an ecological disaster
1202438 while the certified forests will have to be maintained according to acceptable international standards there is urgent need for other timber business operations in the region to adopt responsible forest management practices in order to ensure the conservation of this unique forest ecosystem for the benefit of people in the region and the world
1202439 illegal forest exploitation and forest crimes are largely due to poor governance and insufficient law enforcement
1202440 wwf also recognizes that responsible forest management plays an important role in the economic growth of tropical countries and reducing poverty in forest communities
1202441 wwf is convinced that the adoption of responsible forestry schemes by logging companies will contribute greatly to the conservation of the congo basin forests and towards improving the national economy and also improve the livelihoods of local communities
1202442 for the success of responsible forestry in the congo basin there is a high need for government to set up enabling conditions that include enacting adequate legislation and enforcement and promoting good governance while providing support to responsible forestry initiatives
1202443 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
1202444 they rode tremendously today and i want to dedicate this victory to them

1202447 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1202448 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received
1202449 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
1202450 there are things that can be done without the necessity of reforming the constitution
1202451 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1202452 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community

1202456 its so good itll make you cheat on your beef
1202457 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets mr lewis said
1202458 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between 3 and 4 per cent
1202459 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1202460 gov huntsman stated this is a one year experiment and i think itll take at least a year to figure it out
1202461 what might seem like a pretty good idea in july and august might not seem like such a hot deal in january and february leaving before it gets light and getting home an hour after it gets dark

1202464 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
1202465 yeah if you wouldve just waited like 5 more minutes
1202466 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
1202467 hey you make think its weird but i know at least 2 people in the bloggy world who think im a big deal
1202468 oh a friend ive never met she doesnt know me either but we are like this and i cross my fingers to indicate closeness
1202469 i believe its important to contribute more than just best quality health care to my local community
1202470 it costs more than 30 000 to train a seeing eye dog and the organisation receives no government support
1202471 charities assisting people who are blind or vision impaired are particularly close to our heart
1202472 well be matching our customers donations to seeing eye dogs australia dollar for dollar
1202473 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results
1202474 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there

1202476 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband

1202483 in any case the sale of the banking business seems quite unlikely
1202484 we think that suncorps management likes to picture suncorp as a bank with insurance operations rather than an insurer with banking operations
1202485 such mentality is in our view unlikely to change under the current leadership
1202486 so whilst this is all a handy fall back position that must mitigate some of the risks evident in the economic and company specific backdrop it seems unlikely to eventuate
1202487 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1202488 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1202489 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1202490 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1202491 the mediators were fascinated by solving disputes and helping people get along designing jewelry would seem trite to them

1202502 our mapping efforts are now focused on the remaining open trails to ensure that traillink com will continue to provide the highest quality trail information for all recreational and commuting trail users

1202505 understand exactly what is cover ed and how often youll use it and what your return on your annual investment will be
1202506 it depends on the condition of your vehicle its certainly possible you have one of those roadside assistance plans for 20 years and you never use it
1202507 if you drive an older vehicle then you certainly can end up getting your moneys worth
1202508 its often a perk with the sale of a new vehicle and its often the first year or x number of miles
1202509 if youre looking at a 50 or 80 investment youre also buying peace of mind and peace of mind means a lot to people
1202510 theres two things that are happening right now guys want to get away and guys are planning a lot of bachelor parties that are away rather than doing them nearby
1202511 vegas is a great place for guys to start out and do their getaway because theres a lot to do there
1202512 but at the same time if i was going to vegas with a buddy of mine i think i might spend a day or two on the strip at most and then head out and do some hiking
1202513 having hiked the canyon i can only imagine the view you would get from the helicopter is pretty spectacular
1202514 its a glass bridge that essentially juts out over the canyon from the west rim and you can walk out over wide open space between you and the grand canyon
1202515 if you love the game of golf theres a lot of places you can go but to really get a sense of the history and the most spectacular scenery youll ever see i think scotland is the place to go
1202516 its not that rough but the landscape is really rough
1202517 theres volcanoes and glaciers and mountains and that kind of stuff its got geo thermal areas and bubbling hot springs in the middle of nowhere
1202518 especially if you go in the summer reykjavik is a city that doesnt see much darkness
1202519 its pretty much light 24 hours a day and its known as a party city because no one is ever sleeping
1202520 over us 20 a barrel drop that should have translated into a much greater drop in the price of petrol at the bowsers
1202521 i found this amusing they were saying biggest drop theyd seen in four years
1202522 it should have been more theyre patting themselves on the back but theyre still ripping motorists off
1202523 i think were going to see petrol prices continue to go down
1202524 i think well go down to the lower 100s and that should see us with petrol prices back into the 1 20 per litre
1202525 but at the moment were still a few cents over what we should be
1202526 definitely i think my speed helps me but its a team thing
1202527 the returner is only going to be as good as the guys up front and its so much fun to have the type of guys blocking here with the great athletes you have blocking for you it makes it a lot easier on the returner when theres holes open like that
1202528 of course ive had an appreciation for blocking ever since a young age
1202529 my dad always told me a skilled big man is always more valuable than a skilled little man ive been born and raised with that so i definitely have an appreciation for what those guys do its not easy especially blocking on kickoff returns thats one of the hardest plays in football
1202530 ive got to go home and put in some extra time because i have to know a little bit more than the other guys and on top of that im a rookie i dont have the same experience as some of these veterans have in the system so i definitely have to put in some extra time
1202531 we have been working him at some different spots since he has gotten here in all three phases of the game we will see how that all comes together but he is a smart guy that has a good set of skills
1202532 he was just helping me with some things as far as defensively
1202533 its great to learn from him the knowledge he has of the game the success that hes had its an honor to be in the situation where i can play for him
1202534 troy brown is in a league of his own you cant compare me to him im just a youngster trying to learn the ropes what he was able to accomplish in his career i really admire and respect him for but im not even close to being a troy brown
1202535 you cant run in there scared youre going to take some big hits probably thats just the nature of that play but youve got to run it up in there sometimes youre going to hit daylight and other times you might get your head knocked off
1202536 just take it one thing at a time and focus on one thing at a time if im studying defense today im going to put my energy into that or if its offense or special teams im just going with the flow bouncing back and forth but im having a great time
1202537 in an update to the little green men story of not life on mars nasa has twittered the buzz this weekend was due to an interesting soil chemistry finding still preliminary
1202538 obamas crime acting too presidential but its a long ways from in the words of washington post columnist
1202539 yes you need to wake up straighten up and pay attention
1202540 the officer that responded kailen fitzgerald was in his car the second officer was inside the police department with a citizen taking a report
1202541 fitzgerald was fairly close to lincoln highway and was going out so that if anyone came into town he would see
1202542 fitzgerald felt it was appropriate for him to immediately confront hayes to keep him from getting further into town and possibly into residential areas where he could cause more problems
1202543 in a perfect world there would have been two officers but as events evolve were not always able to control circumstances
1202544 they were circling the vehicle doing a little dance if you will around the police car
1202545 you know its easy to armchair quarterback these things and there are a lot of people in the community that are questioning what fitzgerald did
1202546 officer fitzgerald did the best he could with the situation
1202547 we thought it would be a great way to highlight that even students are involved in renewable energy projects
1202548 we think that our partnership with iowa state is terrific
1202549 there are few areas where iowa state is not involved
1202550 asking a judge to overturn the legislature is no small task we fully understand that
1202551 the state has not offered any thorough explanation of the rationale for the challenged classifications
1202552 in conclusion the public interest factor weighs heavily against the entry of the restraining order requested by the plaintiffs
1202553 the evidence that the plaintiffs have suffered or will suffer substantial economic harm as a result of the smoking ban is not strong
1202554 in a manner which will help create jobs grow our economy and satisfy their customers who choose to drive there
1202555 it could help bring in more fans more attention and more tv time
1202556 thats probably going to need to start happening if this ruling goes through
1202557 we have several players that really enjoy it its just personal preference because its such a different sport from the indoor game
1202558 how would we handle having an indoor and an outdoor season would they allow athletes to play both
1202559 i think we did pretty well considering what we went through before the race
1202560 you found competition and camaraderie in the same setting teams helped each other out
1202561 youre in there by yourself for up to six hours at a time
1202562 sometimes you have to sing a song to keep yourself awake
1202563 its kind of like driving a go kart really it can actually accelerate pretty quickly
1202564 we were pretty happy we felt that was about the best we could have done
1202565 to be a team that finished was a pretty big deal
1202566 the team was content but i wanted to do better
1202567 our soil is too rich as a result we get a lot of plant growth
1202568 we have to cut the vines up off the ground a foot
1202569 we look at economic impact of the wine industry on iowa
1202570 youre investing a lot of money in the capitalism of the business
1202571 wed like to see them invest 40 percent of their own money and borrow the rest
1202572 a winery is an unusual business because iowans dont drink much wine
1202573 a lot of the wineries in iowa are developing some pretty good wine
1202574 we are running samples and analysis of wine around the state
1202575 we test for different components to local wineries and grape growers to improve their product
1202576 we can enable wineries to make a more quality product and offer solutions to deal with problems
1202577 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1202578 the secs seven bowl wins last year is the most ever for any conference in ncaa history
1202579 i think that great teams in other conferences can be and will certainly contend for national spots
1202580 if you go through our schedule and if you go through those that play in this conference they will be representative of every national honor
1202581 if youre gonna win in this conference youve got to prepare well and youve got to play well each week
1202582 anybody in the conference can beat anyone at any given time
1202583 i think for sure its just the quality of overall play but i think everyone knows its the great quarterbacks there are throughout this league
1202584 its really challenging for defenses to play well and to limit them
1202585 north grand mall contacted iowa state through the trademark licensing office as an opportunity to get isu to sponsor this new service
1202586 it brings awareness about our great institution and brings attention to where iowa state merchandise is being sold
1202587 hopefully people would come grab a bite to eat and shop as well as browse the internet
1202588 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1202589 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1202590 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1202591 we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages during the night or tomorrow
1202592 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1202593 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1202594 weve been below average for the past three months so this is a little change of pace
1202595 by the middle and the end of the week we should be back to near normal or slightly below normal temperatures
1202596 this has been about the worst year ive ever seen for weather
1202597 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
1202598 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1202599 i wish everybody would be treated like we treat people
1202600 people will find a way to have a vodka tonight thats the way it works
1202601 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1202602 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1202603 were not telling anybody to leave and were not asking anybody to leave
1202604 but we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages
1202605 all in all its going to be a rough day weather wise so the best advice anybody can give is to stay inside if at all possible
1202606 were out of a lot of heat and eat items your tuna your vienna sausages and i had about five pallets of water at one point and its all gone
1202607 weve been busy for a couple days actually for this storm
1202608 i think most people are concerned their power might be out for a few days and they wouldnt be able to pump gas
1202609 re engineer the company so that wherever possible we use global systems
1202610 how do you feel when i talk to you like that

1202613 the right education including how to make informed decisions can lead to economic and environmental sustainability

1202616 if it can protect one person its all worth it
1202617 it was my favorite class because you learned about stuff that actually applies to you
1202618 it seems that children with ad hd often lack that sense of control that comes much more easily to their non ad hd peers playing casual games such as peggle and bejeweled among others is one area in their lives in which these children can experience some sense of control with the added benefit of achieving success in something

1202625 if i have decided to receive the sacrament of holy baptism what does god expect of me now
1202626 its not the purpose of our group to harbor anyone whos violated the law
1202627 i have overpaid my account for several months i have a surplus in my account
1202628 but i was your customer just a half hour ago and on my account is the house to which the service is being transferred to
1202629 what if my house was burning down would you send out a crew to cut the lines
1202630 we just felt it was important to provide some choice in our menu
1202631 were staying very true to our brand and very true to our heritage
1202632 if you buy juice for your baby check how much sugar it has in it
1202633 if you cook eggs use the white and throw away the yolk and if you cant get to a gym walk for half an hour each day
1202634 i am really trying hard i bake chicken instead of frying it now
1202635 i want to lose weight and i want my kids to be healthy
1202636 there are so many factors and some of them are hard to change
1202637 our families have a lot of stress they live in dangerous neighborhoods with no place to walk their kids get no exercise in school they come here thinking everything in america must be good for them whether it is fast food or infant formula they dont realize the damage all this is doing
1202638 its always good to have new options for treating patients but with a new drug you dont know what the side effect profile is
1202639 in ra you have a nearly 100 percent chance of being totally disabled and dying early and you have a small chance of the side effects were talking about
1202640 most businesses are started because you have a great idea and you take it out to the public to see if they like it
1202641 this is the opposite were finding out what people want and doing it
1202642 this makes it less possible to delude yourself about what people want
1202643 its the equivalent of a comment card before you open
1202644 crowdsourcing why the power of the crowd is driving the future of business
1202645 running a restaurant is hard but if you build and really care about a community that will go a long way
1202646 keep on living life as best i can and as normal as i can
1202647 its really a gift to help usher someone out of life its a moving experience and i kept trying to be mindful of the fact that this is part of life and if i could just somehow get through it and honor his memory and keep on living life as best i can and as normal as i can thats what i would do
1202648 why did this happen to me or my husband or son or father
1202649 people in this cluster tended to report losing a part of themselves searching for and finding some meaning and describing positive personal changes
1202650 they had an orientation to life a way of looking at life that said you know what bad stuff happens when it comes along well here it is
1202651 i was blown away by one comment that one of the participants made if it hadnt been the explosion it would have been a car accident or it might have been cancer it might have been something else you know his days were numbered it happened this way and get used to it
1202652 my father never complained during my mothers neurodegenerative illness he just took care of her by himself until we finally had to put her in a nursing facility she was there for about a month before she died right after that he went into planning mode asking each of the adult kids how they felt about this and that funeral arrangement if you asked him how he felt hed tell you i feel torn apart i feel relieved i miss her but unless you asked him how he felt he didnt really talk about his feelings
1202653 this is a product that we dont believe meets our high standards for the general population particularly for small children who are more sensitive
1202654 while there is little exposure today to the pesticide we dont think theres a need a reason for any exposure
1202655 this could have major ramifications around the world as there are many countries that export rice coffee and bananas to the u s
1202656 its one of the most widely used pesticides in the world
1202657 it does give us an opportunity to prove this product is safe from a dietary risk standpoint
1202658 if these exposures happen they dont meet our rigorous standards
1202659 its not a benefit risks decision its a risk based decision
1202660 this is part of our process to ensure we have the safest food supply of any country in the world
1202661 crosses socioeconomic levels race and gender and is prevalent across ages
1202662 at least one third to one fourth of women students have experienced some type of forced sexual contact
1202663 as pediatricians we ask our female patients are you dating someone has there been any violence have you been a victim of date rate or physical harm on a date but how often do we ask a guy a lot of that information just isnt sought out
1202664 how could someone who loves me do this to me
1202665 this is my partner we do this all the time
1202666 the earlier you are in the cycle of violence the longer its likely to continue
1202667 if your child doesnt know what a healthy relationship is when they go out into the world it can be detrimental to them
1202668 i believe a world in which everyone is aware of the destructiveness of tobacco and empowered to avoid it is within reach
1202669 we just have to imagine it and then demand it
1202670 we said lets design our work to be complementary to this
1202671 well the orders say the right ear but dont worry the doctor will check both ears on the morning of surgery
1202672 have him wear comfortable clothes nothing to eat or drink after midnight bring your insurance card
1202673 could you tell me what ear it says is being operated on
1202674 well it definitely says his right the word right is even highlighted
1202675 is this andrews mother sue from the surgery center called i explained to you that the doctor would look in both ears before operating
1202676 were going to put a mask on you andrew youll fall asleep and then the doctor will operate on your right ear
1202677 shes very concerned that we operate on the left ear
1202678 so were going to put the tube in his right ear
1202679 no his left ear he has only ever had problems with his left ear the hearing loss is in his left ear
1202680 we looked at near misses and compared them with events that did not get caught and went on to produce wrong site surgery the number one action that prevented the error from actually occurring was the patient or a family surrogate speaking up
1202681 family was far and away the best source of corrective information
1202682 occasionally occur in writing down the information on the medical record
1202683 never let any medical professional say something about your child that doesnt seem right to you no doctor will ever know your child as well as you do
1202684 when the kids are hungry they go to their mother not their father and when there is less food women are the first to eat less
1202685 weve got to change the mindset from treating sick people to preventing illnesses in the first place
1202686 whats been interesting is that if you make it easier for people to make better choices they actually do
1202687 what we are seeing in young adults right now could foretell a much larger number of melanoma cases in older women
1202688 one possible explanation is increases among young women of recreational sun exposure or tanning bed use
1202689 both of these things have been identified as risk factors its possible increases in these two behaviors may be responsible
1202690 the reason for the leveling off in melanoma rates among young men is not known
1202691 this may reflect reductions over time in the amount of sun exposure experienced by young men public awareness campaigns regarding sun exposure and melanoma were widely launched in the us in the 1980s however we really dont know for sure
1202692 these findings are important because they suggest that public education campaigns to educate americans about the risks of skin cancer from sun tanning do not appear to have resulted in a reduction in melanoma rates among young women
1202693 they may feel more protected and so stay in the sun for a longer time
1202694 the take home message is unprotected outdoor ultraviolet exposure is dangerous
1202695 ultraviolet radiation is a carcinogen if you bathe your skin in the ultraviolet light carcinogen long enough skin cancer is going to develop
1202696 teen girls concerns about their own weight about how they appear to others and their perceptions that their peers want them to be thin are significantly related to weight control behavior
1202697 there are actually a lot of farmers right now who are trying to do the right thing
1202698 right now we need a way to source our seafood in a way that meets our customers expectations
1202699 we dont want to be waiting on the sidelines we want to be very active in the process
1202700 theyre definitely putting out the most comprehensive aquaculture standards for a retailer
1202701 it really makes a statement to suppliers around the world that this is something that buyers want and that customers want
1202702 many of the companies that we assessed and the industry in general seem to have realized that there is a problem and to varying degrees are starting to work on it
1202703 we think that retailer is able to think long term and able to work long term in order to get a better product and thats how we want to work
1202704 the workers cant easily just go out to lunch at a nearby subway or mcdonalds
1202705 so not a lot of butter and eggs and cream
1202706 i think these data suggest that men may be much more responsive to a diet in which there are clear limits on what foods can be consumed
1202707 it suggests that because women have had more experience dieting or losing weight theyre more capable of implementing a more complicated diet
1202708 its staggering when we look at what really exists for kids at the margins during the summer
1202709 the drop off is hugely larger than it should be
1202710 we would go into alleys and hand out fliers about the program
1202711 any way we could get the information into the hands of constituents thats what we did
1202712 they were a godsend to me as a single parent
1202713 knowing we can come here and have a free meal its been a highlight of our summer
1202714 one important finding was people who were biologically older are happier than younger adults
1202715 people would expect it to be in the opposite direction you start off by saying older people have illnesses deaths of spouses they must be less happy
1202716 a lot of people think of people working in their 60s and 70s as trapped in their jobs most of the people who continue working are people who like their jobs
1202717 most older workers work because they enjoy their jobs those who did not were mostly able to retire and pursue other things in 1960 the old were the poorest segment in america and they have become less poor over the last half century
1202718 i was wondering if perhaps we could do something together heres my idea
1202719 if americans can watch this video and still support barack obama then america is beyond all hope

1202743 in the life or death world of extreme adventure sports there is one thing that athletes often keep quiet about the forbidden territory of paranormal experiences in explorers of the infinite award winning outdoors journalist and lifelong adventure sports devotee maria coffey probes the mystical and paranormal experiences of mountaineers snowboarders surfers and more she reviews cutting edge science and consults the history of philosophy and spirituality to answer the question could the state of intense aliveness that is the allure of extreme sports for so many actually be a route to a connection with the beyond
1202744 explorers of the infinite is littered with the bodies of climbers for whom the mountains became a final resting place

1202746 if you think reinhold messners yeti sightings were nutty wait till you hear the tales
1202747 why do certain athletes climbers snowboarders singlehanded sailors and other hard driving types seem to have more spiritual and supernatural epiphanies than your regular joe 10k thin air mental exhaustion and dehydration might be part of it but coffey posits a more curious theory that athletes ability to push beyond human consciousness into another realm helps them break physical boundaries and vice versa

1202794 while weve been through this flat period as a number of other developed countries have particularly those with high levels of investment in the property sector things are looking better for the latter part of this year
1202795 in a softening economy people will be very hesitant about price increases and other things so thats given us enough room to cut interest rates

1202806 mi tactica es quedarme en tu recuerdo no se como ni se con que pretexto pero quedarme en voz
1202807 mi tactica es ser franco y saber que sos franca y que no nos vendamos simulacros para que entre los dos no haya telon ni abismos

1202821 and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
1202822 examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates 2 corinthians 13 5
1202823 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
1202824 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
1202825 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded
1202826 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
1202827 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1202828 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1202829 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1202830 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1202831 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1202832 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1202833 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1202834 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1202835 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1202836 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1202837 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1202838 man the price of fuel you know wife bought a hybrid
1202839 yeah i can understand that but this is a hybrid too
1202840 why dont you just drop her in the garage and tarp her and let her sit for awhile
1202841 naw its time to part ways the wife will be happier and i can look for something a bit more economical
1202842 sure i mean youve driven her to car shows and such obviously you get something
1202843 we could do some mathematics take her for a spin hell ill fill er up and we can take her around town you know the size of the tank we can keep track of the miles math will do the rest
1202844 then maybe you can have some ammunition to tell the wife how it isnt all that bad
1202845 come on you love the car dont you i can tell hell i just stopped to see why anyone would want to sell a one of a kind rat like this one
1202846 tell ya what i need to sell her i just do you know the price you take her out for the afternoon and then you can tell me the mpg and i can tell you what ill let her go for are you interested in buying her id like it that someone i like buys her youre the first one that knew half a spit about what is going on with this car
1202847 okay you got a deal ill go pick up my girl and well spin in the heat and then ill come back with the verdict what you want as collateral
1202848 tell ya what ill just take her now and leave you my car and keys and that way you figure ill come back
1202849 when you have something like this fuel price isnt really on your mind whats it worth to be able to tool around in this knuckledragger its not a car its a lifestyle
1202850 the verdict is ill take her your price is right
1202851 who cares the car is thirsty katrina is thirsty im thirsty were gonna go to the biker bar get a drink fill er up again and hope that next weeks check can cover the fuel
1202852 camaan dont bullshit me youre all a bunch of slack jawed pussy fagots this stuff will turn you into a sexual tyrannosaurus just like me

1202872 now when jesus was in bethany at the home of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume and she poured it on his head as he reclined at the table

1202881 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1202882 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer
1202883 this news today im sure will overcome that problem virtually entirely
1202884 well i was having a quiet round of golf with my wife when at a difficult hole we both sliced our balls into a cow pasture we went to look for them while i was looking around i noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end
1202885 i walked over lifted its tail and sure enough there was a golf ball with my wifes monogram on it stuck right in the middle of the cows arse

1202898 the destruction of these carbon banks and the wildlife the rare flora and water catchments has got to stop
1202899 it is three times worse for climate change previous assessments estimated and in tall eucalypt forests like those of victorias central highlands or tasmanias styx weld and florentine valleys it is 10 times worse
1202900 that is more than the whole of the transport sector
1202901 the logging industry is not only making a killing on the stock exchange for an unnecessary destruction of our forests but theyre going to make tackling climate change more expensive for every household in australia
1202902 its in the reports you can read about it in the media reports
1202903 of course these improvements in passenger facilitation have required substantial investment and security costs continue to be well above the level which is currently recoverable under the existing airline charging agreement
1202904 whilst the second quarter performance demonstrates the resilience of the airport operating model we are cognisant of the difficulties which the current operating environment presents to our major airline customers
1202905 at least i know ive got a job for the next three years
1202906 i signed a couple of weeks ago luckily because my last two games havent been that great
1202907 i got in at the right time and held the club to ransom and everything so it was good
1202908 at the moment simmo skipper adam simpson we cant shake him at the moment hes 32 and hes still going
1202909 his experience and character and leadership ability that hes shown at the footy club during his time here hed be the next candidate in front of anyone else
1202910 your first years of footy you can come in and fly under the radar a bit maybe get a couple of kicks and those middle stages are when youre probably still a bit immature
1202911 i probably didnt realise that until the last couple of years that playing footy consistently every week is really hard
1202912 now i think ive got a firm grip on things and i understand whats involved each week
1202913 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
1202914 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1202915 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency

1202918 it gives motorists access to large car benefits at small car fuel costs
1202919 the oakeshott independent team recognises we will be outspent by other campaigns by at least 20 to one and we recognise the seat of lyne has been a national party owned seat since it was first formed
1202920 however we believe in our community we have a proven track record of 12 years in state parliament of delivering for our community and we are excited and enthusiastic about the opportunity that is before us
1202921 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1202922 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1202923 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1202924 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1202925 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1202926 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1202927 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1202928 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1202929 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1202930 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product

1202971 heres a fundamental irony at about the time that the first empirical evidence is accumulating to support the christian doctrine of dominion that god has granted to the human race a delegated but effective authority over the planet as evidenced by our impact on not just local but global environments you see christians shrinking back from the doctrine

1202990 evidential arguments purport to show that evil counts against theism in the sense that the existence of evil lowers the probability that god exists
1202991 an omniscient wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any suffering

1202993 take all the words available in the human vocabulary and read them from the dictionary and you have only a list of words but with the creativity and imagination god has given human beings let these words flow together in the right order and they give wings to the spirit every child ought to know the pleasure of words so well chosen that they awaken sensibility great emotions and understanding of truth

1202999 if the existence of x celestial teapots fsms god has not been disproven it does not follow that x exists or even that it is reasonable to believe that x exists
1203000 that belief in god i e belief that god exists is epistemically on a par with believing in a celestial teapot just as we have no reason to believe in celestial teapots irate lunar unicorns lunicorns flying spaghetti monsters and the like we have no reason to believe in god
1203001 the issue is whether a reasoned case can be made for theism and the answer is in the affirmative
1203002 belief in god and in russells teapot are therefore not on a par since there are no empirical or theoretical reasons for believing in his teapot
1203003 we have evidence that a flying spaghetti monster created the universe
1203004 how much more will they freak if scientists and philosophers tell them they are nothing more than sophisticated meat machines
1203005 when we consider whether free will is an illusion or reality we are looking into an abyss what seems to confront us is a plunge into nihilism and despair
1203006 free will does exist but its a perception not a power or a driving force people experience free will they have the sense they are free
1203007 the more you scrutinize it the more you realize you dont have it
1203008 whatever choice you make is unforced and could have been otherwise but it is not random you are responsible for any damage to your pocketbook and your arteries
1203009 a vote in favor of free will comes from some physicists who say it is a prerequisite for inventing theories and planning experiments
1203010 all the varieties of free will worth having we have
1203011 we have the power to veto our urges and then to veto our vetoes
1203012 we have the power of imagination to see and imagine futures
1203013 free will is an illusion but its a very persistent illusion it keeps coming back
1203014 even though you know its a trick you get fooled every time the feelings just dont go away
1203015 free will implies that i am capable of making my own decisions doing things contrary to my programming
1203016 however if the evidence was clear that the prints were not planeted even 20 people testifying that mr doe was at the party would be hard to swallow
1203017 however if the evidence was clear that the prints were not planeted
1203018 that unless you are contending that billions of people are unreliable then the fact remains that when an atheist says evidence he really means scientific evidence and is unconsistent as he considers courtroom testimonial evidence valid but religious testimonial evidence invalid
1203019 however if the evidence was clear that the prints were not planeted
1203020 until such time as you can prove the existence of a god of any kind and that your conception of this god is correct criticizing secularists for trying to figure out free will is ridiculous
1203021 it is hard to envision something like that outside the world of science fiction

1203049 the atomic number of zee is 30 was the passphrase before the gates would open i think it was cheesy but well i revel in weirdom at 2 in the morning
1203050 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1203051 we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it any more
1203052 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1203053 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1203054 but finally some climbers did not take their responsibility and then accidents like this happen very easy
1203055 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1203056 i went around and watched seven guys during individual drills the first 10 minutes of practice just to see how they were moving
1203057 i watched matt shaughnessy run off of the ball during our pursuit drill and he really had a great gait he had had some weight room numbers two weeks ago that were above what he was when he was injured so i think mentally he was into it
1203058 one of the surprises of the day which as coaches we had hoped for silently was the emergence of our punter
1203059 one thing i think all of our players would say if asked about the surprise of camp was that brad nortman was able to go out there and show that he definitely has a live leg and has the ability to put the ball in the right area for us to have success in the coverage game
1203060 communication wise we did a period in the middle of practice where we kind of shotgun fired two huddles at a time at our defense a little faster than normal game speed and everybody handled it pretty well
1203061 i really believe that he feels a fresh start is going to be in his best interests
1203062 wont be with us this fall or probably any time in the future
1203063 he gave up some money to walk on with our football team so i respect him for that
1203064 we really felt that we needed a couple more bodies that we felt could project to play for us this year at the defensive line
1203065 we turn to home d cor fashion pop culture and even personal blogs for inventive finds in an effort to differentiate from other wedding blogs and websites
1203066 highly personalized weddings have taken over the mass produced look of previous generations and couples consistently seek new ways to set their weddings apart
1203067 above all couples want their wedding day to be special and unique
1203068 youd think an arch conservative working in an overwhelmingly liberal town would think about restraining himself for expediencys sake if nothing else
1203069 its going to be hard henceforth not to think of voight as some kind of diseased wingnut
1203070 its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance
1203071 youve seen both the champ and table for five and its only now you have a reason to feel negatively about voight
1203072 i hope its not a shock to anyone that people tend to hire according to whims and hunches likes and dislikes alliances and contretemps admit it it feels good to stick it to people you dont like or strongly disagree with
1203073 its been said in this town many times that the right has a debt to pay for the blacklisting of lefties in the 50s and that in all fairness its probably going to take a long time to make amends the fact is that the philosophical grandfathers and great grandfathers of todays right wingers ruined the lives of many hollywood screenwriters in the 50s and so their descendants now have to suffer and make up for that
1203074 if you go in and look at the number of unregistered voters african american voters the potential is just incredible
1203075 we in south carolina are working to make our dream come true and it will happen
1203076 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1203077 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1203078 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1203079 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
1203080 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1203081 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1203082 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1203083 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1203084 my name is kristi and i went to high school with julie i recognize both of you from
1203085 people ask did he commit suicide or did he have an accident in his plane it happens off camera so its up to the viewer
1203086 i knew from the first episode and saw his friend daniel that this might be a possibility
1203087 but i tell you when we shot it one of the things rodrigo garc a a director on the show said is hes not necessarily gay
1203088 didnt fit into his mind his world what he was socialized to think so in shooting it the whole time it wasnt until the very end that we played with that possibility and that took it down a whole other path

1203091 first profit warning in the luxury sector and probably not the last
1203092 people have been expecting a slowdown in the luxury goods sector for the past year or so but the sector has proved resilient so far people are cutting back on some discretionary items but are still saving up to buy luxury goods
1203093 in general luxury goods sales are still doing well and growing in double digits however few companies have released earnings so far so we will need to wait for the end of the earnings season to get a better picture lvmh showed solid earnings growth last week this is reassuring for the whole sector
1203094 i dont think we should extrapolate from bulgaris results to the rest of the sector bulgari has been an underperformer
1203095 the world is slowing so you cannot expect the luxury goods sector to escape

1203173 children are not always escaping from the mundane but from the horrific from all kinds of strong frightening feelings they have they dont really mind a little anxiety and heart failure so long as they know it will end all right max the hero of my book discharges his anger against his mother and returns to the real world sleepy hungry and at peace with himself certainly we want to protect our children from new and painful experiences that are beyond their emotional comprehension and that intensify anxiety and to a point we can prevent premature exposure to such experiences that is obvious but what is just as obvious and what is too often overlooked is the fact that from their earliest years children live on familiar terms with disrupting emotions that fear and anxiety are an intrinsic part of their everyday lives that they continually cope with frustration as best they can and it is through fantasy that children achieve catharsis it is the best means they have for taming wild things it is my involvement with this inescapable fact of childhood the awful vulnerability of children and their struggle to make themselves king of all wild things that gives my work whatever truth and passion it may have

1203238 the weakening of al qaeda over time is obvious to us based on their ability to deliver an effective ied
1203239 yeah we might not be as effective as you know with a slayer but we get the job done
1203240 of course buffy has super fast healing and strength and all that other slayer stuff
1203241 hey im trying to make a point here no willow babble
1203242 were not getting any stronger if anything were getting weaker because we dont have any time to recover and this is against fledglings what happens if we run across an entire
1203243 what the hell do you call a bunch of vampires anyways a gang
1203244 what happens if we run across an entire murder of vampires or what if spike comes back to town or what if some big bad shows up to end the world
1203245 youre supposed to be all witty and funny not all glum and gloomy
1203246 hey im not sayin we should give up or anything but we do need a better plan
1203247 yeah but first i need to know how much money you guys have and if youd be willing to make an investment
1203248 thought about it but gunfire might get the cops drug into this and im really not in the mood for any illegal use of firearms charges though if this doesnt work then it s a solid plan b
1203249 if i tell you you have to promise me that you wont tell giles about this idea
1203250 lets just say that i dont think hell like the idea
1203251 but ive been keeping my nose clean so what ever it is youre here for i am not responsible and who is your friend i dont recognize him
1203252 that s oz and were here because we need you to cast a spell for us
1203253 if its not enough then i bet we can figure something out
1203254 oh i didnt say i wouldnt take it just that it s a bit on the low side
1203255 so what is this spell you want me to do
1203256 that is a very tall order youre asking me and while it sounds like fun
1203257 weve been doing some of our own research that might help out
1203258 very well done i must say this offers me a an extremely solid foundation to work with as it is much easier to work with what is already there than it is to come up with something new
1203259 so i take it that the young man is to be the substitute slayer
1203260 willow here is not really into the kicky punchy bit and oz is a musician
1203261 ill do it but i need three things in return
1203262 once the spell is cast i get to stick around see how my boy performs
1203263 if that is the way you feel then please do not allow the door to strike you in the arse on the way out
1203264 and lastly once this spell is developed it will require physical components
1203265 in fact i can think of three items that will be useful right now
1203266 ah yes to the point i like that in a woman and since you asked i shall explain what we need are items that have a strong connection to the previous spells and modifications to serve as foci during the casting spell first i need the plastic rifle i sold to your friend on halloween for its connection to the soldier spirit
1203267 i still have it though its in the basement so finding it will take some digging
1203268 second i will need something related to the fish man transformation a fragment of the shed skin of one of the members who completed the transformation would work though a pure sample of the metamorphic agent would be better
1203269 yeah youre not going to turn me into a fish are you
1203270 good the last component i will need is something from the hyenas who were the focus of the primal empowerment ritual
1203271 wait were going to have to get fur from the zoo hyenas
1203272 yes and it cannot be any hyena it must be one of the ones who was the focus of the original spell
1203273 that s not a problem because they havent moved any of them
1203274 now that s all over ill begin work tomorrow now if you all will excuse me its three in the morning get out of my house and dont come back until you have the spell components
1203275 that redhead youre always hangin around and her mute boyfriend are here so get out of your fuckin bed and answer the goddamn damned door you dumb shit
1203276 i though wed help you find that rifle and then talk about how were going to get the other components
1203277 yesterday was pay day they just stocked up shes not going to be sober till at least monday
1203278 seems like my mom tried to organize the basement again
1203279 occasionally when she gets really blitzed she gets the idea in her head to clean up the basement she usually comes down rearranges all the boxes and passes out on the sofa the rifle could be anywhere
1203280 yeah jesse gave it to me for my sixth birthday
1203281 la configeration de lamentation this is strange its awfully complex looks like the instructions for a puzzle box or a spell maybe both
1203282 put it to the side well show them to g man once were done here
1203283 oh i didnt know that your grandfather fought in the war
1203284 two purple hearts two bronze stars silver star good conduct medal asiatic pacific campaign medal world war ii victory medal
1203285 you know you cant kill vampires with a gun right
1203286 standard army officers fixtures not sure if the blade is a traditional katana or mass produced though soldier guy is good with guns not so hot with swords i guess ill show it to g man maybe he be able to figure it out
1203287 sure i was going to ask you if you knew if it s a real katana or just some mass production piece of junk
1203288 honestly xander i am not sure i must admit that my knowledge of oriental arms tend to be somewhat lacking though i could send the weapon to my friend duncan he is an expert in these matters and would be able to properly identify it if youd like
1203289 no id say it was actually quite a bit worse
1203290 if any of you wish to know more i implore you to either ask later or look up the lament configuration or lemarchands boxes in my copy of bolingers encyclopedia of the occult now if you excuse me i am going to have another drink and lie down
1203291 well we need to figure out how to get the other two spell components
1203292 its just that im not sure how to do it
1203293 well i know that buffy and giles got rid of all the fish transformation stuff so were going to have to get some skin samples good thing that camerons parents buried him
1203294 or at least the parts that didnt go all fishy
1203295 yeah i was part of the swim team so i got invited to the funeral with everyone else his mom spent half the time crying that they had so little left to bury
1203296 only is sunnydale is grave robbing one of those things that goes without saying
1203297 those plans were for a really nasty evil puzzle box made by an evil french toymaker during the 18th century from murdered peoples bones and stuff that opens a gateway to another reality so nasty cenobite demons can come and drag your soul to a hell dimension where youll suffer constant sadomasochistic tortures and pleasures for the rest of eternity unless youre turned into one of them first
1203298 yeah stupid question so what do we do about the hyenas
1203299 we need to work out the details but it s a plan
1203300 around here people usually spend their time trying to get out of graves and not into them
1203301 just hey willow could you hand me a water bottle
1203302 you know its mighty convenient for you kids to dig your own grave ill be saving the girl for desert so which of you boys would like to be the appetizer and which would like to be the main course
1203303 what kid you think youre some kind of holy man
1203304 yeah id like to know that too oz since when have you been a priest
1203305 replied to the universal life church add in rolling stone magazine got ordained
1203306 now could you help me get out of here please
1203307 well this means that tomorrow its time to begin mass production time to seriously stock up on holy water
1203308 ill load up the van we can meet at school
1203309 youre not the only one who thinks were in over our heads
1203310 we got jumped by a vamp he blessed my water bottle and it worked like a charm
1203311 unless that crazy guy working at the quick stop is actually a priest and blesses all the bottled water id have to say it was normal
1203312 do you have any more water you need to bring in
1203313 then you may use one of the book carts to help expedite the process
1203314 when you are finished i want you to accompany me to the basement i would like you to bless the water tank for the schools sprinkler system
1203315 if you need me ill be in my office i feel the need to lie down
1203316 not sure yet first thing we need to do is get a map but i havent gotten the chance to pick one up yet
1203317 are you serious hes a werewolf id think that would kind of make him ineligible or something
1203318 his holy water seemed to work well enough last night
1203319 oh cool so we have ourselves a holy water factory then
1203320 so why are you here you usually have other places to hang out besides the school library
1203321 why have you guys been cutting me out of patrols its not like i dont mind the extra sleep but i want to know what going on
1203322 well as soon as willow gets back from the computer lab were going to start planning a break in at the zoo want to know the details
1203323 right you have fun im going to get a mocha
1203324 the hyena section is open from 8am to 6pm feeding times are at 7 30 am and 6 30 pm the only personnel there after 10pm are the security guards and some vets
1203325 then by say one or two in the morning theyd be pretty hungry
1203326 we go over sticking to the hedges lining the paths
1203327 two problems dont they have razor wire over the walls and how do we open the doors
1203328 we can throw a heavy blanket over the wire as for the locks they use padlocks right
1203329 once were in we lure them close to the bars with some meat and use the tranq gun on them
1203330 we have to think up the stuff well need your tranq gun some rope a heavy blanket scissors a bag and lock picks
1203331 and dark clothes just in case one of the guards is actually crazy enough to patrol the grounds
1203332 im sorry i didnt mean to trip i mean i could have broken you necks or my neck or
1203333 now will you guys please get off me youre heavy and i think one of ozs stakes is poking me in the side
1203334 youre kidding me right are you sure youre okay did you hit your head
1203335 if there is one lesson i learned from soldier guy it s the value of a cardboard box wills im not exaggerating when i say that how you use a cardboard box can mean the difference between success and failure between life and death treat your box well and it will treat you well
1203336 do either of you know how to pick a lock
1203337 enter we unannounced and unwanted quick and sure our prize hermes we beseech thee let the lock be unblocked with a simple knock
1203338 we want a sample for every one of them having a sample form the hyena that actually possessed xander might help the spell
1203339 oz im going to throw this in when they go for it shoot one of them
1203340 i dont think theyre going to fall for it this time
1203341 i just hope i dont have to throw this one back
1203342 i saw a big wire coat hook that might work in the closet but wed need to attach it to a pole
1203343 it doesnt look like its meant to attach to one
1203344 now lets do this and get the hell out of here
1203345 you told us to come back when we had the spell components
1203346 when i told you to bring them back i did not mean at
1203347 no fine youre here and you are paying me for this
1203348 you just invited us into youre house in the middle of the night
1203349 the rifle is the only toy plastic rifle i had
1203350 its fur from every member of the pack i thought if some fur form the original hyena was there it might work better
1203351 are you sure that this is it from the correct hyenas
1203352 theyre the same hyenas that were there a last time we were to the zoo i made sure
1203353 i doubt theyd react well to you just asking to shave their animals
1203354 very well done you have done a superb job of swiftly delivering exactly what i need now i warn you this spell will take some time to create but i give you my word as a professional that it will be what you wanted
1203355 i would like you to come by some time in the next few days so we can begin researching the spell is that acceptable
1203356 now id like to ask all of you to please leave and in the future dont stop by in the middle of the bloody night
1203357 that s why happens when you only get three hours sleep in two days
1203358 we just didnt get much sleep last night patrolling and all that
1203359 then i will be brief there have been two odd events in the last couple days that seem to require some level of investigation
1203360 it seems that last night someone broke into the sunnydale zoo the hyena exhibit to be precise and the night before that the grave of one of your classmates one of the swim team if i recall was uncovered
1203361 i want all of you to keep an eye out for any details we do not know why this was done but there must be some ulterior motive
1203362 if we find anything youll be the first to know
1203363 were leading in terms of hours played a recent study showed that 18 26 year olds are roughly spending 75 hours a week with our box which is pretty amazing that audience tends to be the leader it tends to influence younger siblings in a household in terms of whats cool and whats hot in the consumer electronics space
1203364 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
1203365 we arent against mormonism but romney is not a thoroughgoing evangelical and his flip flopping on issues is understandable in a liberal state like massachusetts but our people wont understand that
1203366 i will vote for mccain unless he does one thing you know what that is if he puts romney on the ticket as veep
1203367 it will alienate the entire evangelical community 62 million self professing evangelicals in this country half of them registered to vote are going to be deeply saddened
1203368 the republican party should be the sams club party and not the country club party
1203369 if he is unwilling or unable to execute our preferred game plan we are going to take our ball and go home
1203370 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
1203371 there is no threat from al qaeda there is no threat from the extremist militia and the outlaw militias
1203372 the organization related to al qaeda is severely disrupted as described by general abdul amir and as well the militia are as well in babil province
1203373 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
1203374 what a waste of time were in a war against radical islam and hes investigating fascism that cant be relevant to anything
1203375 the abolition of the senate and the creation of a national technical council on intellectual and manual labor industry commerce and labor
1203376 a foreign policy aimed at expanding italys will and power in opposition to all foreign imperialism
1203377 a large progressive tax on capital that would amount to a one time
1203378 the seizure of all goods belonging to religious congregations and the abolition of all episcopal revinues
1203379 uttering printing writing or publishing any disloyal profane scurrilous or abusive language about the united states government or the military
1203380 beef up the physical and moral fiber of an embryonic new army
1203381 this is war lethal and more menacing than any other crisis in our history
1203382 fdr used the post office to punish his enemies and lied repeatedly to maneuver the united states into war and undermined congresss war making powers at several turns
1203383 the kennedy presidency represented the final evolution of progressivism into a full blown religion and national cult of the state
1203384 great man in the mold of wilson and the roosevelts
1203385 more children from the fit less from the unfit that is the chief issue of birth control we want fewer and better children and we cannot make the social life and the world peace we are determined to make with the ill bred ill trained swarms of inferior citizens that you inflict on us
1203386 in the lefts eternal vigilance to fend off fascism they have in fact created it albeit with a friendly face
1203387 you may stay in business and own your factories in the spirit of cooperation and unity we will even guarantee you profits and a lack of serious competition in exchange we expect you to agree with and help implement our political agenda
1203388 fascism is the cult of unity within all spheres and between all spheres
1203389 everything in the state nothing outside the the state then the implicit motto of
1203390 independent associations of citizens who pursue their own interests and ambitions free from state interference or coercion
1203391 the way various groups individuals and families work for their own purposes the result of which is to make the society healthily democratic
1203392 term social scientists use to describe the way we work together for common purposes
1203393 as adults we have to start thinking and believing that there isnt really any such thing as someone elses child for that reason we cannot permit discussions of children and families to be subverted by political or ideological debate
1203394 the danger is that immediately upon reading the book you tend to be hyper sensitive to anything in the news that appears in the slightest fascist it is tempting to see something fascist in all movements you dont like
1203395 sens robert byrd d w va and tom harkin d iowa opposed the confirmation of petraeus while only harkin opposed odierno
1203396 unwillingness to address questions regarding other regional issues such as in afghanistan or iran during his confirmation hearing
1203397 sen harkin opposed these nominations because he does not believe that either gen petraeus or gen odierno will take us in the direction we need in iraq namely setting a timetable for redeployment of u s forces so that our country can begin to more effectively address the very real threat posed by terrorists around the globe
1203398 i am very pleased by the senates bipartisan vote today to confirm general david petraeus as the next commander of u s central command and general raymond odierno to become the commander of multi national forces iraq
1203399 there is no doubt in my mind that general petraeus and general odierno are the two best men to assume these two critically important commands
1203400 general petraeus has won the admiration and respect of the entire country over the past eighteen months
1203401 in addition general odiernos willingness to accept another tour in iraq having only just recently returned to his family in the united states after fifteen months there is a testament to his extraordinary patriotism and inspiring dedication to duty there is no one better qualified to succeed general petraeus in baghdad than general odierno
1203402 irans most recent missile tests demonstrate again the dangers it poses to its neighbors and to the wider region especially israel ballistic missile testing coupled with irans continued refusal to cease its nuclear activities should unite the international community in efforts to counter irans dangerous ambitions irans missile tests also demonstrate the need for effective missile defense now and in the future and this includes missile defense in europe as is planned with the czech republic and poland working with our european and regional allies is the best way to meet the threat posed by iran not unilateral concessions that undermine multilateral diplomacy
1203403 its my understanding that this missile test was conducted by the iranian revolutionary guard this is the same organization that i voted to condemn as a terrorist organization when an amendment was on the floor of the united states senate senator obama refused to vote called it a provocative step
1203404 its in nobodys interest including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region
1203405 soldiers of fortune the rise and fall of the chinese military business complex 1978 1998
1203406 mnd se operates in the southern most part of iraq including the cities of basrah an nasiriyah al amarah the division is headquartered by elements of the british and australian militaries
1203407 essential though it is the military action is secondary to the political one its primary purpose bieng to afford the political power enough freedom to work safely with the population
1203408 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
1203409 instead of any time based approach to any decision for withdrawal its got to be conditions based with the starting point being an intelligence analysis of what might be here today and what might lie ahead in the future i still think we still have work that remains to be done before i can really answer that question
1203410 its very dangerous ill speak for the coalition forces men and women of character and moral courage we have a mission and its not until the mission is done that i can look my leader in the eye and say sir maam mission accomplished and i think it is dangerous to leave anything a little early
1203411 we have the capacity to do a minimum of two and a half brigade combat teams a month can we expand that capacity
1203412 but the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true the strain on our military has grown the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated and weve spent nearly 200 billion more in iraq than we had budgeted iraqs leaders have failed to invest tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues in rebuilding their own country and they have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
1203413 through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have expect that somehow the situation is going to improve
1203414 given the deteriorating situation it is clear at this point that we cannot through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have expect that somehow the situation is going to improve and we have to do something significant to break the pattern that weve been in right now
1203415 my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
1203416 finally in 2006 2007 we started to see that even after an election george bush continued to want to pursue a course that didnt withdraw troops from iraq but actually doubled them and initiated a search and at that stage i said very clearly not only have we not seen improvements but were actually worsening potentially a situation there
1203417 iraq is not the central front in the war on terrorism and it never has been
1203418 the most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war raging in iraq
1203419 i now address my speech to the whole of the islamic nation listen and understand the issue is big and the misfortune is momentous the most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war which the crusader zionist coalition began against the islamic nation it is raging in the land of the two rivers the worlds millstone and pillar is in baghdad the capital of the caliphate
1203420 iraq is in fact the central front of al qaedas global campaign and we devote considerable resources to the fight against al qaeda iraq
1203421 as president i would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in afghanistan we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
1203422 the money is needed here at home for a badly needed school lunch program
1203423 well i was against the war from the beginning but now i am in favor of escalating it
1203424 multi national division center also known as task force mountain assists iraqi security forces with security and stability missions in the area south of baghdad ranging from najaf to wasit provinces mnd center is headquartered by the 10th mountain division light from fort drum new york
1203425 throughout iraq violence is at its lowest level in four years
1203426 the absence of attacks does not necessarily mean you have security
1203427 skill level is pretty high amongst most of the players with juniors starting to filter through to the senior ranks the vikings will play a very attacking running brand of football who are prepared to take risks no real standouts but players have a pretty solid knowledge and understanding of one another with the vikings coming from 3 of the dafl clubs we have a good mixture of experience and youth with about 8 veterans from the 2002 campaign and several players coming through the junior program
1203428 our aim is to be competitive in all our matches and to demonstrate the steady progress of development in denmark by displaying an entertaining brand of football
1203429 all the pools are tough but we feel our group will be particularly hard were expecting south africa to be the obvious big improvers considering the investment in the country over the years by the afl we would not feel disgraced with a 3rd in our pool as long as we are competitive in all matches
1203430 they function well as a team with all players more than familiar with one anothers strengths weaknesses style and habits all have regularly played either together or against each other over several years and with the proximity of clubs have been able to train together more often than most nations
1203431 overall the season was a great success for the league statistics across the board were spectacular and the players provided an incredible couple months of gaming on the complexity side however i am obviously disappointed and ive already begun working for 2009 and beyond
1203432 well of course for me the season for the birmingham salvo was absolutely fantastic and even after a few days i still do not feel that it has completely sunk in we are now home in england and we able to watch the series on sky tv as it is currently showing the finals so we get to bask in our glory again i hope next year we get a longer season with regular season play as this will be useful our players put a lot of effort in over a short period of time compared to the american teams with their full season so our achievement is even more remarkable next year will be tougher as i need to try to hang on to my stars and also i need to win it again that is my challenge and i am looking forward to it
1203433 every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head
1203434 men in a church or outside a church while they are assisting at sacred rites shall be bear headed unless the approved mores of the people or peculiar circumstances of things determine otherwise women however shall have a covered head and be modestly dressed especially when they approach the table of the lord
1203435 universal or particular customs beyond the law which are in force until now are preserved
1203436 laws even invalidating and disqualifying ones do not oblige when there is a doubt about the law
1203437 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1203438 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1203439 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1203440 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1203441 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1203442 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1203443 to create the super sucker biologists modified a system designed for gold dredging seaweed from reefs is sucked up and dumped onto mesh sorting tables on a barge native organisms inadvertently vacuumed are removed and returned to the reef and the seaweed is eventually used by farmers as fertiliser snip the researchers could only remove about 90 of the seaweed so they expected that the algae would grow back necessitating periodic cleaning instead within weeks the remaining seaweed was gone and two years later it has still not returned
1203444 we realised these are distinct locations where you have major complex collisions between continents
1203445 christian haas of the alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research in bremerhaven germany and his team estimated the thickness of late summer ice at the north pole in 2001 2004 and 2007
1203446 it sounds very much like one message for the city and the opposite one for the bush
1203447 this whole scenario just points to one thing and thats that its uneconomical the logging contractors cant afford to work for less than they are and vicforests cant afford to pay them the price that the logging contractors want
1203448 we were a little bit disappointed with the uptake from land holders there wed always like to see as many people bait as possible
1203449 ive built a wall not to block anyone out but to see who loves me enough to climb over it
1203450 dont do anything by half if you love someone love them with all your soul when you go to work work your ass off when you hate someone hate them until it hurts
1203451 hes been there with me side by side shoulder to shoulder hip to hip never toe to toe always seeing eye to eye and dancing cheek to cheek
1203452 minnesotans are not warming up to al franken and with good reason
1203453 on the 10 issues most critical to the bush presidency
1203454 now minnesotans have the opportunity to judge whether or not that close friendship and close partnership has in fact been good for minnesota
1203455 yes i campaigned with the president in 2002 because he was in a position to be of help to the things that were good for minnesota and i tapped into that and its a good thing
1203456 talk to the folks in southeast minnesota after the flood last year talk to the folks about the 35w bridge
1203457 i flew in the next morning the secretary of transportation
1203458 id hate for senator coleman to suggest that things like disaster relief would be partisan and that it would matter whether a democrat or republican were senator to work with the white house
1203459 theyre putting something up clearly intended to deceive voters with the presidential seal giving it the imprimatur of the government
1203460 thats it im not going to read this amp blog anymore
1203461 fighting as with most couples probably most of our fights were not about anything but rather about fighting itself
1203462 todays the day we hoped would never arrive but we knew it inevitably would
1203463 this type of news while its unfortunate for wisconsin were hoping that this kind of raises the alarm a little bid more within minnesota
1203464 but the longer we can keep it out our hope is they can come up with a better ways to fight it
1203465 hes an asshole hes an asshole i know hes my brother dad but hes still an asshole
1203466 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1203467 i dont think anything will be getting out of chicago tonight
1203468 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband
1203469 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away

1203501 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1203502 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1203503 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1203504 he is 99 5 percent perfect id pay to see him
1203505 dont bowl him bad balls he hits the good ones for fours
1203506 its scary where the hell do we bowl to him
1203507 there is no shame being beaten by such a great player we didnt lose to team india we lost to sachin tendulkar
1203508 if ive to bowl to sachin ill bowl with my helmet on he hits the ball so hard
1203509 id like to see him go out and bat one day with a stump i tell you hed do okay
1203510 cricketers like sachin come once in a lifetime and i am privileged he played in my time
1203511 the pressure on me is nothing as compared to sachin tendulkar sachin like god must never fail the crowd always expects him to succeed and it is too much pressure on him
1203512 everybody gets 15 minutes of fame but if theres one person ive admired over a 15 year of period its definitely sachin
1203513 ill be going to bed having nightmares of sachin just running down the wicket and belting me back over the head for six he was unstoppable i dont think anyone apart from don bradman is in the same class as sachin tendulkar he is just an amazing player
1203514 i saw him playing on television and was struck by his technique so i asked my wife to come look at him now i never saw myself play but i feel that this player is playing much the same as i used to play and she looked at him on television and said yes there is a similarity between the two his compactness technique stroke production it all seemed to gel
1203515 in an over i can bowl six different balls but then sachin looks at
1203516 the fact of the matter is that india still need sachin in a big way all this talk of the youngsters taking over is very foolish the reason why tendulkar is so important for the team is because of his ability to inspire others and make them perform under pressure
1203517 commit all your crimes when sachin is batting they will go unnoticed because even the lord will be gone to watch his batting
1203518 kalau tidak nanti kalau kita bercakap dalam dewan kata tidak adil kerana dia tidak ada di situ untuk membela diri dia bagi saya elok dia duduk dalam dewan supaya kita akan dapat secara langsung jawapan daripadanya dalam kes kes tertentu
1203519 kalau dia kat luar dia cakap dalam ceramah dan kita tak boleh nak jawap dalam dewan kita boleh tanya dia lagi baik

1203521 ur a tawt 9 11 waz inside job by bilderburger group
1203522 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within
1203523 when i made the woman she had to be to be made special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly and lastly i gave her a tear to shed this is hers and only hers exclusively to use whenever she needs it she needs no reason no explanation its hers
1203524 the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair the beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides
1203525 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1203526 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events our bill becoming law means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1203527 it is a relief to say that this part of our fight is coming to an end theres still more work to be done and the families arent done fighting for the truth
1203528 there are still a lot of things that we want to know
1203529 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1203530 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1203531 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1203532 one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1203533 entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1203534 while solzhenitsyn accepted putinism the writer always remained the man who embodied openness criticism of the powers that be the powers that putin all his life served
1203535 look around you this is not a country where people cower in fear
1203536 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1203537 the web has faced fragmented video standards for over a decade now
1203538 everyones experienced broken video support whether it be a flash plug in that crashes or an unsupported browser
1203539 if these things were to just work that would be a huge improvement in the browsing experience we will have the same user experience with videos and other multimedia that we currently have with images
1203540 theres the official standards then the kind of force of nature standards
1203541 you get this tipping point a most people use it so i want to use it kind of thing
1203542 eventually the platform represents a significant point and then all of a sudden stuff thats proprietary looks kind of stranded and obsolete
1203543 its not like some magic is going to happen these kind of things tend to move over time kind of like the adoption of the firefox browser itself
1203544 its not like microsoft hasnt used ogg in the past the halo games for pc used ogg vorbis for all of their music for instance
1203545 it would just be present and work and they wouldnt have to fuss about it thats the end goal for open source
1203546 customers asked us to migrate linux and open source further into the data center
1203547 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within
1203548 will solicit donations and donation ideas from individuals and companies within the community and then choose the 10 most promising and unique offerings to auction after the conference dinner
1203549 uses video and online technologies to open the eyes of the world to human rights violations
1203550 there is a feeling that the general public and even some health professionals do not understand type one diabetes and this can have a terribly negative impact on people with the disease
1203551 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1203552 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1203553 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1203554 being called smelly can be damaging to our personality in that sense deodorant products can be used as a confidence booster
1203555 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1203556 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1203557 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1203558 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1203559 one thing i would say about it is this we have the opportunity with the carbon pollution reduction scheme as proposed by the government to get on the path to reducing emissions
1203560 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets mr lewis said
1203561 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between 3 and 4 per cent
1203562 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1203563 how would it be to know that their son is laying somewhere rotting and not being able to finally put him to rest so his family can move
1203564 his brothers are in hell were in hell his cousins all his friends
1203565 he was a much loved boy he was fun loving he would always like a good time he would give the shirt off his back to anybody who needed it
1203566 why someone would do something like this to my son i have no idea
1203567 its like origin state of origin football weve won the first game now we want the series
1203568 if anybody has any idea where matthew may be we need to hear from you
1203569 no evidence and no piece of information that is available is insignificant nothing is irrelevant
1203570 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1203571 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer
1203572 this news today im sure will overcome that problem virtually entirely
1203573 from the point of view of the government department the department of justice it saves us some time and money as well because were not dealing with more than 100 foi application a year
1203574 you can actually get on the map you can see where they are so its giving the public a lot more information
1203575 you can see where the cameras are and secondly if you are a person whos been detected and you believe that you werent speeding and you want to check that the camera has actually been serviced and is accurate all of that information now is available free without having to go to foi
1203576 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
1203577 yes minerva i assure you i was there and i was watching i do realize what it means i just dont know how she could have knowledge of some of those spells
1203578 thats the mystery young mister malfoys knowledge of dueling spells i can understand undoubtedly his father has been hiring private tutors since the boy was old enough to know one end of a wand from the other
1203579 but our mrs potter given their financial situation i doubt her parents could afford a private tutor and besides no tutor i know would teach a child the detonator curse
1203580 i dont know if either of you was keeping track but i did
1203581 she cast what looked like the firespiral charm the dancing curse the tickling charm the bedazzlement charm and the stunning curse all silently then there was that whatever it was a curse i didnt recognize followed by the detonator curse cast verbally so thats one first year spell two third year spells a seventh year spell and a spell that is generally only taught in auror training lets not even mention that shes five years away from being taught how to cast spells silently how is it possible albus
1203582 i have a few theories but unfortunately each is as unlikely as the last
1203583 what has me worried minerva filius isnt ginny weasleys excuse me ginny potters broad spell knowledge its the power she put into them mister malfoys end of the dueling platform was shattered even granting a first year student being able to cast the detonator she shouldnt have been able to cause as much damage with it as she had id expect an effect like that if she was twenty five or thirty certainly but eleven
1203584 well i think we should keep an eye out its clear that she
1203585 severus you look like someone just force fed you a particularly sour lemon
1203586 headmaster i demand that you immediately expel that that girl
1203587 draco malfoy is in the hospital wing right now and madame pomfrey says that it will be days before he walks again and she intentionally disobeyed me by snapping his wand a violent uncontrollable child like that cannot be allowed to endanger
1203588 how dare you suggest may i point out that malfoy brought his injuries on himself it was after all his challenge that sparked this duel if he underestimated his opponent its his own fault and not mrs potters
1203589 perhaps some notice should be made of the manner in which he challenged the girl rather than mister potter himself it was almost as if someone specifically advised him to single out the shall we call her a seemingly softer target than mister potter or that malfoy seemed to know that as head of the potter family mister potter would be forced to either apologize to malfoy or else allow the duel to proceed i somehow doubt malfoy thought of that particular tactic himself
1203590 i have no idea to what either of you are referring if you are implying that i might have been behind this duel
1203591 however minerva does have a point mister malfoy isnt permanently injured no good and he did bring this on himself severus so i think it best if we let things alone hopefully the school will settle down once classes start
1203592 so she wont be punished for disobedience she snapped his wand in
1203593 she snapped his wand in accord with ancient custom regarding duels severus or are you truly saying that had mister malfoy been the victor we wouldnt now be talking about missus potters need to acquire a new wand
1203594 yes well be that as it may no there will be no punishment as nothing occurred that technically could be called a violation of the law or the rules of this school
1203595 and as such i would be very very disappointed in you if you were to take the frustration you feel over this duel out on either of the potters is that clear severus
1203596 call it what you will severus but do not use your authority as a teacher to punish them for anything other than legitimate violations of school rules is that clear
1203597 as crystal since there seems to be no more need for me to be here ill return to my offices
1203598 albus i know you believe differently but i trust that man about as far as i can comfortably spit a live bowtruckle
1203599 severus has my complete confidence filius just as you have
1203600 i think it would be safest for us to take a wait and see attitude regarding ginevra potter if one of you sees an opening to naturally ask a question take it but i dont think pressing the issue would get us very far
1203601 a sound plan albus id hate to think we suspected her of wrong doing shes not misbehaving after all shes just unusual
1203602 thats very true for now lets just treat her as we would any other student
1203603 who knows perhaps the answers we seek will come to us under their own power
1203604 what do we do what do we do what do you mean what do we do we do nothing the last place i will be is in between potter and malfoy nor shall i be standing too close behind that blond imbecile and i am leaving that mail order bride of his alone too what should we do about potter im surprised you blockheads havent learned your lesson already
1203605 potter might be a handful but his girlfriends just a baby shed make an easy target you morons havent you paid attention to anything potter took down the dark lord at 15 months for merlins sake and last year he not only drove him away again he killed the teacher whose job it is to teach defense do you really think he hasnt taught his little crumpet any tricks
1203606 those werent just tricks what business does a firstie have casting those spells where could she have learned the detonator curse or the bedazzlement charm thats not taught until sixth year and that that thing with the two balls of flame whatever that was howd she know how to do that then when ive never heard of the thing there is something very odd about that girl she shouldnt be able to cast the magic she used
1203607 one of you geniuses should have considered the idea that a wizard as magically powerful as potter wouldnt just pick a hayseed from the sticks like weasley for nothing
1203608 and not a one of you thought of it to think you actually call yourselves slytherin
1203609 the lot of you acted like a pack of brainless hufflepuffs draco says jump and youre in the air before asking how high in your thirst to take the down a peg you didnt give any thought at all to the long term consequences of your actions and why loyalty to his highness the blond ponce
1203610 youre what twelve thirteen i suppose youve got all the answers to help us recover from all this
1203611 us what us are you talking about youre a nobody from a nobody family and nobody cares what happens to you
1203612 as for those of us who count yes i do have the answers if taking down potter is so important then we take our time hes a wild card and he always has been you cant react to him like you would to a white knight like oliver wood or a stiff like percy weasley study potter take the time to learn where his soft spots are and what his weaknesses are and when the time is right stick the knife between his ribs while hes not looking
1203613 that is exactly what we should do just wait and see
1203614 why are you surprised parkinson were the house of cunning and forethought remember or were you put here solely because of your ambitions to someday acquire a rich vacuous husband you could wrap around your finger
1203615 my father is going to be so angry with me
1203616 i suppose everyone had been waiting for someone to put the ferret in his place
1203617 you know a ferret long pokey little animal theyre very cute but they have an odd smell and they get into just about everything
1203618 oh because of draco you know malfoy hes the ferret of course
1203619 yeah he does sort of look like a ferret thats brilliant im going to spread that around
1203620 and im sure malfoys going to love you for it neville
1203621 its from my gran probably everything i forgot like my sweater and my spare quills two years in a row and ive forgotten stuff at home my memory is total rubbish
1203622 here are your class schedules for this year good luck to you all
1203623 harry harry potter just the man i wanted to talk to
1203624 ive wanted a word if your little friends would be so kind as to inform professor sprout that youll be a little late theres a lad
1203625 while i certainly appreciate the press appeal of a good scandal when completely managed and manufactured of course i have to say your opening gambit is a bit hazardous dont you think
1203626 always keep in mind harry that the public loves a hero with feet of clay and nothing has brought down more public figures than a sex scandal its wonderful that youve found a bit of crumpet to keep you warm at night if you know what i mean but your choice harry
1203627 harry harry harry what will we do with you you the scion of one of the twelve families and who do you marry a peasants daughter do you really think that was wise harry
1203628 the public doesnt want to see a hero like yourself saddled with some common country wench they expect you to squire about with someone rich and attractive much like yourself that greengrass girl for example or parkinson trust me on this harry for i have some experience men like ourselves who are rich and successful and hugely popular were a cut above the common man
1203629 and the common man expects us to associate with our fellows if we were to wallow among the commons theyd hate us for it so my advice to you harry is to make whatever use you can out of this girl of yours have fun and sew your wild oats but then dump her for someone more attractive
1203630 whats that oh yes my apologies mrs potter may i ask please what exactly are you doing
1203631 the class is supposed to be practicing the lumos charm
1203632 very good er now if i might ask what are these
1203633 those thats just a spell harry made up he says its useful for those times when you need your wand for something other than a i think he called it a fastlight or something
1203634 a spell harry made when you say harry you mean of course harry potter he made that up while only a first year amazing what is the incantation if i might ask
1203635 and say the incantation and it creates a small ball of light like so
1203636 and then i tried the lumospectra charm you know making the light different colors
1203637 after i did that one a couple of times it got boring so i tried this new one
1203638 ah yes that makes perfect sense i suppose well do you think mister potter would mind my learning that interesting new charm and teaching it here at hogwarts
1203639 excellent take thirty points for gryffindor for cleverness and twenty more for showing me a spell i previously did not know i must caution you though my dear do try and not get too far ahead of the rest of the class
1203640 professor mcgonagall called him up to the high table there was something she wanted to discuss with him
1203641 charms class was very instructive thank you again for all your assistance in getting the colored light charm right i do think professor flitwick is perfectly charming hes going to be one of my favorite teachers he doesnt allow personal prejudices to influence his teaching and hes rather competent
1203642 im afraid i dont remember everything that happened in history of magic
1203643 if what happened in your class is like what happens in ours you cant remember because you fell asleep
1203644 youre never going to guess what mcgonagall just told me that fraud bastard lockhart gave me detention and do you know why he said he caught me arriving late to my herbology class funny how that git didnt mention to mcgonagall that he was the bloody reason i was late in the first place merlin
1203645 sorry harry im colin colin creevey im in gryffindor too
1203646 i know all about you of course everybody says you defeated you know who when you were a baby and everything and about how youve got that scar
1203647 yeah well its nice to meet you colin but as you can see im trying to eat lunch and get ready for my next class all right so run along or something
1203648 oh sure harry i was wondering something though if you wouldnt mind when i get my film developed im going to get it done in a potion so the pictures move if you wouldnt mind signing the picture i took of you so i can show my dad and mum ive actually met you ive already told them all about you of course from the books
1203649 harry doesnt give out autographs and he doesnt sign photographs either
1203650 you see colin hes not particularly fond of the reason why hes famous what with it being his parents murder hes too polite to say it but it has to be said please dont bother him about it again all right
1203651 oh im sorry harry i hadnt thought of that ill just
1203652 i hate when that happens being famous is a load of bollocks
1203653 im not hungry anymore i think ill head to class early its time to see what sort of teacher lockhart really is
1203654 wish me luck i get to experience professor snape for the first time anything i should know beforehand
1203655 yeah hes going to want to get back at you for draco
1203656 its potter professor excuse me for saying sir but youve already been reminded of that
1203657 ten points from gryffindor miss weasley and detention for your cheek
1203658 you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making as there is little foolish want waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes
1203659 lovegood ten points from gryffindor for sitting too close to weasley
1203660 and while were at it creevey another ten points from gryffindor for fidgeting in your seat robins ten points from gryffindor for sitting taller than an eleven year old girl has a right to be dinsden ten points for sitting far away from weasley
1203661 now to return to the subject in this classroom i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if youre not the usual bunch of dunderheads i usually have to teach
1203662 i wont i wont i wont you cant make me leave me the fuck alone
1203663 wake up ron youre having a bad dream wake up
1203664 honestly ron i have no idea what your problem is
1203665 the door should be right here shouldnt it the room where we learned magic
1203666 but we can practice spells here real defense spells and we can learn better than we can with lockhart thats for sure
1203667 there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
1203668 thats from hamlet what you do mean by it ginny
1203669 hermione can find all kinds of new spells in the library and she can show them to us and ginny i mean you could show us those hexes you used on malfoy right i figure since bill or charlie taught them to you they arent secrets right
1203670 no its not going to be hermione or me teaching spells its going to be harry it has to be harry
1203671 because because i dont know why because but it has to be
1203672 and we cant allow umbridge to know about this place
1203673 how is it possible that a room of such size is able to fit in hogwarts
1203674 i wonder if the hogwarts elves would be able to catalog all of this
1203675 but you said one of those weird things again harry
1203676 i call dibs on the carpet blimey ive always wanted to fly on one of those
1203677 are you sure were supposed to be here should we touch these things
1203678 im going to go look for another one my gran always tells me about how her parents had one when she was little
1203679 it wasnt so hard the first time i can do it again
1203680 i think it might be a bit big for me
1203681 relax hermione you dont have to be perfect all the time you know
1203682 i see her grace hermione the duchess of granger is very underdressed
1203683 those horrible black robes what would prince harry lord ronald and the duke of longbottom say
1203684 that doesnt seem like a very macho thing to do to me
1203685 and there you go again why dont you go do macho things and leave us girls to play dress up
1203686 you really say the oddest things sometimes luna just like harry and ginny
1203687 well i suppose and i think that for right now when youre only thirteen years old you should wear earth tones you arent ready for scarlet and black yet
1203688 you need to put your duchess dress on your grace
1203689 still he doesnt really know what hes doing does he
1203690 my mum and i we used to play all the time sometimes even daddy would play the king or the knight or the cow wizard it was always a great deal of fun didnt your parents play with you
1203691 my mother bought me dolls every year for christmas and my birthday but i wasnt to play with them they were porcelain you know and ever so expensive theyre in a cabinet actually theyre all still in their boxes
1203692 whats the fun in getting presents if you cant play with them
1203693 my parents they were a little older when they had me i dont think they expected me actually and theyve both got very demanding careers theyre both dentists and they always sort of expected me to be like them frankly i dont know how they reacted to me being a witch we got the letter and professor flitwick explained everything they didnt say anything until the next day and that was only to tell me that i ought to prepare myself for school
1203694 we went to diagon alley to get my school things and they told me that i should prepare myself for first year they recommended memorizing the texts actually
1203695 though i think it has more to do with your natural talent than your ability to memorize me im barely even a wizard
1203696 youre the one who won us the house cup last year
1203697 only because you put the body bind curse on me
1203698 you could have told me it was you know who that you were going after
1203699 is there something that boys like to play on the ground
1203700 i think it would be too unfair if i was on someones team neither one of you seem to know much about warfare and i learned painfully from the twins
1203701 though im not sure you should harry youre better than us
1203702 thinks that we should stay as far away as possible from the warring king lord and duke
1203703 she touched a tiara luna handed it to her and it just started burning her then luna threw it away
1203704 it seems like something i should know doesnt it i wish you hadnt thrown that tiara luna id like to smash it
1203705 if its any consolation ginny did as much damage to it as it did to her
1203706 i saw it it had started to melt where she was touching it
1203707 couldnt you have i dont know not managed to get yourself hurt we were having fun
1203708 can we can we just go to madam pomfrey now
1203709 everyone clear out ginnys got to get her school robes back on
1203710 fred george that could have been dangerous someone could have stepped on him
1203711 i just i just came to say that well that is to say ahem im sorry
1203712 i admit i was wrong i was wrong this whole time i should have been with you but i wasnt and for that im sorry
1203713 youre a weasley after all wouldnt have been able to stay away from your real family for long
1203714 or is the minister still to come in and ask for harrys whereabouts
1203715 im here on my own the minister doesnt know it
1203716 look ive realized that what i did was wrong i stood on the wrong side and for that i am really sorry for not being here for not being here when you needed me im sorry for that
1203717 im here to say that ill be here when you need me from now on ill be here to help
1203718 you have to trust my word there is nothing else i can say to convince you
1203719 i can be your inside source to the minister i can tell you what he plans to do and i can influence his decisions myself his decisions can come partly from the order without it being in danger of being found out
1203720 was it your influence percy which led to the ministrys decisions to have harry as their mascot
1203721 fred stay out of this this is not a decision for you to make
1203722 i dont know what i should say to you that decision is not mine to make either
1203723 but the decision to accept you back into this family is mine as well as your mothers you may be our son by blood but you havent behaved as a son should your mother and i well have to discuss it
1203724 i remember this one i used to read it to you at bedtime
1203725 well you should go to sleep mums going to go mad if were late tomorrow
1203726 its because i dont think hell miss me like ill miss him
1203727 and besides its his loss if he doesnt write to you hes the one whos going to miss our baby sister growing up
1203728 anyway ill read you this story but after that you have to promise to go to sleep alright
1203729 once upon a time there was a boy named harry potter who lived in a great white castle in the land of godrics hollow he was a prince and a hero loved by many and the only child of queen lily and king james
1203730 i dont know maybe she has maybe she knows someone that has or maybe she hasnt and shes just going off of what the rumors say does it matter anyway ginny
1203731 well then with eyes as red as blood and skin as white as
1203732 well probably considering hes the one who defeated you know who
1203733 do you think hell remember what you know who looks like
1203734 i mean he was so young when you know who was defeated do you think he really remembers what you know who would look like its been such a long time after all
1203735 why does it matter ginny gone and hes not coming back theres no reason for harry potter to remember him anyway now if you would stop interrupting me i could finish the story and we could actually get enough sleep before getting ready tomorrow morning
1203736 ahem where was i oh yeah skin as white as the skull it clung to he had a plan to bring down the prince and so with his faithful servants ever at his side he strode into the kingdom brandishing both sword and wand
1203737 as the people of godrics hollow saw him approach with his vast army they ran to the castle for shelter where they knew their hero slept peacefully
1203738 a bright flash of gold and red passed through the castle doors
1203739 i dont want any death eaters messing around my pub when ive said im closing
1203740 you were supposed to be meeting me on high street in front of the tower
1203741 yeah well i decided it wouldnt be how dyou ministry folk say it prudent at this time in the evening
1203742 thought i might have to run out and tell you to follow me for all the brains you were showing
1203743 out with it boy we dont have all day curfews going to be set soon
1203744 i came here to join the order of the phoenix
1203745 theres nothing left of it no one is willing to risk their safety in openly rebelling against you know who
1203746 its not there anymore is there any other way to spell it out to you
1203747 i thought you were supposed to be the smart one in the bunch albus said you were the only one to make it into the ministry
1203748 if i had been the smart one i would never have joined it
1203749 anyway i need to know that my family is safe can you do that aberforth can you let me know when they need help you said you knew the whereabouts of most of the members in the order when i last met you
1203750 last i heard of em they were alright but its been days since ive heard anything at all
1203751 do you have any contact at all with people inside hogwarts
1203752 if this is to do with your sister shes fine last i heard of her she tried to steal gryffindors sword from snapes office
1203753 that sister of yours is a real troublemaker she got off real easy just a detention i heard shell be safe as long as mcgonagalls around
1203754 if thats all you came to say then youd better get going its getting darker by the second
1203755 go boy if the death eaters catch sight of you theyll never let your family be in peace go
1203756 but just give me your word tell me youll let me know when its time to fight
1203757 i will now go before they set up the caterwauling charms
1203758 theyve started potters at hogwarts and voldemorts coming soon i can feel it
1203759 ill be there as soon as i can in your pub through the portrait
1203760 hurry up and get here all your brothers have already been through dont want to be left out do ya
1203761 well go into london tomorrow morning and meet ron and hermione
1203762 then well all pop down to the burrow for dinner and you and your mum can start planning the wedding
1203763 gee i think ive seen just about everything there is to see
1203764 remember what i told you about your stag well theres a lot more
1203765 i guess its our patronus now i wonder what happens if you summon yours
1203766 she said with the memory of what she and harry had been doing to each other half an hour ago fixed in her mind
1203767 you and i will populate the world with magical creatures
1203768 i will but i have to admit i like the idea as a future project
1203769 itll be fun when we decide to do it but i have a tryout with the harpies in the spring and then i have a wedding in the summer i want to be able to fit into quidditch robes and a killer wedding gown
1203770 ill talk to percy over the holiday and see if i can get in the auror program itll be a pain to disapparate down there every day but maybe i can stay with ron and hermione a few days during the week
1203771 but i really dont like the idea of hooking my home up like that at least not until they find turquoise southeby
1203772 so ask mcgonagall to let you use one of the fireplaces at school she owes you big time
1203773 thats an idea i hadnt thought of yeah ill talk to her next week
1203774 then i can keep sending you mash notes and sleep in my own bed every night
1203775 how did i get so lucky to have you fall in love with me
1203776 youre a good kisser especially when youve just gotten out of detention
1203777 i always wanted to see how much i could make in tips
1203778 so whats up youre going down to london this morning right
1203779 but theres something i want to ask you how would you like to take over running the inn after christmas
1203780 im going to enroll in the auror training program the same one that rons in i cant run the inn if im doing that so someone has to take over for me id like you to do it
1203781 ill still live in the flat and eat here but all the profits will be yours the ministryll pay me while im in the program so i wont need any gold
1203782 arry do you mind if i go out for a few minutes
1203783 go ahead ill help ginny out at the bar well split the tips
1203784 we have a love potion special today guaranteed to make redheads fall in love with you
1203785 he ran out of here like he had bowtruckles in his pants
1203786 he went to tell harriet that hes running the inn now
1203787 he got into it a long time ago did you see my ring
1203788 ill do that tomorrow ill be around all day in case theres a problem with them i dont think there will be though youve all been getting along pretty good havent you
1203789 as far as i can tell but you never know with those two maybe they wont like taking orders from me
1203790 theyll have to and anyway ill still be here most of the time
1203791 if its a problem ill find some way to work it out
1203792 i nicked everything i could about the training program we can go over it before lunch
1203793 if percy will let me i guess ill have lots of catching up to do
1203794 its all here the whole bloody course all the lesson plans the test questions we had field assignments everything dont tell perce about it if i put it all back on monday he wont notice a thing
1203795 youre training to be an auror and you start off by stealing lesson plans from the ministry
1203796 im not stealing im borrowing besides theyll be so glad to see harry they wouldnt notice if i vanished all the desks well percy might he wouldnt have anything to shuffle his paperwork on
1203797 i know half of this stuff already you did most of it last year when we were on the run hermione
1203798 actually saliyah has asked me to join the department and i havent ruled it out
1203799 all those things that happened to you and harry have made me think a lot the work at the institute is fascinating i really love it but im not sure it will ever make a difference it certainly wouldnt have prevented harry from being poisoned
1203800 but i thought you were trying to find a way to detect unforgivable curses
1203801 i was i mean i am but do you know how many of them are used in a typical year i dont mean last year when riddle and people like lestrange were using them left and right before that say five years ago as best as we can tell there were maybe five or six a year in the whole country and most of those were imperios used by people trying to get someone to fall in love with them honestly
1203802 no i want to help kingsley fix things i want to join the magical law enforcement office
1203803 percys more or less running it now and hes very efficient but
1203804 hes really not very good at dealing with people i mean his hearts in the right place finally but hes like pester in some ways he rubs people the wrong way
1203805 i know what youre all thinking youre thinking hermione can also be a very annoying person and maybe youre right sometimes ronald
1203806 but i didnt say i want to run the office i only want to work there
1203807 he just doesnt want to think that he could end up working for me someday
1203808 ill never be head auror so harry or somebody will be your boss not me
1203809 fine ron youll be head auror which means if im ever head of the office youll be working for me but you can relax ive never been known to run around emasculating wizards
1203810 cross that bridge when we come to it eh mate
1203811 but shes right about being able to do some good there
1203812 ron and i want to do something special to celebrate your engagement
1203813 no incantation no wand just my ring and thats not all my own patronus has changed to a doe
1203814 snapes and my guess is that my mums wasnt a doe at first either but it became one when she and my dad got engaged but isnt that brilliant
1203815 i always wondered why yours was a horse ginny did you want one for christmas
1203816 i wanted a pony when i was little and you wanted a dog right
1203817 if you think about it theres quite a bit of magic in patronuses that we or at least i dont know about dumbledore discovered how to use them to communicate snape used his to lead harry to the sword of gryffindor they are extremely powerful as harry showed when his fought off all those dementors so it shouldnt be surprising that a patronus can transfer some of its own magic into another magical object
1203818 we should go back to the jewelry store where you got this harry and try to find out where the rubies came from
1203819 ive been in it a couple of times they have a very elegant and very expensive selection
1203820 so do you want to take a look at this stuff
1203821 no love you three do this i think id like to go see george i havent really talked to him in a while you know its been half a year when youre done come downstairs and well go
1203822 thats agatha tright her parents own a jewelry shop down the block she was in our my year in ravenclaw nice kid kind of quiet shes interested in african magic that was a nigerian headless scarf she just bought
1203823 were now stocking headless hats scarves helmets earmuffs and nose plugs
1203824 right see you put them in your nose before you go swimming then when youre underwater you activate them by pinching your nose and your head disappears its guaranteed to freak out anyone else in the pool
1203825 so what brings you downstairs is everything okay up there
1203826 harrys going to join the auror program dont tell anyone though especially percy harry doesnt want the word to get out yet ron nicked copies of the course material from the ministry and harrys looking at them now
1203827 wow thats brilliant i mean about harry not about ron
1203828 i never really thought that harry would like running a business hes not patient enough he needs immediate results you know expelliarmus and then the wars over
1203829 i dont know what to do ginny i want him to stay and i want him to go away but if he goes im afraid ill go with him
1203830 were about to start selling crying cream lee must have smeared some on the doorknob this morning
1203831 no not much i guess were both hiding our heads in the sand i see angelina sometimes and we have a drink in the leaky cauldron she talks and i listen shes doing better than i am maybe thats why
1203832 i should talk i know actually thats all i ever do is talk but not about him when i start talking about him i turn around because i think i heard him say something but its myself im hearing i make jokes and i act stupid because when im doing that for an instant hes here hes about to finish off the wisecrack then i wait for it and theres nothing he never finishes the joke itll never be finished again
1203833 i know im not the only one who feels like this mum tries to hide it but i catch her staring at me and i know why shes doing it sometimes i actually think about becoming a shape shifter so i can stop looking like him
1203834 im sorry you came all the way into town just to listen to me blubber
1203835 you know i cant remember a single time when he and i cried together like this sometimes one of us would get really steamed at the other and start screaming and crying but then one of us would start laughing and then both of us would be laughing
1203836 well all be there mum wants to start planning the wedding but ill bet you twenty galleons that she already knows exactly how everythings going to be
1203837 maybe i was going to have dinner with angelina but ill see if she wants to do that instead it would be nice to talk about a wedding instead of you know
1203838 can i interest anyone in some top secret documents from the ministry of magic theyre right upstairs and i can let you have them for really cheap im very close to an insider who can put his very sticky fingers on anything even kingsley shacklebolts laundry list
1203839 i didnt know you were interested in kingsleys knickers george
1203840 have a nice time kids dont stay out too late
1203841 and bring your fianc ill take you both out to dinner
1203842 and come tonight with angelina i havent seen her since my party
1203843 we talked for fifteen minutes about fred and he never once said his name hes haunted harry i get moments when i think about fred and i feel overwhelmed but george is always in one of those moments
1203844 ah mr potter its good to see you again and this is the young lady
1203845 miss weasley its so nice to meet you im abraham tright mr potter never stopped talking about you when he was here i didnt think anyone could outshine the ring he bought but i have to admit that i was wrong
1203846 thank you its the most beautiful thing ive ever owned
1203847 pardon me miss weasley may i look at it the rubies
1203848 there is an identical imperfection in each ruby something ive never seen before
1203849 its not a flaw its something else and thats why we wanted to see you
1203850 no no it wasnt anything like that something magical happened to it mr tright we wanted to ask if if
1203851 where the rubies came from and if theres any reason to think that they were magical before you sold them to harry
1203852 i am absolutely certain that these gems were not magical when i sold them to mr potter we take great pride and care in selling only the purest and most perfect gems weve sold hundreds of rubies and never had a complaint if a customer comes in here and says he or she wants a magical gem we send them down to knockturn alley where they can buy any kind of rubbish they want
1203853 how can that be ive never even heard of such a thing why did it touch the ring
1203854 i held my hand out to it and it touched the ring with its nose
1203855 please dont be upset ginny and i really dont mind that she can summon my patronus we just wanted to make sure that there isnt something else that we dont know about its a beautiful ring and were very happy with it
1203856 but please dont tell anyone about it we dont want to attract attention
1203857 i imagine you of all people wouldnt want attention discretion is part of my business mr potter no one outside this room will hear about your ring from me so mr weasley
1203858 when will you be in the market for a token for your own young lady friend
1203859 i dont need anything expensive sweetie and mr tright do you know where the rubies came from
1203860 its my daughter agatha shes very interested in african culture and shes also a very accomplished dancer if i may say so she dances with an ensemble that performs around the country
1203861 she was in the show we saw at the ministry last summer
1203862 we still dont know whats going on with the rubies
1203863 lets duck in here i think i know where to look itll only take a minute
1203864 she buys so many books they roll out the red carpet whenever she walks in
1203865 what a pleasure we havent seen you since yesterday are you looking for something special
1203866 actually i just want to look something up in roundstones magical gems of the world its right over there
1203867 mione knows where every damn book in the store is
1203868 so whenever she asks for something one of these clerks writes down where she told them to get it from they figure in another six months theyll have the whole place catalogued
1203869 theres a mine in the highlands of northern burma that only the local wizards know about
1203870 well i saw it only about five years ago when i was here to buy my school books i noticed the binding so i picked it up and leafed through it
1203871 it sounds like it could do more magic if we knew how
1203872 if someone as knowledgeable as mr tright didnt know about it it must require quite powerful magic to make something happen
1203873 theyre doing that play with the old witches in it
1203874 we saw it when we were kids do you remember ginny
1203875 yes and mum had to keep shushing me because i was cracking up so much those witches were so funny
1203876 the witches werent funny this time just strange i suppose you have to consider that shakespeare probably didnt know any real ones at least they got the clothes more or less right
1203877 but they had the potion completely wrong shouldnt it have been dried dragon pancreas in it instead of newts eye
1203878 i heard youre enlisting in percys auror training program thats wonderful news kingsleys going to be very pleased when he hears about it
1203879 i tried to keep it a secret but now your whole family seems to know
1203880 were a very tight lipped family no one else knows yet
1203881 yes i want to stay near ginny and until they find out who did the dark marks and those other things i dont want to leave it alone at night even with the aurors on guard
1203882 how will you commute do you have a connection to the floo network its a much easier way to travel than apparating to the staff entrance of the ministry
1203883 no im not connected ginny suggested that i could use a fireplace at the school
1203884 well i think i can help you there do you remember a few years ago when we came to your aunts place and brought you here i had a friend on the floo regulation panel who arranged that and the chap is now in charge of the whole network why dont you let me put in a word with him i think you have a pretty good case for getting a high security connection you wouldnt have to worry about anyone slipping in who wasnt supposed to
1203885 how does that security work would someone from say hogwarts be able to use it if i wanted them to
1203886 you mean if you wanted her to yes you can set it up however you want its all controlled by the floo regulation panel which was one of the few offices that the death eaters didnt bollix up they didnt put any of their incompetent toadies on it it was too important as long as the technicians did what they were told they were left alone
1203887 lets take a walk like we used to do last summer
1203888 you were talking about who was going to sit where
1203889 harry well have everyone sit wherever they want no one cares

1203929 soon the rehearsals for the tour will take place in mexico i am looking forward to see how
1203930 one of the personal highlights of the tour will be definitely the return to guadalajara mexico as some of you might know some nasty bad things happened there to me many years ago while performing on stage
1203931 before the tour still next week i am going to spend it in los angeles

1204141 older patients with dementia who are given antipsychotic medicines are far more likely to die prematurely than those given dummy pills federal drug regulators said monday
1204142 zyprexa and symbyax from eli lilly risperdal from johnson amp johnson seroquel from astrazeneca abilify from bristol myers squibb clozaril from novartis and geodon from pfizer are all affected by this warning
1204143 the food and drug administration said that it had analyzed the results of 17 placebo controlled trials involving the drugs which are known as atypical antipsychotics the agency found that elderly patients with demetia who were given the pills were 1 6 to 1 7 times as likely to die as those given placebos
1204144 complicating this widespread use in april 2005 the fda issued a public health advisory warning that newer or atypical antipsychotic medications nearly doubled the risk of death among elderly patients
1204145 the researchers identified those given conventional antipsychotics such as haldol or thorazine and atypical drugs such as risperdal and zyprexa
1204146 in this important study bwh brigham and womens hospital researchers found that patients prescribed conventional antipsychotic drugs had a 37 percent higher risk of death in the short term than among those to whom atypical medications were prescribed
1204147 in the first 180 days of use 17 9 percent of patients on conventional antipsychotic medications died as compared with 14 6 percent of those taking atypical agents the greatest increase in risk of death among conventional versus atypical drug users occurred with higher doses and during the first 40 days after starting threrapy
1204148 first generation and newer classes of antipsychotic medications may increase risk of death among elderly fda black box warnings should also include first generation medications
1204149 people with serious mental illness served by our public mental health system die on average 25 years earlier than the general population
1204150 however with time and experience the second generation antipsychotic medications have become more highly associated with weight gain diabetes dyslipidemia insulin resistence and metabolic syndrome
1204151 psychotropic medications may mask symptoms of medical illness and contribute to symptoms of medical illness and cause metabolic syndrome
1204152 the number of neuroleptic drugs prescribed at the time of the baseline survey was related to the subsequent mortality of people with schizophrenia taking one two and three or more neuroleptic drugs 11 35 15 44 and 8 57 respectively died during follow up whereas the corresponding rate was 5 20 among those without neuroleptic medication
1204153 the present study demonstrated a graded relationship between the number of neuroleptic drugs prescribed and mortality of those with schizophrenia this relationship and the excess mortality among people with schizophrenia could not be explained by coexistent somatic diseases or other known risk factors for premature death
1204154 the drugs most widely used to manage aggressive outbursts in intellectually disabled people are no more effective than placebos for most patients and may be less so researchers report
1204155 the finding being published friday sharply challenges standard medical practice in mental health clinics and nursing homes in the united states and around the world
1204156 the new study tracked 86 adults with low iqs in community housing in england wales and australia over more than a month of treatment it found a 79 percent reduction in aggressive behavior among those taking dummy pills compared with a reduction of 65 percent or less in those taking antipschotic drugs
1204157 the researchers focused on two drugs risperdal by janssen and an older drug haldol but said the findings almost certainly applied to all similar medications
1204158 antipsychotic drugs frequently used in nursing homes to treat aggression in alzheimers patients dont provide benefit and seem to lead to marked decline in ability a report says
1204159 the study published in the april issue of the journal public library of science medicine adds to a long line of evidence suggesting such drugs arent safe in elderly patients and dont work very well when used off label
1204160 often an underlying medical problem such as an untreated urinary tract infection causes an alzheimers patient to behave aggressively jacoby says
1204161 jacoby and his colleagues studied 165 people with severe alzheimers living in nursing homes in four cities in great britain where the drugs also are heavily used the patients had been taking an anti psychotic drug such as thioridazine chlorpromazine haloperidol trifluoperazin or risperidone for at least three months the researchers took half the patients off the medication and gave them placebo pills the other half kept taking the medication
1204162 after six months the researchers found that patients who kept taking the anti psychotic drugs showed a significant deterioration in their ability to speak fluently alzheimers ultimately destroys the brains language centers but the study suggests the drugs might speed up that process and leave patients increasingly isolated nixon says
1204163 krishna devi a woman he had treated years ago for schizophrenia sat in a courtyard surrounded by religious pictures exposed brick walls and drying laundry devi had stopped taking medication years ago but her articulate speech and easy smile were eloquent testimony that she had recovered from the debilitating disease
1204164 few schizophrenia patients in the united states are so lucky even after years of treatment but devi had hidden assets a doting family and an embracing village that never excluded her from socal events family obligations and work
1204165 devi is a living reminder of a remarkable three decade long study by the world health organization one that many western doctors initially refused to believe people with schizophrenia a deadly illness characterized by hallucinations disorganized thinking and social withdrawal typically do far better in poorer nations such as india nigeria and colombia than in denmark england and the united states
1204166 the astounding result calls into question one of the central tenets of modern psychiatry that a brain disease such as schizophrenia is best treated by hospitals drugs and biomedical interventions
1204167 social networks healing power is borne out in poorer nations
1204168 people diagnosed with schizophrenia who are not on antipsychotics are more likely to experience recovery than those taking medication according to an american study
1204169 over 15 years schizophrenia patients not on antipsychotics showed more periods of recovery than those taking antipsychotics states a research paper in last months
1204170 researchers reported that after 10 years 79 of patients on antipsychotics were psychotic whereas 23 of those not on medication were psychotic after 15 years 65 per cent of patients on antipsychotics were psychotic whereas only 28 of those not on medication were psychotic
1204171 people with schizophrenia not taking antipsychotics more likely to recover states research
1204172 on september 14 1989 joseph t westbecker a forty seven year old pressman returned to standard gravure his former place of work in louisville kentucky and shot 20 of his co workers killing eight and injuring twelve before committing suicide in front of the pressroom supervisors office
1204173 it was discovered soon afterward that westbecker had been taking a course of the antidepressant prozac thus eli lilly of indianapolis the manufacturer and distributor of the drug became a prime target in a subsequent liability suit brought by the survivors and trelatiives of the dead
1204174 one item involved a november 1990 report by the german affiliate chief claude bouchy expressing his great concerns in response to the request of lilly executives that the phrase suicidal ideation be changed to depression in data on suicidality i do not think i could explain to the bga the german governments drug regulatory body to a judge to a reporter or even to my family why we would do this the document read especially on the issue of sensitive issue of suicide and suicidal ideation at least not with the explanations that have been given our staff so far
1204175 eventually zettler asked do you have any criticisms about the way the data from overseas was gathered and reported
1204176 lord let this sink in for a moment first of all she continued how are they to know the investigator thought it was a suicide attempt they said well they dont think it is the british and the danish she added were similarly concerned about safety but lilly reacted in a like manner
1204177 after the court reconvened zettler again asked about the effect of concomitant medications in prozacs clinical trials various witnesses had tackled this question before but lords approach loaded with qualifying detail was devastating
1204178 to simply sedate them make those things adverse events less of a problem and then not report them was in my opinion improper she said to a hushed court
1204179 attempts to deny the existence of a financial settlement were finally swept away in july when it was revealed that plaintiff andrew pointer shot by joseph westbecker on prozac in the tunnel between standard gravure and the
1204180 six depressed patients free of recent serious suicidal ideation developed intense violent suicidal preoccupation after 2 7 weeks of fluoxetine treatment the state persisted for as little as 3 days to as long as 3 months after discontinuation of fluoxetine none of these patients had ever experienced a similar state during treatment with any other psychotropic drug

1204228 there was suspicion among many in the arab world and among parts of the american public that the united states had gone to war in iraq precisely to secure the oil wealth these contracts seek to extract
1204229 to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of united states armed forces in iraq
1204230 to exercise united states control of the oil resources of iraq

1204232 clearly supported prime minister maliki and the iraqi government against what they described as illegal armed groups of moktadas mahdi army in the recent conflict in basra
1204233 which is not surprising given that their main proxy in iraq the supreme iraqi islamic council dominates the iraqi state and is malikis main backer

1204259 compassion is a mind that removes the suffering that is present in the other we can nurture the unconditional love that does not expect anything in return and therefore does not lead to anxiety and sorrow
1204260 we have to find ways to nourish and express our compassion when we come into contact with the other person our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion even if that person says and does things that are not easy to accept we practice in this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person being lovable

1204321 serious questions have arisen about the accuracy and reliability of new electronic voting machines
1204322 its imperative that congress does everything it can to help ensure that votes cast are recorded accurately
1204323 stemming from poor design inferior software engineering processes mediocre protective measures and insufficient comprehensive testing
1204324 e voting systems enable voters to inspect a physical e g paper record to verify the accuracy of their vote and to serve as an independent check on the record produced and stored by the system
1204325 in the state of utah we feel very good about what we have got and it does not qualify under this bill it would have to be thrown out after a lot of research a lot of work and a lot of money to put it in place and our experience with it in an election and it worked then we would say okay you have to throw it out i know i would get significant resistance because they would say demonstrate that what we have got is not working before you insist that we have to throw it away
1204326 provide for the independent verification of each ballot cast by means of a paper electronic audio video pictorial or other independently produced record
1204327 verifying by electronic records having one piece of software attest that another piece of software is honest is not verifying at all

1204333 governor you said 18 months experience wasnt enough experience as governor to be the vice president would you want to contrast that with the 143 days experience obama as senator before he decided he had enough experience to be president
1204334 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong

1204383 but we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages

1204391 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1204392 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1204393 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1204394 in africa 11 of the 13 kinds of red colobus monkeys assessed were listed as critically endangered or endangered
1204395 two may already be extinct bouviers red colobus has not been seen in 25 years and no living miss waldrons red colobus has been seen by a primatologist since 1978 despite occasional reports that some still survive
1204396 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1204397 and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1204398 however the slayings of eight mountain gorillas in 2007 and continuing political turmoil in the region delayed the planned reclassification
1204399 the necessary measures will be taken if anyone is found to be at fault

1204422 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
1204423 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1204522 to me and to many of the survivors this museum has become way too clean and pretty and not shocking
1204523 when this museum was opened in 1955 it was much more shocking and it has been gradually cleaned up and made more like a professional museum
1204524 when you go through here you should be shocked you should be frightened
1204525 as i get older i feel more strongly that we have to hand down our experiences to the next generation the message that war is horrible
1204526 on the day of the bombing my father immediately went to the centre of the city to save and search for people but he didnt say a word about it before he died in 1988

1204531 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1204547 the proposed scheme will provide direct benefits to upper south island communities and indirect benefits to the rest of new zealand through the freeing up of electricity currently imported into that region for more efficient use elsewhere

1204557 the scientific community is really going to run with this

1204563 i think thats been going on for quite some time
1204564 i think we just have to acknowledge and accept that desperate times call for desperate measures and the reality is that were going to see all sorts of people playing all sorts of games and doing different things
1204565 at the end of the day it doesnt excuse us were on the record twenty four seven weve just got to accept that this is going to be a pretty robust election campaign
1204566 there is always the possibility of what we say to anybody maybe picked up spun around and end up on the front page of a newspaper
1204567 so the key thing is to be saying in private what you do in public i think that is where mr english has been caught out
1204568 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
1204569 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
1204570 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
1204571 its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds

1204580 as millions of americans look to unload their gas guzzlers which puts money in their pockets and reduces the need for expensive gasoline
1204581 theres a change in the nature of why theyre getting loans yesterday half the loans went to people who needed gas money some said it was just to get to work the gas prices are killing them
1204582 they turned to us to get them over the potholes in the road not anymore now its for survival
1204583 our economy is so bad the only thing im taking now are motorcycles rolexes gold dvds snowmobiles some original art jet skis some cars things unique enough we can sell for a low price
1204584 i dont want your laptops your generators we only take two out of 10 things that walk in the door
1204585 this past years volume of items for sale and the volume of dollars were taking out is so much bigger than before
1204586 when youre making a lot of money you live big
1204587 it was my sons idea to take this stuff to a pawnshop
1204588 shes a prime example of the people were seeing now
1204589 lots of upper middle class people who are short 50 or 60 bucks
1204590 i sold it for 50 i needed gas to take my son to school what else could i do
1204591 i remember hearing stories of the family and the things they had to do and sacrifices they had to make like not being able to buy a new pair of shoes and always having to get secondhand things during the depression
1204592 if anyone would understand my having to sell this ring my grandmother would
1204593 he used it only twice but if it can get us food on the table its one of those things we dont need
1204594 has significant value as far as emotional attachment but i have to do what i have to do i will always have the memory

1204596 most of the time one of us holds him and one feeds him
1204597 and it seems the government doesnt care i cried last night for a good hour i just cried because i dont know what were going to do
1204598 gas stamps at 42 cents and kids arent getting any cheaper
1204599 i want to raise my family like i never got to be raised we live in a ghetto neighborhood with gang violence and all that i want to move my family out of that
1204600 its not that i dont value it its that i value eating and driving more
1204601 we sold our condo after the property taxes blew up
1204602 we dont drive as much we cut down on our food bill and use coupons we havent bought clothes in a while we dont get a lot of extras like ice cream just the necessities fruit and vegetables and meat the cheap cuts
1204603 makes me want to move maybe to northern idaho its so expensive here
1204604 i suspect that there are a number of parents whose kids teeth just fall through the cracks
1204605 if your bodys not a hundred per cent one of the early places where things show up is in your mouth
1204606 im looking after my adult patients who now have kids i dont want them taking their kids somewhere else i want them to be happy where they are
1204607 im not chasing work believe me but the disciplines you start as a teenager are going to carry through life
1204608 what you do after 18 is you own business but theres reason that you cant have good teeth up to 18 under the new zealand system
1204609 there are two issues that the sector is grappling with one is the relatively low number of dentists the other is the relatively low recognition by teenagers of the services available the combination means that the coverage is quite low
1204610 weve put in a joint business case between ourselves and capital and coast which is with the ministry of health now which looks to establish some extra capacity for the whole thing
1204611 one of them was to supplement this programme contracted private dentists not to do away with it not act in opposition but to supplement it with some employed dentists
1204612 undiagnosed orthodontic problems can limit future options for children having an attractive smile effective chewing or easily cleaned teeth poor oral
1204613 children begin life threatening habits such as smoking cigarettes or cannabis in adolescence and need the advice of dentists who identify it some diseases of the mouth that children may think are inconsequential are contagious
1204614 people can survive without teeth but for most it is an unhappy loss

1204623 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1204624 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1204625 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1204626 sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1204627 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1204628 there is nothing dead in the water at the moment because reviews are taking place over the next 12 months and we are happy for all options to be included happy for any suggestions to come forward from any people whether it is players sponsors provincial unions or franchises

1204631 obama has a lovely skin tone very similar to the glistening color of oil he puts oil rich nations at ease with his beautiful sweet crude skin
1204632 our trends show that with current conditions bent to conform to the existing oil markets prices should begin reducing 25 in the fourth quarter with a drastic total drop of at least 100 in the second quarter of 2009 as long as he doesnt get ashy under all this election stress
1204633 mccains got that blotchy pale ass skin thats the skin of pestilence and death no one trusts a white dude with skin like that
1204634 the children were not with him at the time he was taken into custody and that was a great concern for us
1204635 we didnt know where those kids were but thankfully the kids are ok and they are in the custody of their mother
1204636 the suspect was only in the store for a matter of seconds maybe a minute but not very long at all
1204637 we dont know exactly how long it was that the clerk was in there before the customer found him
1204638 i liked the person a lot i liked the time we spent with him and i thought that hed be a great guy to give a chance to he sort of built up his career in collge and those guys usually have a way of finding a home
1204639 its a celebration of his life not of his passing what better way to celebrate it i wish i could be there but to get the family together and do something for other people so we dont really have anything set up where people could donate
1204640 if you remember just those people in need and take a second to help them out whether its something as small as some socks or toiletries its pretty dramatic the difference between where a lot of us are and where a lot of other people are in terms of their luck and their situation
1204641 so in honor of him if you could remember someone else or help someone else that would mean a lot to me personally

1204645 so firstly how are you enjoying the french lifestyle i noticed that you have a baguette in your bag clearly you are relishing the cultural delights here in france
1204646 certainly as you can see france is a place rich in history the food is so full of flavour and the wine well there is no parallel french wine is the pinnancle of viticulture perfection in a bottle
1204647 it must be great to get away from the fishbowl existence that you suffered in australia
1204648 exactly now there has been much conjecture about your salary could you clear things up for the interested public
1204649 well reports have been falsified the facts are i am making 1 million euros per year plus an unlimited supply of baguette coupons and a store discount for all felt beret outlets in toulon also included in my deal was a personal tailor felix who designs me the most current and cutting edge horizontally striped skivvies
1204650 yes i did notice the rather dashing fashion sense is this something that partly inspired this
1204651 i would prefer it if you didnt refer to this contract like it is some sort of
1204652 so tell me is khoder nasser your manager reports have said
1204653 we are friends i fell comfortable around him he is a calming influence on me he also bears a striking resemblance to john hopoate which i also enjoy and this relaxes me in case the paparazzi starts hounding me because he could always be relied on to perform similar forms of contrary conduct that hoppa was famous for he told me he would do that for me because hes my mate
1204654 yikes so will you ever come back to the nrl if they will have you that is
1204655 i love league i grew up playing it as a young poly boy so it will always be in my heart it is silly to rule out anything really acting rapping television journalism law medicine im just keeping my options open i guess
1204656 so do you aspire to be an all black is this what this is all about perhaps the new brad thorn
1204657 well ill point out that brad thorn is very unattractive whereas i am exceptionally good looking in fact i once had a well publicised tryst with candice falzon have you heard of her
1204658 ok some may argue that the 5 year deal from the bulldogs was very generous and that you doing a runner from the club let down the current players the already signed future players who are themselves victims of disrespect is this a fair assessment
1204659 come on sportingmind if that is even your real name who do you think you are peter fitzsimons only he has the
1204660 please dont be condescending by calling me sonny in a fatherly tone refer to me in the acronymic form sbw
1204661 but you were just lecturing me about referring to myself in the 3rd person in my columns
1204662 ok sbw i apologise tell me have you contacted the buldogs yet to explain your decision to leave abruptly on the eve of a game
1204663 that seems fair so do you see a proverbial avalanche of players from the nrl following you into the french rugby union competition there has been quite a moral panic back home about this issue
1204664 i dont think so pausing to sip from his glass heartily there is good money to be made but the nrl is a good competition it is a great product as you have probably heard about ad nauseum lately but its just not what i want at this stage in my life i want security i want to set my family up for life i have dreams of being an all black
1204665 im sure many would love to see you make that dream a reality sbw just one last question and well move onto the degustation menu i was just wondering what is your work out program your so chiselled not that im perving but wow sorry i have a tendency to blurt
1204666 thats ok it happens no secrets just hard work and good genes i guess sorry to disappoint you

1204668 my diagnosis was recently changed from chronic daily headache to migraine without aura i was surprised by the deep spiritual impact of this shift in understanding of my disease the good news is that the headache neurologist offered me hope something i needed desperately this post is about the importance of that hope for all of us

1204670 a nasa spokeswoman declined to characterize perchlorate as detrimental to life but perchlorate an oxidizing substance is known to be harmful to humans under certain circumstances and its existence in the soil could suggest that mars is less hospitable to life than the scientists have so far believed
1204671 but what if both tega and meca are right and perchlorates are found in some soil samples and not others thats what another new scientist colleague started to wonder after reading the nasa news release

1204675 it is ironic that anti racists are willing to challenge the jewish establishments view of the holocaust but not the issue of jewish world domination
1204676 it is not a myth which sustains the jewish state it is jewish global power it is power which sustains myths
1204677 but these are not subsidies they are tribute payments that the vanquished pay to their conquerors
1204678 it has become absurd to believe that the jos is an american colony on the contrary america now resembles a jewish colony america is not merely ruled by a jewish elite it has become the biggest prize in the global jewish empire
1204679 the subservience of our congressional and white house puppets to israeli military policy has been consistent theyre almost all puppets there are two sets congressional puppets and white house puppets when the chief puppeteer sharon comes to washington the puppets prance
1204680 it is an old canard that jews control america and american foreign policy
1204681 during both world wars anti semites said that jews manipulated america into war
1204682 iran is also threatening the moral and ideological base of israel the holocaust myth
1204683 if world opinion came to believe as an increasing number of historians claim that the holocaust was nothing but a propaganda lie designed pre dominantly for the purpose of mounting support for the creation of a jewish state in palestine it would become impossible for the us government to continue pumping billions of dollars in military and financial aid into its de facto colony israel and backup israels brutal oppression of the palestinian people through the ruthless abuse of its veto right in the un security council
1204684 the jewish state wouldnt even exist if it werent for the combined effort of the zionist lobby us government and stalin of making the world believe in the holocaust
1204685 attempt to portray the us israel relationship as mirroring that of washingtons relations to its client regimes in el salvador guatemala and nicaragua has no basis in reality
1204686 also there were no salvadoran nicaraguan or guatemalan lobbies of any consequence in washington to lavish millions of dollars wooing or intimidating members of congress no one in the house or senate from any of those client countries with possible dual loyalties approving multi billion dollar appropriations on an annual basis none owning major television networks radio stations newspapers or movie studios and no trade unions or state pension funds investing billions of dollars in their respective economies the closest thing in the category of national lobbies is that of miamis cuban exiles whose existence and power the left is willing to acknowledge even though its political clout is miniscule compared to that of israels supporters
1204687 the decision to give 2 2 billion in emergency military aid during the october war triggered an opec oil embargo that inflicted considerable damage on western economies
1204688 since the october war in 1973 washington has provided israel with a level of support dwarfing that given to any other state it has been the largest annual recipient of direct economic and military assistance since 1976 and is the largest recipient in total since world war two to the tune of well over 140 billion in 2004 dollars
1204689 when a parasite invades it hides as long as it can sucking the vital juices and draining the energy of its host
1204690 the u s was not merely adopting israels long established methods of initiative offence and pre emption it was also adopting israels adversaries as its own
1204691 aipac helps pass more than 100 pro israel legislative initiatives a year through more than 2 000 meetings with members of the u s congress according to aipac statistics
1204692 aipacs influence was underscored by the seeming multitude of government leaders in attendance at the conference the biggest in its 52 year history this year half the senate a quarter of the house and many white house administration officials including vice president dick cheney participated
1204693 if there are truly elites who are pulling the strings in washington and control tel aviv as we are often told there will be no attack because those elites would certainly be aware of the consequences it will have for the free market capitalist system that they cherish if there is an attack it will be yet another proof that washington is israels most important occupied territory despite the efforts of a handful of brave individuals there to expose and bring a halt to the israelization of us middle east policy i dont like the concept of elites but i do not think there will be an attack and that the drum beats are designed to scare iran because there are no other realistic options available nevertheless beware the ides of march
1204694 if the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind

1204697 the public continues to be extremely downbeat about the national economy the pew center reports with just 10 percent calling the economy in good shape and 72 percent saying the economy is either in a recession 54 percent or depression 18
1204698 while rising costs are clearly the top economic problem in the publics view it is far from their only concern pew notes with more than seven in ten calling good jobs hard to find compared with 55 percent a little over a year ago
1204699 multiple economic concerns are taking a toll on public optimism pew adds
1204700 about half of americans 51 percent expect their personal financial situation to improve over the next year down from 55 percent in march and 60 percent in january
1204701 we all know his story his service to his country the price he paid ive seen him stand up to the whole senate

1204714 they say they think the babys get onto the bed and then go outside the window to the fire escape thats how she fall out
1204715 when we saw the baby crying and we see no blood we said at least the babys alive
1204716 they said she have a ball of blood on the head and its leaking
1204717 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
1204718 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1204719 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
1204720 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1204721 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
1204722 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
1204723 yes consumer price increases are so high that the inflation hawks will be screeching like crazy at tomorrows fomc meeting expect some strong language about inflation in the statement but no action
1204724 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1204725 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1204726 born a year after the russian revolution for the very long years of soviet terror he incarnated dissidence
1204727 it was alexander solzhenitsyn who opened the eyes of the world to the reality of the soviet system giving a universal reach to his experience
1204728 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky
1204729 he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1204730 will be remembered as an intellectual who provided us with a testimony tinged with suffering and a sharp and accurate view on the tragedies of 20th century totalitarianism
1204731 russia today lost a great fighter for truth who worked to reconcile the russians with their past the world loses a figure of freedom
1204732 one of the greatest european writers of the 20th century an author who contributed to changing the course of history
1204733 with his descriptions of the prison camps he opened the eyes of many on the left and forced them to reconsider communism
1204734 a central character in the tragic history of 20th century russia
1204735 on days like today we have a duty to remember him and his commitment to russia
1204736 solzhenitsyn was a great writer and a moral witness bringing the evils of the gulag to the attention of the world
1204737 his brave and arduous lifes journey which included surviving the gulag internal and external exile made him one of the 20th centurys most important voices in the struggle against the tyranny of totalitarian regimes
1204738 proved that we can without contradiction be patriotic and still face up to dark episodes of our history
1204739 for chinese intellectuals he was a master of literature and for others who suffered in the 1960s and 1970s he was a thinker with a deep sense of justice and morality who pitilessly attacked the crimes of the soviet dictatorship
1204740 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century an irreplaceable loss for russia and the whole world
1204741 he served the fatherland like a genuine citizen and patriot and he felt with his whole heart for the fate of the russian people for justice in the country
1204742 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think about past and present in a different way
1204743 i read his works with interest and admiration the same admiration i had for the courage he showed in his personal life

1204767 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1204768 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1204769 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1204770 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding

1205046 we are extremely pleased with the data emerging from our proprietary 5 ht6 antagonist program mem 68626 produces a robust effect in key models of cognition with a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile providing a strong rationale for clinical development in a cognition indication
1205047 we look forward to advancing this program into the clinic by year end
1205048 characterization of serotonin 5 ht6 receptor antagonists as putative drugs for age related mild cognitive impairment and alzheimers disease
1205049 we are encouraged that in this study we saw increased amyloid beta which is thought to be bound to ly2062430 in both the blood and cerebrospinal fluid we hypothesize that this effect may lead to reduced formation of amyloid plaques in the brain after long term treatment
1205050 alzheimers disease is complex and theres a real need for new treatments that might be shown ultimately to slow disease progression in addition to the biomarker results we are particularly encouraged by the finding that patients who received the monoclonal antibody treatment over 12 weeks appeared to have no treatment related side effects
1205051 results from this phase ii study are promising and we are pleased to announce our intention to commence a phase iii pivotal study of ly2062430 beginning in 2009
1205052 additionally we are currently enrolling patients into the phase iii study called identity which examines treatment with ly450139 an investigational gamma secretase inhibitor believed to slow the rate of formation of amyloid beta potentially slowing disease progression these two neuroscience pipeline candidates represent potentially important advances in the effort to slow the progression of this fatal disease and demonstrate our longstanding commitment to developing treatments for devastating brain illnesses
1205053 therapies targeting amyloid in alzheimers disease must continue to be thoroughly tested
1205054 at the same time we know that alzheimers is a complex disease and that better treatments and preventions will likely also be complex so we must investigate every promising drug target looking eventually towards the possibility of a multi strategy approach
1205055 people initially treated with placebo and then crossed over to dimebon did not show the same level of benefit as those people who took dimebon for the full 18 months
1205056 this emphasizes the benefit of earlier treatment and suggests the possibility that dimebon may slow of the progression of alzheimers however open label extensions are not that same as placebo controlled trials and extrapolation of the treatment results should be done with caution patients are being screened now for the phase iii clinical trials
1205057 dimebon appears to work through a mechanism of action that is distinct from currently marketed alzheimers drugs dimebon improves impaired mitochondrial function mitochondria are the central energy source of all cells and impaired mitochondrial function may play a significant role in the loss of brain cell function in alzheimers
1205058 while there were relatively small numbers of participants in this study we were nonetheless able to demonstrate that people with alzheimers who get uninterrupted treatment with ivig for nine months have statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements on both cognitive and global clinical measures
1205059 a large scale 18 month multicenter phase iii clinical trial of ivig in alzheimers is now getting underway sponsored by baxter and the national institutes of health that will test whether ivig immunotherapy provides long term benefits and has a disease modifying effect additional studies may be required
1205060 we saw an increase in amyloid beta which is thought to be bound to ly2062430 in both the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of study participants
1205061 additionally after treatment we found a correlation between beta amyloid in blood and the amount of amyloid plaque in brain as determined by impy imaging as well as an increase in blood and csf in certain types of beta amyloid found in plaques these biomarker data suggest that amyloid plaques in the brain may begin to dissolve after 12 weeks of treatment with this antibody were now planning a phase iii clinical trial of this drug to be started in 2009
1205062 in our study people with alzheimers who took antidementia drugs more persistently lived longer than those who took the medications for shorter time intervals
1205063 in an earlier study involving this group we reported that persistency of treatment was also associated with long term cognitive and functional benefits persistent drug therapy appears to help alzheimers patients live longer and the mechanism may be related to overall improvement of cognition and function resulting from current symptomatic therapies
1205064 18 month data from an open label extension of a one year controlled trial of dimebon in patient with mild to moderate alzheimers disease
1205065 effects of uninterrupted intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of alzheimers disease for 9 months
1205066 safety tolerability and biomarker effects of an abeta monoclonal antibody administered to patients with alzheimers disease
1205067 persistent antidementia drug treatment and survival in an alzheimers disease cohort
1205068 we may not be able to do anything about aging genetics or family history but research shows us that there are lifestyle decisions we all can make to keep our brains healthier as we age and that also may lower our risk of developing alzheimers disease
1205069 living in a couple relationship is normally one of the most intense forms of social and intellectual stimulation if social and cognitive challenges can protect against dementia so should living in a couple relation
1205070 this study points to the beneficial effects of a married life consistent with the general hypothesis of social stimulation as a protective factor against dementia
1205071 your personality traits specifically your psychological and cognitive style when confronting distress may be associated with your risk for dementia
1205072 however exactly how this works still needs to be determined
1205073 met s was independently associated with lower cognitive planning neuromotor and functional scores and with more depressive symptoms
1205074 the results from this study reinforce the importance of maintaining good physical health in order to reduce ones risk of experiencing cognitive decline and possibly developing alzheimers disease
1205075 cases of dementia in the general population can be best identified by a combination of socio demographic clinical and cognitive factors
1205076 developing a better understanding of the factors that increase risk for alzheimers will help us to create more effective methods to prevent people from developing the disease

1205179 we prepared the race last night considering that we knew that in these conditions the two effects were relevant

1205190 its to be seen how the dows india index is going to be accepted the sensex is synonymous with the stock markets even the nses nifty index could not challenge the position of the sensex
1205191 what the world needs is a trusted means of measuring this countrys development and an index that can be used by investors around the world to track the progress of indian companies and the indian economy we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend
1205192 the world is changing and how we measure that change economically and financially is clearly a challenge and an opportunity we have seen a reweighting of risk but the world itself is being economically rerated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes
1205193 as will companies from other emerging countries where we have seen an unprecedented economic emancipation over the past two decades
1205194 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognise the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india

1205437 upaya ini untuk mempertemukan warga miskin dengan tim dari kabupaten sleman sehingga apa yang diinginkan keluarga miskin dapat diketahui oleh tim dari kabupaten dengan demikian program yang nantinya dilaksanakan sesuai dengan kebutuhan masyarakat dan sesuai dengan potensi serta peluang yang ada di wilayah masing masing
1205438 pada tahun 2008 ini upaya penanggulangan kemiskinan di sleman telah menjadi prioritas pembangunan penanggulangan kemiskinan dan pengangguran serta peningkatan pemberdayaan masyarakat menjadi prioritas pembangunan di sleman

1205441 me doli mucho el haber salido afortunadamente despu s de cuatro a os y medio estamos de regreso y muy comprometidos
1205442 mi reto al llegar aqu a necaxa es primeramente estar de titular jugar y pelear por un puesto creo que vamos a tener un reto muy importante pero no imposible y ahora hay que trabajar para ponerme al nivel de mis compa eros y tratar de hacer un buen torneo
1205443 hemos tra do a dos nuevos elementos que han llegado a reforzar el equipo seguimos trabajando con el cuerpo t cnico el cuerpo t cnico nos ha pedido estos dos refuerzos los hemos tra do haciendo un gran esfuerzo y seguimos trabajando para traer otros dos jugadores m s

1205446 pumas est preparado para enfrentar a cualquier rival y nosotros enfrentamos a todos los equipos con la misma disposici n y dif cilmente nos relajamos
1205447 en esta ocasi n se venci al uno toluca y con el trabajo que hicimos los dejamos fuera hoy esperamos pasar encima de atlante para levantar una copa que nos tiene ilusionados
1205448 pumas saldr a ganar como sea obviamente jugando bien teniendo posesi n de la pelota terminando las jugadas y no dejar jugar al atlante as hay m s posibilidades de conseguirlo
1205449 a qui n no le hace falta un t tulo yo creo que a nadie le sale sobrando aquel que ya fue campe n tiene la misma ilusi n de no ser as ya no jugar amos futbol
1205450 creo que para estas dos finales vamos a tener buenos rbitros
1205451 conf o plenamente en los rbitros que nos piten porque creo que todos son honestos tal vez algunos no se presten al di logo y otros tienen personalidades diferentes creo que son honestos esperemos que no lleguen a equivocarse son humanos y hay que dejarlos que hagan su trabaj concluy

1205457 es un momento importante quiz el m s importante de mi carrera profesional aprovecharlo para poder cerrar este ciclo
1205458 son dos equipos que nos estamos jugando mucho merecidamente estamos en la final y no nos concentramos en un par de jugadores sino en un equipo
1205459 hemos mantenido a lo largo del torneo y que nos ha dado resultado esperemos podamos desplegar el d a de ma ana
1205460 hay que tener mucha concentraci n para evitar brindar espacios al rival porque sabemos que son letales m s a n ac en casa se hacen fuertes creo debemos tener la tranquilidad para estar bien concentrados los 90 minutos
1205461 para nada soy el salvador esto es un equipo una familia que se ha formado y ha conseguido los resultados en base a eso gracias a dios se van dando la cosas uno est muy contento y agradecido por el trato de los compa eros y el club estar en la final es muy importante
1205462 este ha sido un a o especial para m y este premio lo corona
1205463 la nica forma de ganar un premio como ste es pertenecer a un equipo competitivo tengo que agradecer a los jugadores y al t cnico
1205464 estamos ansiosos por mostrar lo que podemos hacer y de salir a hacer un gran partido seguir avanzando a semifinales que es el objetivo que nos planteamos ahora
1205465 en casa de ser posible tenemos que sacar una ventaja no va a ser f cil porque ellos diablos rojos tienen un buen equipo pero nosotros tenemos la obligaci n un poco porque ellos terminaron mejor el empate ser a mal resultado para nosotros y nos podr a dejar fuera
1205466 empezar jugando la liguilla como lo hicimos en los ltimos tres partidos y mejorar algunas cosas
1205467 la posesi n del bal n no replegarse cuando se va ganando porque la contundencia siempre es importante como la solidez defensiva todos son puntos que tiene que estar al cien por ciento para hacer un buen partido
1205468 es una realidad toluca lo es sin duda primero por el lugar en el que termin y segundo porque cerrar la eliminatoria en casa y le favorecer el empate al final
1205469 nosotros tenemos la responsabilidad mayor de ganar por la situaci n de la tabla
1205470 no lo veo as me parece una serie muy pareja y al final el que est m s concentrado deber avanzar creo que el partido de ma ana ser igual o m s dif cil que el que jugamos hace una semana all y encontraremos al mejor toluca
1205471 tenemos gente importante y capaz que lo ha venido haciendo bien durante el torneo se hicieron varios cambios porque hay varios jugadores que estamos parejos as que el t cnico puede contar con cualquiera de nosotros para estar en la cancha
1205472 les gustaria que se unan la conmebol y la concacaf para que formen una federacion americana de futbol
1205473 porque ya nos hemos equivocado y no queremos equivocarnos otra vez y aplicaremos toda la prudencia y la tranquilidad del mundo
1205474 esperamos que en diciembre el jugador y el club podamos encontrar una soluci n a esto y que sea digna para todos
1205475 creo que es el momento de que rom n acabe y finalice con el villarreal y que ser a lo mejor para todos pero si no es as l seguir con nosotros cobrando
1205476 en estos momentos es pronto para decir que en diciembre las cosas se van a solucionar es m s en estos momentos no tenemos ninguna oferta por el jugador
1205477 fue un partido igualado de principio que solucion rom n con dos grandes goles
1205478 sinceramente creo que rom n no tiene que demostrarle nada a nadie todos sabemos lo gran futbolista y jugador que es nunca he tenido ninguna duda de ello
1205479 tenemos enfrente varios partidos de preparaci n de cara al preol mpico y poco a poco vamos logrando el perfil deseado
1205480 hurrying to kill this wanton tyrant king abdullah who has announced himself to be a leader of atheism would be among the most pious acts
1205481 the call for a rapprochement of religions issued by the saudi tyrant is an integral part of the overt crusader war against islam and muslims
1205482 this in fact is a call to turn ones back on islam and to look for commonalities with judaism and christianity so whatever the three agree on would become the new modern religion which would be allowed to be propagated
1205483 there is a possibility that repeated questions on matters such as the reasons why crown princess masako is not accompanying the crown prince on overseas visits will aggravate her medical condition
1205484 this is about joy and celebration and pride in being tongan
1205485 the other countries in the pacific that have lost their royal families they regret it now
1205486 me disculpo ante portugal y ante los portugueses porque aqu me siento en casa
1205487 fue una situaci n de mucha confusi n y s lo quise proteger a mis atletas

1205489 por eso cuando reaccion comet un error pero a veces hasta las personas racionales y normales se equivocan por eso quisiera disculparme con ustedes con los hinchas y con el pueblo de portugal
1205490 el t cnico influye mucho en cuanto a irradiar seguridad y confianza y a ellos siempre les he irradiado eso por eso est n en la selecci n nacional y ma ana buscaremos la calificaci n porque es nuestra intenci n y finalidad nos estamos capacitando para ello
1205491 estos d as son importantes para recuperar esas molestias musculares esos golpes y situaciones de estar adoloridos por el estado de terreno de juego de nueva york pero ya para ma ana estaremos pensando en el juego contra panam en este partido donde el tri buscar su calificaci n a cuartos de final de la copa oro 2007 podr a incluir al lateral izquierdo fausto pinto del pachuca quien como sus otros dos compa eros jaime correa y juan carlos cacho se integraron al grupo desde el s bado aunque s lo el est registrado para jugar los cambios son por cosas obvias porque en el partido del viernes junto con el del domingo fueron en menos de 48 horas hay que pensar en forma coherente que los jugadores no son m quinas sino seres humanos y que hay que distribuir el esfuerzo expuso tras la pr ctica en las instalaciones de los crusaders fighters de la universidad jesuita de esta ciudad indic ahora contra panam tuvimos un d a m s de descanso por as llamarlo se han recuperado todos los jugadores y jugar n los m s convenientes para afrontar este compromiso el entrenador del tricolor por ahora no piensa en viajar a boston posibilidad que se dar a si m xico termina en el tercer sitio del grupo c lo que obligar a al equipo nacional a viajar all jueves o viernes para jugar el s bado ante el l der del grupo b que seguro ser estados unidos ahora mismo estamos pensando en el juego contra panam despu s pensaremos en hacer la planeaci n m s conveniente lo que queremos es calificar lo que ha sido desgastante ha sido la cancha y no los viajes manifest aunque la meta es seguir en houston toda la semana apunt a los viajes estamos acostumbrados a lo que no es a una cancha como en la que jugamos en nueva york lo importante es calificar da igual si es primero segundo o tercero y ya contra el que juguemos nos ocuparemos cuando sepamos contra quien nos toque respecto a su rival de ma ana por la noche mencion es un equipo que indudablemente va a buscar la calificaci n est n en juego los puntos buscaremos imponer nuestro estilo y sabemos que ellos son jugadores de una estatura importante y que buscan sacar provecho de ello el partido va a ser dif cil pero entretenido a ver qui n impone su estilo volvi a quejarse de la cancha del estadio de los gigantes en nueva york todas las canchas del mundo tienen que estar en las mejores condiciones pero la de nueva york era como para jugar rugby o futbol americano cuando ya ha sostenido dos pr cticas en la universidad jesuita en sus planes est trabajar hoy por la noche en el estadio reliant aunque es muy posible que no pueda hacerlo nos est n amenazando por decirlo de alguna manera de no poder entrenar en la cancha como es el reglamento necesitamos una hora previo al partido y el d a anterior tiene que ser obligado por el reglamento de fifa y me sorprendi much simo que no nos dejen pisarla y eso perjudica no s lo a nosotros sino a los cuatro equipos que van a jugar ah agreg son simplemente decisiones que toman y se permitir pisar la cancha pero no puedes entrenar y qu sacas una metralleta
1205492 igual entrenar sirve para mentalizarnos de c mo est el terreno de juego el hecho de verlo nos va a ayudar much simo porque si es un pantano como el del otro d a

1205518 older people may need less sleep or they may sleep less because of age related changes in the ability to fall asleep and remain asleep
1205519 younger people frequently do not get as much sleep as they need and there are many health and safety problems associated with too little sleep
1205520 if older people believe that they need more sleep than they can achieve even when they spend extra time in bed then they may complain of insomnia and could start taking medications needlessly
1205521 older people may need to be evaluated for a sleep disorder if they are tired during the day
1205522 the surprise in this paper is that p110beta has been found to be a bigger player than p110alpha in tumors that result from pten loss
1205523 now the drug companies which have been focusing on p110alpha will have to think about making p110beta inhibitors as well
1205524 we knew that when cells are stimulated with growth factor signals the activity of p110alpha but not p110beta rises rapidly and sharply in triggering excess cell growth
1205525 we speculate that 110beta may be providing a low level but steady growth stimulus and when pten is lost it becomes an important source of cell proliferation signals
1205526 we know what the inhibitor should look like because of our work on p110alpha inhibitors

1205553 the american patriot wears many hats and changes clothes often the extraordinary leaders and great thinkers who helped mold the republic are not only the figures traditionally highlighted in history textbooks equally patriotic were those americans who fought against the status quo who agitated for economic and social reform who championed the rights of those whose rights had not yet been acknowledged and whose ideas were new and revolutionary in their own times

1205621 so i tell myself tell myself its wrong theres a point we pass from which we cant return
1205622 all because of you i havent slept in so long when i do i dream of drowning in the ocean
1205623 life is a waterfall were one in the river and one again after the fall swimming through the void we hear the word we lose ourselves but we find it all

1205640 can we be saved has the damage all been done is it too late to reverse what weve become a lesson to learn at a crucial point in time whats mine was always yours and yours is mine
1205641 and so we carry on each day as if our lifes are not so grey while every breath that we take we only suffocate brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed on wall street a single mom of three a tv personality
1205642 youre running circles around my slow pace youve reached the finish line only to realize there was no race

1205877 i contrast this to the recent rumors that the secrecy over obamas birth certificate is not some nefarious secret like he isnt a us citizen but something far more ordinary that his parents probably never married in the first place i said this in private emails to a few bloggers several weeks ago to me it isnt something that is anyones business but what does bother me is the dreamy fantasy promulgated in his books a fairy tale romance that he is able to spin out over years and continents trying to craft a respectable ending for the familys honor if not exactly for the individuals involved the truth ironically enough is more interesting reflecting a tough minded independent and determined woman with dreams of her own who may not have been the person her son wanted her to be
1205878 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1205879 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1205880 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive
1205881 once confidence is shaken and markets become fragile it does take a reasonable period of time for markets to recover from that

1205889 62 percent of students between 12 and 15 know someone who has been in an abusive relationship
1205890 lets say you read a statistic from a study that says 75 percent of students at harvard say they know someone who has cheated on a test what does that mean does that mean that three quarters of harvard students are cheaters many people will read it that way but they are wrong in an extreme hypothetical explanation for how wrong this could be its possible that only one student at harvard cheated but everyone knew about him
1205891 generation y has embraced sincere interaction with the rest of the world because our goal is to change society through our own self improvement and involvement

1205917 institutions for use and management of resources that are or could be enjoyed collectively many will refer to such resources and their systems of usage as commons thus a commons may be a part of the natural world used by humans or it may be a social reality created by humans such as the internet or an urban space
1205918 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1205919 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1205920 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1205921 we are going to take advantage of both centralized and distributed approaches where it makes sense

1205929 i was in the section of the building that did not collapse with five other friends we felt the flames coming up from the ground floor
1205930 we woke up for the pre dawn prayer some of our friends went for a wash and a great explosion occurred there
1205931 never in my life have i seen the arrest of blackboards encircled by a police tape some of which were still chalked with group theory problems
1205932 the concrete quality of the building is so bad that anything we touch falls to pieces
1205933 mr obamas years at the law school are also another chapter in which he seemed as intently focused on his own political rise as on the institution itself
1205934 embarking on five political races during his 12 years at the school
1205935 mr obama in turn could play the star in what even some fans saw as self absorption mr obamas hypothetical cases occasionally featured himself take barack obama theres a good looking guy he would introduce a twisty legal case
1205936 mr obamas courses chronicled the failure of liberal policies and court led efforts at social change the reconstruction era amendments that were rendered meaningless by a century of resistance the way the triumph of brown gave way to fights over busing the voting rights laws that crowded blacks into as few districts as possible he was wary of noble theories students say instead they call mr obama a contextualist willing to look past legal niceties to get results
1205937 nor could his views be gleaned from scholarship mr obama has never published any
1205938 he was unwilling to put his name to anything that could haunt him politically
1205939 all of which may explain why as disturbed as i might have been by ronald reagans election in 1980 i understood his appeal reagan spoke to americas longing for order our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies so long as we rediscover the traditional virtues of hard work patriotism personal responsibility optimism and faith
1205940 were tinged with nihilism during his undergraduate years 1979 81 at occidental college outside los angeles there he played it cool and detached and began to confuse partying and getting high with rebellion
1205941 the last thing that barack obama will have to worry about next year when he graduates is job offers obama finished his second year at harvard law school this spring and has been elected to lead the harvard law review a prestigious position traditionally reserved for a top student
1205942 its a great time to be a young black law school graduate if youre from harvard and in the top quarter of your class said obama
1205943 obama uses his ethnicity as a kind of unspoken metaphor for his political approach here is a man the message is intended to convey who is white and black liberal and conservative foreign and american a man above party ideology and the petty bickering of partisan politics
1205944 i was never lacking in confidence that my particular background would not be a barrier to me running
1205945 im not sure if this is a new lesson but it reinforced my belief that were not as divided as our politics would indicate americans are not particularly ideological everybody is sort of a mix of what you might consider some liberal ideas what you might consider some conservative ideas but there is a set of common values that everybody buys into everybody thinks you should have to work hard for what you get everybody believes that things like equal opportunity should be real not just a slogan
1205946 can you describe what change is what does it look like
1205947 i want people to feel connected to their government again
1205948 and i want that government to respond to the voices of the people and not just insiders and special interests thats real change i want us to think about the long term and not just the short term whether its climate change energy policy how were educating our kids what kind of investments were making in our infrastructure how were dealing with the federal budget and national debt
1205949 lies just one spot below the worlds top 200 forbes list of the worlds billionaires this is higher than such household names as donald trump sir richard branson and steven spielberg
1205950 i am shocked at the news of repayments being frozen especially given that senior managers of hanover have recently been advising me that the company was coping well with the difficult trading conditions
1205951 during his time at merrill lynch his base salary would have been more than us250 000 nz336 138 topped up by a bonus of cash shares and options on shares
1205952 the result did not merit going on strike when one takes into account the high rate of inflation there will not be much left over
1205953 the rapid agreement is the most favourable for all those involved
1205954 i have come to know frank bsirske as someone who has actively intervened on behalf of his members he was always prepared to set aside his own personal interests
1205955 in the hope of restoring some dignity to the debate to validate nudity and childhood as subjects for art to surrender to the power of the imagination in children and adults and dialogue without crippling them through fear mongering and repression
1205956 i have very deep strong personal views on this which is that we should be on about maximising the protection of children
1205957 i dont think this is a step in the right direction at all frankly i cant stand this stuff
1205958 a cheap sick stunt at the expense of a young child
1205959 its interesting that if the prime minister comments on say the greenhouse effect he gets expert advice first i would like to know which art expert advised him on this
1205960 im really really offended by what kevin rudd had to say about this picture
1205961 the overall tone of publication and the debate contained therein is considered to be serious and have genuine artistic content
1205962 this is not just for bill henson all artists are affected by potential threats of censorship and public hysteria
1205963 set of protocols to address the depiction of children in works exhibitions and publications that are recipients of government funding
1205964 the temperature of the general public is so hot at the moment with all of these various scares and pedophilic assassinations
1205965 it is important to not only use the existing fleet of ice breakers but also to build new ships and the first nuclear ice breaker of a new generation will be built by 2015 this should be an ice breaker capable of moving in rivers and seas
1205966 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
1205967 this dispute is not only about oil reserves which might or might not exist it is about the control of sea lanes russias movements could pitch it into a serious territorial dispute with the us for the first time
1205968 four of the five arctic powers are nato members yet nato seems ill configured to be able to respond to the sort of activities we have seen from the russians we need to ensure nato has the will and the capability to deter russian activity that contravenes international laws or treaties
1205969 the intransigence of great britain has not permitted that open and frank dialogue
1205970 in 1990 all oil production was stopped in east germany as it was not profitable
1205971 now with prices increasing six fold the boom is so big that there is a shortage of oil experts exploration teams are booked out for many months in advance and drilling equipment is totally unavailable for purchase on the market
1205972 they roskilde bank have seen some heavy losses on their lending to property developers there is a tense atmosphere here in denmark
1205973 we saw this first in the us then in the uk and spain and now also in denmark
1205974 it would have been much smarter not to have such a large real estate portfolio but we werent able to reduce its size fast enough
1205975 deferred payments inflated housing prices and now peoples vulnerability to unemployment is greater homeowners no longer have the option of deferring their payments
1205976 the approach may have been against the law but it worked the development is socially more robust today the residents generally have a higher level of income and the apartments are all occupied
1205977 there is a very large group who could be active in the labour market but who receive transfer incomes because they are ill or on early retirement or who receive other welfare benefits
1205978 social politics in denmark has always helped those who have been sick and unable to work with the 300 hours rule we are doing the opposite and pulling the economic security net from beneath them

1205983 they say they think the babys get onto the bed and then go outside the window to the fire escape thats how she fall out
1205984 when we saw the baby crying and we see no blood we said at least the babys alive

1205990 surenos 13 an ms 13 offshoot with a primarily salvadoran membership this six foot high tag hasnt been disturbed which given that surenos 13 has been very busy in the manassas area might indicate that surenos 13 is now the largest and most significant local gang
1205991 if you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival there may even be a worse case you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory because it is better to perish than to live as slaves
1205992 the study found that 25 to 50 percent of gang members in northern virginia and western parts of the state are believed to be deportable immigrants vaughan said that because data varied by jurisdictions the finding was based mostly on interviews with law enforcement agencies with rockingham county officials giving the lower estimate and fairfax county officials the higher one
1205993 among the studys other findings was that immigration enforcement officers have arrested more members of the gang mara salvatrucha or ms 13 in virginia than in any other ice jurisdiction of the 341 gang members arrested by ice in the state between february 2005 and september 2007 almost 80 percent were members of ms 13 the study found gang investigators estimate that 90 percent of the members of that gang are illegal immigrants the study said

1206005 dispensational premillennialism has had unfortunate consequences on the christian mind
1206006 the fact remains that dr schaeffers manifesto offers no prescriptions for a christian society the same comment applies to all of dr schaeffers writings he does not spell out the christian alternative he knows that you cant fight something with nothing but as a premillennialist he does not expect to win the fight prior to the visible bodily return of jesus christ to earth to establish his millennial kingdom
1206007 do you realize if we start feeding hungry people things wont get worse and if things dont get worse jesus wont come

1206013 no additional announcement has been made about this aspect of the charging
1206014 all san franciscos sanctuary ordinance has done is bring violence and death to this once great city
1206015 because san franciscos political leaders have already demonstrated their willingness to act in flagrant violation of federal law i do not believe that local judicial institutions can be trusted to fairly try the case or mete out an appropriate punishment
1206016 we need to remember always that a death dealing policy like sanctuary hides behind the false mantle of compassion
1206017 still supports the worthwhile aims of denying the federal government
1206018 para los juegos de barcelona 92 no estaba unificado el ciclismo en argentina para poder correr carreras de pista tuve que sacar una licencia profesional para competir en europa con mi hermano gabriel y as ganar unos pesos fue una decisi n dif cil que tom porque nos estaba yendo mal a nivel recursos en lo que es deporte amateur por eso no pude ir a los juegos

1206031 to give voters the information they need in order to make informed decisions about how they might vote

1206039 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
1206040 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female a 5and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh b 6so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
1206041 do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman it is an abomination
1206042 if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman both of them have done what is detestable they must be put to death their blood will be on their own heads

1206049 hindrafs genuine supporters should be aware there are many who pretend to be our loyal supporters but in fact are agent provocateurs planted by parties interested in destroying and dismantling hindrafs struggle for the indian community
1206050 these are not necessarily police officers but informers who are on the payroll of the special branch in due course we will reveal these personnel with evidence
1206051 many see hindraf as an opportunity to gain leverage and dictate their own benefits this is totally against our principles hindraf is you and me who are battling a war for better policies and governance for the malaysian indian as a society with equal and fair treatment as opposed to individual glamour and glory

1206067 the main cause for the chaos we see in muslim countries is the external factor the western interference in the 19th century they exploited and made muslims backward
1206068 western countries chose to stay put even when we gained independence meddling in our economic and domestic affairs because they wanted to maintain their presence and exploit our natural resources
1206069 islam teaches its followers to live peacefully with non muslims so its a question of occupation by these powers not a question of islam and the jews

1206711 it really makes sense because of the way the landscape has been evolving

1206715 this study shows that immunotherapy is safe and well tolerated and could ultimately be beneficial for this high risk population

1206718 there are no black managers no black general managers no black owners
1206719 i truly believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be lets say a field manager or perhaps a general manager
1206720 why are black men or black people not good swimmers because they dont have the buoyancy
1206721 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them
1206722 for this reason it is important to determine which are helpful not only for shrinking tumors and extending survival but also for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life
1206723 in general younger more educated and more affluent cancer survivors were more likely to use complementary methods
1206724 people with more advanced cancer were more likely to be complementary method users
1206725 scientific studies of complementary methods have become much more common during the past few years but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of many complementary methods
1206726 as more studies are done to evaluate effectiveness we will want to know whether men are missing opportunities to use some effective complementary methods that are far more popular in women or whether women use ineffective complementary methods more than men or whether some complementary methods are more effective for women than they are for men
1206727 this study like many before it confirms that cancer patients actively pursue a variety of alternative and complementary therapies usually in conjunction with standard approaches to cancer treatment
1206728 it is not known but it is not thought that these have an impact on cancer related outcomes though many patients report deriving comfort solace or symptom relief with such practices
1206729 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
1206730 i believe hes a big kid or he wouldnt go around intimidating people who are just doing their job

1206735 citgo is a large corporation and it is all too rare in this world that large corporations have a responsibility to the community from which they garner their profits
1206736 he is committed to creating this constituency in the united states and also to embarrassing the united states
1206737 that here is this third world country that is really taking care of social problems in the united states that the united states is not able to deal with i think that is politically what ch vez tries to do
1206738 how they conduct themselves in the region and the nature of democracy internally and their relations with iran i think those things are going to weigh more heavily than the modest donations they have made to domestic groups
1206739 droom taught me to raise capital when we dont need it and to always be frugal in everything we do
1206740 they democratized the experience in the sense that they allowed consumers to say i can choose

1206752 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1206753 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1206754 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1206755 inflation is still an issue and certainly the first half of the year was a big burden on consumer spending
1206756 consumers appear to be acting rationally in a very uncertain economic environment
1206757 i think the industry should be very concerned anything that impacts the spending power of consumers clearly impacts our industry

1206799 this is bigger than kennedy this is the new testament
1206800 i felt this thrill going up my leg i mean i dont have that too often no seriously its a dramatic event
1206801 obama is creative imagination which coupled with brilliance equals wisdom he is the man for this time
1206802 obamas finest speeches do not excite they do not inform they dont even really inspire they elevate he is not the word made flesh but the triumph of word over flesh obama is at his best able to call us back to our highest selves
1206803 obama has the capacity to summon heroic forces from the spiritual depths of ordinary citizens and to unleash therefrom a symphonic chorus of unique creative acts whose common purpose is to tame the soul and alleviate the great challenges facing mankind
1206804 were here to evolve to a higher plane he is an evolved leader he has an ear for eloquence and a tongue dipped in the unvarnished truth
1206805 i would characterize the senate race as being a race where obama was lets say blessed and highly favored thats not routine theres something else going on i think that obama his election to the senate was divinely ordered i know that that was gods plan

1206826 us respect for international law might be further damaged by this execution
1206827 we are deeply disappointed with this recommendation from the board of pardons and paroles
1206828 the board has failed to support the united states in fulfilling its international legal obligations the boards action risks the safety of thousands of americans travelling and living abroad
1206829 the failure on the part of the us could have very serious implications for our relationship with mexico as well as other nations

1206832 we welcome any new research that could lead to the development of effective treatments for psychosis especially if those treatments bring fewer of the horrible side effects that are associated with some medications for schizophrenia
1206833 these findings are exciting but we cant jump the gun this is one small study and it needs to be followed up with further research before any of us can be really excited about it
1206834 a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine would give patients and doctors enormous advantages over current treatments both in developed and developing countries

1206836 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1206837 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1206838 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer
1206839 in the end the results were startling and we could use these viruses to induce very high levels of antibodies for the first time

1206846 louis armstrong is quite simply the most important person in american music he is to 20th century music i did not say jazz what einstein is to physics and the wright brothers are to travel
1206847 what he does is real and true and honest and simple and even noble every time this man puts his trumpet to his lips even if only to practice three notes he does it with his whole soul
1206848 if you have to ask what jazz is youll never know
1206849 i think that louis armstrong loosened the world helped people be able to say yeah
1206850 my whole life my whole soul my whole spirit is to blow that horn
1206851 hes the father of us all regardless of style or how modern we get his influence is inescapable some of the things he was doing in the 20s and 30s people still havent dealt with
1206852 you cant play anything on a horn that louis hasnt played
1206853 there is two kinds of music the good and the bad i play the good kind
1206854 if you dont like louis armstrong you dont know how to love
1206855 the memory of things gone is important to a jazz musician
1206856 louis armstrong is the master of the jazz solo he became the beacon the light in the tower that helped the rest of us navigate the tricky waters of jazz improvisation

1206864 if he does testify no matter what he says the prosecutor will charge him with perjury hes made that pretty clear to us
1206865 if he does not testify he can be charged with contempt and that was the road that my father chose one that was more principled i think in terms of his taking a stand against the governments abuse of power
1206866 if they can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset
1206867 i am not going to put off dr grand jury appearance to assist in what is becoming the islamisation of america
1206868 hes been singled out because hes been an effective courageous man
1206869 this all stems from aipac the american israel public affairs committee
1206870 this guy is just speaking out very effectively for the palestinian cause thats what is the root of this and the government is trying to stifle that
1206871 i believe that the defence is on firm ground saying that this is a case of political persecution
1206872 in fact i am hard pressed to find another case just like it
1206873 the prosecutions conduct is typical of the bush administration in that it will not accept defeat whether from a jury or a judge
1206874 when they fail to get the relief they seek they simply connive another way to secure it

1206915 it is unlikely that will happen today but we think looking forward a relaxation of rates may well be warranted for australian businesses and consumers
1206916 we think to date that the rba has acted appropriately in heading off inflationary expectations
1206917 however since the reserve bank lifted rates in march this year a number of major international factors have influenced the slowdown in economic demand
1206918 this has all had the impact of markedly slowing demand in the australian economy
1206919 we dont believe that a rate reduction of something like 0 25 per cent is immediately going to make the economy boil over we just think it is an appropriate time for the rba to now consider a reduction
1206920 its a question of balance for the rba and thats what they are trying to do
1206921 they are trying to balance out the stimulatory impact of our higher national income caused by high commodity prices and improving terms of trade against lower domestic demand hitting the retail sector hitting building construction and housing
1206922 thats significantly pushed the us dollar higher and hurt the aussie and the kiwi us dollars and other currencies
1206923 the selling pressure on the australian dollar has come from the fact weve had a fall in commodity prices and weve seen a rebound in the us dollar

1206930 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1206931 im so pumped i dont even know what to say
1206932 everyone was getting me really pumped up because i really wanted to win and im stoked i just tried to keep myself cool and composed the whole time i was just trying to keep it in rhythm and keep going
1206933 i was giving it everything i had and we surfed so many heats today
1206934 tim boal did an awesome job and im just stoked with the win
1206935 im super stoked to be the new wqs no 1
1206936 its tough because there are so many good guys im just trying to focus on each heat and take it one contest at a time i think all of the training and staying focused is paying off
1206937 im happy with the points but i would have liked to come away with the win
1206938 this is my second u s open win and it feels a lot better the second time around
1206939 the waves are alright for being as windy as it is in huntington and its just fun to go out and surf with some friends
1206940 my goal was to go out and put two decent scores on the board right off the bat
1206941 i just tried to improve throughout the final and was lucky enough to be able to
1206942 i knew it was going to take everything i had and i tried my hardest and fortunately the cards went my way all of the boys were surfing insane all week and theyre some of my favorite surfers so i was just stoked to be in the heat

1206947 but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
1206948 often times in this world sin is defined in a most superficial way relating more to ones cultural frame of reference than the mind of christ
1206949 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1206950 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain

1207000 politicians seem to do whatever they please when they have a problem they go to property owners for a tax increase clearly they do not hear the taxpayers cries for lower taxes their inability shows they cannot manage money and should be voted out of office
1207001 highly coloured sentimentality is a more comforting response to death than acceptance of the stark facts and it was easier to mourn the demise of the princess of wales than contemplate the life of mother teresa which might have caused us to examine our consciences

1207084 i have had a passion for collage since i was a kid i cut up words and magazines for comfort and the tradition lasted as i got older i turned to sketchbooks and journals as early as third grade for that morsel for expression that magically seems to balance things again i dont know why cutting things apart to reassemble them has made the world right side up for me but at times it has literally done just that i have a little training in fine arts most of what i create now has been a necessary process of exploration in mixed media and art journaling over the years that developed mainly out of creative isolation having to figure out new materials sizes and techniques is a wonderful way to develop your own style after many years of keeping art journals my mother and i decided to launch an arts business in the stationery industry translating original artwork into digital renderings for greeting cards it has been an incredibly wonderful way for me to express myself as an artist a great bridge for me between my creative life and my mundane life i have been able to remain creatively free and self directed using the same formulas that kept me company years ago on the couch with only a journal a cup of tea and some paint to overcome a stressful day overtime i have fallen in love with digital arts and see it as a the ultimate tool today much of what i create at papaya is digital or a combination i love this balance when i burn out with digital artwork i play with my hand work and vice versa to me the beauty of so much of the mixed media and journal arts movement is the personal quality of it i try very hard to create artwork for myself and nothing more and when i succeed in getting out of my own way i share it with the rest of the world thats my formula

1207096 prince harrys presence in afghanistan encourages our fighters to launch more attacks on british forces we think prince harry has been sent to afghanistan only to boost the sagging morale of the british forces which are in serious trouble for us he is just part of occupation forces instead of killing innocent people the prince should try to influence the british government to withdraw troops from afghanistan

1207105 no hemos consolidado a plenitud los esquemas de transparencia y rendici n de cuentas en todos los componentes del sector educativo
1207106 me parece que ella ha tra do siempre el di logo y el acuerdo en t rminos institucionales y respetuosos cualquier acuerdo que se construya en el marco institucional legal de cara a los ciudadanos debe ser un acuerdo que promueva como es en su caso calidad y equidad
1207107 creo que en la medida que avancemos en este proceso podremos no solamente dentro de las instituciones sino en toda la agenda educativa rendir mejores cuentas sobre todo del uso del dinero de los ciudadanos
1207108 es el primer paso de una agenda a la que regresa el m rito de la transparencia y el esfuerzo
1207109 es un proceso que debe perfeccionarse y no debe dar marcha atr s garantiza que el m rito regrese a las aulas y que sea el nico par metro para que los maestros puedan obtener su ascenso

1207123 may be slanted by the needs of the department of defense
1207124 you rely on a justice department opinion as part of a programme then you will be subject to criminal investigation when as and if the tenure of the person who wrote the position changes or indeed the political winds change
1207125 the men he trained will not rest until they avenge him and realize his aspirations and hopes

1207133 why do i need a blog for my internet business anyway
1207134 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1207135 i will protest the sword if its not wielded well
1207136 f7 detectives endure the protests of edward everett horton while the crumps are inside destroying his store they are barely recognizable in the general release version so that leads me to believe that one of the missing roadshow scenes centers on horton norton amp chandler
1207137 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1207138 the nation will have to decide as to which kind of islam it wants the world says that pakistan is extremist we will have to prove that we are not so when i say this im dubbed as an american stooge
1207139 we have to decide whether we want a liberal and moderate pakistan or a terrorist or extremist pakistan
1207140 i am encountering cases of people being repossessed as a result of deeply foolish loans and the bank and the taxpayer who now own northern rock are having to absorb the resulting losses
1207141 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1207142 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1207143 americans remain deeply invested in the notion of the authentic self
1207144 people feel profoundly like theyre not living from who they really are their authentic self their deepest possibility in the world the result is a sense of near desperation
1207145 the unimpeded operation of ones true or core self in ones daily enterprise
1207146 people do the right thing because they see it as an expression of their authentic selfhood
1207147 the authentic human self is called to be much nobler than what you see on the streets
1207148 the philosophical question is do we invent this authentic self
1207149 whether there is a core self or not we certainly believe that there is
1207150 this is who i really am im myself at last
1207151 patients who recover from depression will say im back to myself again
1207152 you can make the case that people are sometimes able to be more authentic on medication than not
1207153 eighty percent of the time people say some variation of im here to find my true self to come home to my true self
1207154 but in the long run accuracy is almost always better than bias
1207155 opening oneself up to an intimate makes one vulnerable to rejection or betrayal
1207156 oftentimes the very first line of defense you get with the folks who say im leading an inauthentic life is that theyre living life according to a fixed set of views and beliefs about how they should be
1207157 jung says the first thing you should do is take a look at those things that are dark in you the things that are problematical that you dont like
1207158 you have to be willing to look at things that dont fit snugly into the image you have of what you would like to be
1207159 we are all very subtle and very complex and there are forces and resources within us that we have no control over we will never find the limits of who we are
1207160 people carry around a heavy burden of not feeling authentic
1207161 because they have failed marriages and their work life hasnt gone the way it should and theyve disappointed everybody including themselves when people think of these as just failures as opposed to learning experiences they dont have to feel the weight of their lives or the choices theyve made that disowning creates a division that becomes the sense of inauthenticity
1207162 discern your own highly idiosyncratic gifts and your own highly idiosyncratic calling
1207163 real fulfillment comes from authentically grappling with the possibility inside you in a disciplined concentrated focused way
1207164 in the next life i shall not be asked why were you not more like moses
1207165 i shall be asked why were you not more like zusya
1207166 they can reinterpret reject or accept information based on their own coherent sense of self
1207167 really eh you might just want to hang out here a bit eh the weather is worse to the south i just came through there
1207168 we do have pictures of it over there if that helps
1207169 ill take you there well have to go by car so youll need to follow me
1207170 you filter the cues that you get from others through your self concept
1207171 children behave in ways that perpetuate what they have experienced
1207172 a child who had an unresponsive mother will act obnoxious or withdrawn so that people will want to keep their distance those with consistently responsive mothers are confident and connect well with their peers
1207173 we expect other people to see that same view immediately
1207174 we take things at face value and dont really have the means to infer others judgments
1207175 you will control the impression you give and your self perception will be more accurate
1207176 they are able to detect emotions on others faces and to feel empathy
1207177 the more accurate you are about how others perceive you the better you fare socially
1207178 think of a person who thinks hes really funny but isnt he interprets polite laughter as genuine laughter but everyone is on to him and annoyed by him
1207179 people are too dazzled or intimidated to react honestly to them
1207180 you must let them know that your approval is conditional upon their honesty with you
1207181 imagine trying to be charming while alone on a desert island
1207182 first of all people are less honest about their own negative traits
1207183 and many of these are stealth traits youd have to know someone really well to have any thoughts on whether or not he feels empty inside for example
1207184 it leads you to overanalyze others reactions to you and misinterpret them
1207185 you could always ask a family member or someone else who knows you are stuck with them to tell you honestly what they think of you
1207186 it was challenging to take it in but really helpful
1207187 theres always a trade off between how you want to feel and what you want to know

1207235 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1207236 the web has faced fragmented video standards for over a decade now
1207237 everyones experienced broken video support whether it be a flash plug in that crashes or an unsupported browser
1207238 if these things were to just work that would be a huge improvement in the browsing experience we will have the same user experience with videos and other multimedia that we currently have with images
1207239 theres the official standards then the kind of force of nature standards
1207240 you get this tipping point a most people use it so i want to use it kind of thing
1207241 eventually the platform represents a significant point and then all of a sudden stuff thats proprietary looks kind of stranded and obsolete
1207242 its not like some magic is going to happen these kind of things tend to move over time kind of like the adoption of the firefox browser itself
1207243 its not like microsoft hasnt used ogg in the past the halo games for pc used ogg vorbis for all of their music for instance
1207244 it would just be present and work and they wouldnt have to fuss about it thats the end goal for open source
1207245 any time you put something thats open it offers the opportunity for more people to do more interesting innovative things with it
1207246 when we sold our house we gave you 500 to help you and didnt ask for any of it back

1207251 climate isnt changing in unusual ways or if it is human activities are not the cause
1207252 ok its changing and humans are playing a role but it wont do much harm
1207253 yes climate disruption is going to do some real damage but its too late too difficult or too costly to avoid that so well just have to hunker down and suffer
1207254 the scientific consensus is so strong and so universal there are just a handful of doubters on this
1207255 yet those doubters get such high media attention and a lot of support
1207256 you are sticking your head in the sand if you think you should just wait for the us and russia to do their bit
1207257 there has to be leadership so i applaud australia for its attempts to provide leadership

1207262 photo of house under several feet of graphically rendered flood water
1207263 some expert will tell us that this storm might be a harbinger of global warming
1207264 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
1207265 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1207266 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
1207267 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
1207268 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
1207269 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
1207270 when the medical staff say you shouldnt go on then i think its probably time to listen
1207271 even when i snapped my achilles i said can i play again or am i finished and they said oh nah six to nine months well get you back wilson said

1207282 look i am going to call the captain if you continue you are being aggressive about the drink thing and we said no go back to your seat and put your seatbelt on
1207283 when you look at the way that we educate the players and theyre role models and we guide them and support them and allow them to understand the consequences of these sort of actions and for one of our key players let alone the fact that he was with other teammates drinking on sunday five days before a game so it was a pretty disappointing start to the day yesterday
1207284 and then to finish the day finding out that two of our players had lied to the club and made the situation worse pretty disappointing day all round
1207285 rest assured the club is built on trust and to have players lying to coaches and ceos and presidents its very serious
1207286 they are doing the same thing car stereo salesmen do talking about peak power output when the important value is rms power

1207290 the poor in developing countries spend roughly half of their household incomes on food
1207291 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1207292 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1207293 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1207294 but when it comes to an assisted living project the village said no
1207295 i think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur
1207296 if you buy the ftse you are not buying the uk economy
1207297 it is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they dont
1207298 they are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well but when they fall they fall the furthest
1207299 the ones that became hot spots then collapsed vietnam doubled and halved shanghai tripled and then halved again the stockmarkets that didnt attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past werent subject to the same excess or capital flight
1207300 our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride

1207305 anyway this same dr zack worked for gilead sciences in 2000 this is the same gilead sciences that invented tamiflu which has become popular and profitable after the bird flu scare this is the same gilead sciences that makes popular medicines treating aids that many people believe was developed in american military laboratories and who owns gilead sciences a major stockholder is none other than neocon donald rumsfeld who at one time was its ceo also tony blair of england who joined bush in the invasions of afghanistan and iraq and tom brokaw who had received one of the anthrax letters and another major shareholder is none other than neocon cindy mccain possibly the next first lady of the us
1207306 karl another great hit thanks again remember the neocon gwb insider jerome hauer hes the guy who was spreading the word to other administration insiders to start taking the cipro drug just prior to the anthrax mailouts

1207316 we dont expect a lot of rain because of the tropical storm but we are on alert in case it could cause flooding
1207317 it doesnt take a lot of flooding to be dangerous so we do caution people to be ready to evacuate their homes
1207318 we provide a lot of support up to 650 per person which sounds like a lot but when you consider the costs of putting people in hotel rooms and providing for food clothing and prescription medication for these people then it doesnt go very far at all
1207319 and dry conditions have led to things getting hotter than usual
1207320 last year we had too much water and that was also hard too but its not as bad as drought
1207321 it doesnt matter how much water you get them the heat wont let them grow any bigger

1207323 if an essential part of web 2 0 is harnessing collective intelligence turning the web into a kind of global brain the blogosphere is the equivalent of constant mental chatter in the forebrain the voice we hear in all of our heads it may not reflect the deep structure of the brain which is often unconscious but is instead the equivalent of conscious thought and as a reflection of conscious thought and attention the blogosphere has begun to have a powerful effect

1207349 but if iowa showed anything its that its not wise to underestimate obamas approach as every political observer knows the themes a politician uses on the campaign trail often dont match his or her style of governance once elected thats rarely considered a good thing but in this case people seeking real change should hope that obamas feel good language is just campaign spin
1207350 if he wins can we trust him to do what we want
1207351 thats because progressives best hope with barack obama would be that he use his message of hope and reconciliation to bring millions of new voters into the process for the first time gather an enormous amount of political capital and then turn around take off the gloves and shove that mandate right down the gops throat
1207352 that the good senator wants us to follow and believe
1207353 as every political observer knows the themes a politician uses on the campaign trail often dont match his or her style of governance once elected thats rarely considered a good thing but in this case people seeking real change should hope that obamas feel good language is just campaign spin

1207366 italians use more of arabica for italian coffees like espresso and cappuccino
1207367 espresso is the mother of all italian coffees and is typically made with a ratio of 60 arabica and 40 robusta
1207368 arabica is stronger of the two with robusta blended in to make the coffee milder
1207369 it is italian make and costs over four lakhs we use it to prepare espresso coffee syrup the machine is used only to prepare espresso
1207370 another of my colleagues might be at the counter tomorrow
1207371 some people might prefer lesser concentrations of chicory blended in typically 10 others might go in for a higher concentration upto 30 of chicory
1207372 half ground coffee powder goes in first followed by three fourths piping hot water after 5 10 minutes i press the mixture like this coffee dust settles down while the decoction rises up then the coffee decoction is added to hot milk for a cup of filter coffee for coffee packs to take home you could try the shop by the pool they stock freshly ground coffee for our customers they should have chicory on sale too
1207373 those are roasted coffee beans robusta coffee beans are the larger of the two
1207374 we use monsoon malabar a coffee variety local to coorg it is also grown in mangalore and chickmangalore among other places in south india it is just like wild coffee and does not require a blend or anything it even looks different tastes different too

1207376 a group of friends were working on a project gender spaces essentially about how women negotiate public spaces they asked me to shoot for that project
1207377 but i wasnt quite comfortable with the approach they suggested it was a direct approach
1207378 a direct approach doesnt work i mean how do you show something as intangible as discomfort in a photograph so i refused but it was kind of going on in my head at a certain point i heard people talk compartment mein aisa drawing tha and all that
1207379 and suddenly started seeing it all over again more consciously than id seen it earlier thats actually what kind of got me into doing this set of pictures
1207380 people are sitting neeche underneath i mean they could take offence they might think youre photographing them along with that explicit graffiti most of the time people dont realize what youre doing but i dont think thats the point the point is you dont want to get into an ugly scene
1207381 so the point was not to get confrontational unnecessarily in a train ive been in lots of confrontational it didnt make sense to get confrontational and i mean how do you start explaining this photographing graffiti to people passengers so i was trying to see if i could do it without making it obvious that i was photographing
1207382 i could preview the photographs i would be probably sitting there in the local train and its like taking aim 28 mm hai aisa shoot karega tho if i shoot it from here itll need to be at 28 mm you kind of lift your camera up and take a shot and check it in preview mode and then you do the next frame which is your final frame
1207383 tube light mein tho jaan nikal jaati hai it gets difficult to shoot in tube light digital allowed me to address the white balance because they were all shot at odd hours
1207384 there are friends who work at pukar so when you have varied friends somebody says something and an idea comes up my previous show the one rupee entrepreneur also came about while on an assignment with pukar i was conducting a workshop on how to document a city for a group of students and that idea the one rupee entrepreneur came out of there we were trying to do a fairly odd exercise and that came out of that so you never know what might strike you when
1207385 i never expected it to draw the response it did
1207386 with the greatest possible speed or promptness to come to a friends aid posthaste
1207387 expressing years of pent up fury at my husband because he has just recently been treated adequately for the mood disorder that used to lead to unbloggability and police involvement and so now i feel safe and oh man am i ever angry it comes out at the slightest opportunity the wrath of having spent the last five years of health i had trying to please someone who rejected the best of everything i had to offer can come out over something like him taking my vitamins and then its awwwwwwn and i am a total raving bitch
1207388 hahaha my husband has gained like twenty more pounds since he started taking depakote and kept claiming it was fluid weight so i told him to put his manhood where his mouth was and take one of my 40 mg
1207389 even if it comes to nothing and i still hurt just as much after im literally straightened out its always nice to have hope yknow
1207390 it sounds like youre getting a lot of answers and making some progress with your general health and also like your thyroid levels are where they need to be although of course i wont know until i see bloodwork id hate to have to tweak your synthroid any since youre feeling so much better but well just see we dont want to throw your heart out of rhythm or anything

1207615 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1207616 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1207617 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce

1207624 opposition leader datuk seri anwar ibrahim is unlikely to be arrested until a new dna bill is passed in parliament later this month
1207625 favre wasnt interested in the job and the vicodins vikings werent offering one
1207626 someone had pulled my camera strap when i took photographs of anwar i shouted jangan tolak dont push and pulled back my camera because i was scared it would fall
1207627 after anwar left the area a man wearing a pkr vest shouted at me saying i was not allowed to take pictures at such close range
1207628 i told him that i was just doing my job and did not want to quarrel with him he moved towards me as though he was going to hit me
1207629 next thing i know a group of men had surrounded me and someone grabbed me and pulled my t shirt
1207630 suddenly i felt someones hand on my throat choking me i pushed as hard as i could to get away as i was trying to escape i felt a painful blow to the back of my head
1207631 i dont know who hit me from behind and i do not know who strangled me it was just a blur of hands and bodies
1207632 all i was thinking at that time was that i needed to go back to office and quickly send my pictures as the deadline was near
1207633 previously when we covered anwar in july at the same place the photographers were badly treated
1207634 this cannot go on and i not only speak for myself but for all the photographers who are on duty
1207635 the simplest and most accessible key to our self neglected liberation lies right here personal non participation in lies
1207636 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1207637 make detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the stability and security of the transport system
1207638 at this stage theres no reason to think that the beijing olympic games are any less secure than previous games and in fact they may be the most secure games weve ever seen
1207639 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1207640 to refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1207641 will only serve to increase suppression of the uighur people and exacerbate tensions between uighurs and han chinese
1207642 but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom
1207643 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day any day
1207644 it will be a good sign on election day if there are a lot of bikes parked outside the polling places of america
1207645 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
1207646 thats significantly pushed the us dollar higher and hurt the aussie and the kiwi dollars and other currencies
1207647 the selling pressure on the australian dollar has come from the fact weve had a fall in commodity prices and weve seen a rebound in the us dollar
1207648 over us 20 a barrel drop that should have translated into a much greater drop in the price of petrol at the bowsers
1207649 i found this amusing they were saying biggest drop theyd seen in four years
1207650 it should have been more theyre patting themselves on the back but theyre still ripping motorists off
1207651 i think were going to see petrol prices continue to go down
1207652 i think well go down to the lower 100s and that should see us with petrol prices back into the 1 20 per litre
1207653 but at the moment were still a few cents over what we should be
1207654 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
1207655 thats when youve got to bear down and really pitch
1207656 anytime you get a guy or two on base and keep him from scoring thats pretty good and hard to do
1207657 i was ahead in the count and i tried to sneak a fastball by him
1207658 thats one thing i wish i would have done differently
1207659 growing up i never thought id hit one home run much less 100

1207662 they are acquiring companies they need us to support them in their capital requirements and trade requirements we will support their aspirations across the globe
1207663 tata wants us to be autonomous ive got all the executive authority i need to make both the day to day and the long term executive decisions without having to consult with ratan tata and ravi kant tata automotives chief executive my fellow board members
1207664 in terms of governance we have set up a small strategy board ratan ravi and me and we will meet every couple of months and review progress on plans strategies and future products
1207665 there are two or three areas where it would be good to bring in their expertise
1207666 land rover is on an improving trend while jaguar is making great strides and getting close to profitability
1207667 we have a strong emphasis on the uk automotive sector it is very important to have local supply
1207668 both economies are still growing strongly and each country has comparative advantages in certain sectors so we expect the trade flow to increase we are well positioned to assist those companies operating in these markets
1207669 dont be too alarmed even when studies come out and seem hopeless
1207670 with a few swaps and switches people really can make healthier choices at these fast food joints especially when the decisions are made before going in
1207671 many of these restaurants have the nutrition information online that you can print out and go over with your kids even before you go so that everybody is on the same page before they pull up to the drive through or head to the counter
1207672 instead of getting the fries go with the apple slices many restaurants offer carrot sticks or apple slices or no sugar added applesauce or oranges which make a big difference over deep fried fries
1207673 instead of the deep fried nuggets go for something like the grilled chicken and you will save fat grams and calories
1207674 you cant go wrong with unsweetened iced tea water or a skim milk

1207677 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets mr lewis said
1207678 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between 3 and 4 per cent
1207679 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1207680 we have to bear in mind the implications of a rise on the absorptive capacity of the borrowers some of them may be ready for an increase in rates but it may also raise the risk of default
1207681 but yes they are aware of our concern on growth and we expect them to factor it in when they decide on a rate hike
1207682 so i was bangin this guy in the ace the guy reaches around and grabs my balls what a fag
1207683 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1207684 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1207685 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive
1207686 once confidence is shaken and markets become fragile it does take a reasonable period of time for markets to recover from that
1207687 we help clients to manage through these cycles if everything only went up then nobody would need organisations like us
1207688 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region
1207689 our other asian operations continue to offer us exciting opportunities for growth

1207709 me parece muy significativo que en la normalidad democr tica se pueda ahondar en las coincidencias sin menospreciar las diferencias
1207710 andr s est muy bien que creas en la competencia democr tica sin embargo para la mayor a de los que esta aqu la competencia democr tica no significa lo mismo que para t en este proceso ver s a las peores clientelas moverse ver s dinero salir de lugares inimaginables y sobre todo ver s a la personas sacar lo peor de s mismas

1207722 so as you see my hands look bald like jeza and baby georgies head
1207723 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1207724 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1207725 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1207726 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1207727 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1207728 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1207729 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1207730 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1207731 este es un momento muy significativo porque esta etapa es muy esperada por el poder judicial y por la sociedad porque estas ciudades judiciales necesitan comenzar a tener una forma ya m s definida de avance y de se al hacia la gente respecto al esfuerzo que el estado pone para generar mejores condiciones de trabajo para la judicatura y para el servicio que la justicia presta a la gente
1207732 el estado ten a deudas m s urgentes con la sociedad y privilegi en esta materia de lo urgente mejorar la calidad de vida de la gente en cuestiones esenciales como la educaci n la salud la vivienda y el acceso a trav s de servicios viales adecuados a trav s de la incorporaci n de personal en reas sensibles del estado y de esto de alguna manera posterg por un breve tiempo los esfuerzos en mejorar la situaci n edilicia del poder judicial
1207733 fue una decisi n la de privilegiar primero saldar primero las deudas m s urgentes con la gente y luego avanzar en cuestiones de fondo como tener ciudades judiciales que permitan en muchos a os solucionar el problema del h bitat de la resoluci n de las causas judiciales y del trabajo de empleados y funcionarios
1207734 m s all de que es un paso importante y muy significativo no va a ser el fin de la ciudad judicial por lo tanto vamos a tener que seguir sumando esfuerzos paciencia y voluntad para que el servicio de justicia mejorare no s lo desde la tarea de jueces y funcionarios sino adem s de tener mejores lugares en los cuales la gente pueda recibir el servicio de justicia y adem s empelados y funcionarios puedan cumplir con su tarea
1207735 were following up on some leads that the individual depending on who the individual ends up being may have some connections to plumas county but until hes identified im not able to say more
1207736 the person who caused that death is jeffery sims but what are the facts surrounding the death and what is the truth of the intent of mr sims
1207737 our families are truly honored that we have been asked to do this and we all look forward to this wonderful event
1207738 there are probably about two dozen species that qualify as freshwater megafishes in the world and my best guess is that about 70 percent of those are in danger of extinction
1207739 the mekong catfish in southeastern asia is very close to extinction
1207740 the closest to extinction is the chinese paddlefish which is found in yangtze river in china it may be extinct now because no one has seen it since 2003
1207741 when you hear a species is in danger that means a set of criteria has been used to determine if a species might go extinct
1207742 many of these megafishes have not been evaluated and until a species is evaluated usually nothing is done to try to protect it
1207743 the freshwater stingray was not even determined by scientists to be a new species until 1990
1207744 the reason we do that is if you know which areas of the river are important for the different stages of a fishs life cycle spawning rearing young feeding you can try to protect those very important areas
1207745 the fact these fish are so big is interesting to people and what makes their jaws drop when they see the photos but the point of this project is that these fish are in danger and we know almost nothing about them
1207746 were the first high school in nevada history to ever have been so deep into no child left behind sanctions and work our way out
1207747 the most exciting thing for me is that the kids that live in the hug zone can be proud of the school they belong to and know that its no longer labeled a failing school by the federal and state government
1207748 i hope it continues to show people that kids that attend hug high are great kids the teachers that work here are good teachers and weve created a great school for kids to attend
1207749 the way the economy is now everything just costs so much
1207750 groceries cost more and gas is so expensive its just ridiculous
1207751 my husband and i actually sold our car and decided to start taking the bus the buses are just so jam packed youve got a lot of people riding the bus now
1207752 as the price of oil increased in the last few years an increase in consumer prices is to be expected
1207753 but price increases are similar to a decrease in income so even though incomes increased slightly that was still chewed up by the increase in prices
1207754 many homeowners dont have equity to take out and use and that has affected the retail section of the economy
1207755 in the short term fuel prices need to be the first thing to come down if you want to see an immediate impact in consumer spending
1207756 anything can happen of course but i think the u s economy has been extremely resilient
1207757 youve had these oil price increases a credit crunch and the housing downturn its amazing that we really havent had a recession
1207758 this partnership gives our students yet another pathway to achieving their goals and realizing their possibilities
1207759 it is the result of really listening to what students need to succeed and finding ways to help them reach those goals
1207760 for someone who wants to move through their education with a career at the end we now have a straight path to offer them for a lot of people that makes all the difference

1207768 i dont really know its been appearing there off and on for the past week as you can imagine i refuse to use this toilet when something is watching this is the main reason i called you in the thing appeared this morning and hasnt moved since
1207769 since you finally decide to ask i am an otter in fact i am a liquid otter from venus you otter know these things earthling
1207770 you earthling are just asking to be shrunk you are a nitwit
1207771 im sorry venusian i dont shrink in the wash and you are a drip
1207772 true technically very true but we still plan to invade your planet we have an especially fun fate in store for your country
1207773 well since im dumb enough to be talking to a watery otter from venus who showed up in a toilet bowl i may as well be dumb enough to ask how youre gong to invade
1207774 splendid wonderful how you earthlings always catch on to the plot lines so quickly we will destroy your country by applying our reduction rays to your supply distribution bases during after hours of course we arent primitives
1207775 your stores earthling sears safeway that sort of thing we take great joy in using supply centers for target practice with our shrink rays all the merchandise squeezes out the windows as they shrink
1207776 so what do you do when youve shrunk them all and what if we pour draino on you or radioactive waste
1207777 oh that kind of junk goes right through us venusians you might be able to steam a few of us which would be a pain in the gas but any plan by earth to defeat venus simply wont hold water actually though we do have a few problems once weve shrunk all of a planets distribution centers we often get bored and go home
1207778 we shall probably have to many venusians generally congregate to one planet at a time to join in the target practice but we quickly run out of distribution centers to reduce imagine hundreds of thousands of venusians just sitting around with nothing amusing left to do you would see a water otter everywhere and not a shop to shrink

1207780 i think this is really going to be a good farmfest this year probably is one of the biggest ones in the last few years
1207781 the corn prices are up the dairy is up and all the crops are up so it should be a real good show
1207782 i know housing starts are and i watch the news myself and you know there are foreclosures and stuff like that where the farm economy has been very very good
1207783 and you know crop prices are some days at an all time high here in 08 and there are some guys really reaping some benefits of it
1207784 weve seen a true growth spurt in the guidance products due to input costs rising and things of that nature
1207785 its all about dialing it down to every cent and if you can find ways to save money and put more bushels in your grain tank guys have really opened their eyes up to that technology
1207786 its being made in duluth its for residential or farm type applications it will make about what a normal house will use in a month
1207787 many farmers potentially have available capital but also recognize that every input cost they have also has increased
1207788 so while we may look at the ag business and farm business and say boy there should be a lot of capital here to invest theres also a lot of expenses
1207789 the net effect is that maybe there isnt as much investment opportunity or profit opportunity as one might think

1207816 feminists should stop eating meat because here are a bunch of anecdotes about how men treat women like meat and about how pornography looks at women like meat and how meat is thought of vital to masculinity therefore it is imperative to you as a feminist who are disgusted by all pornography all erotic representations of women and masculinity in general to stop eating meat out of principle

1207831 frankly im not concerned with what hezbollah assumes hezbollah is a terrorist organization funded trained and equipped by the islamic iranian revolutionary guard corps my responsibility is not to concern myself with how hezbollah perceives me nor do i feel any compulsion to court them they are the enemy as far as i m concerned my responsibility is to deliver the facts to my readers which i have always done and will always do

1207834 on a populist site lebanese forces a poster named drinkaholic whose location is noted as somewhere near lebanon put things in perspective on the forum on december 7 i can see that hezbollah is acting in a very wrong way it has become like a state within state where for example it even has sort of like it s sic own police force in dahieh lt i gt another post concluded hezbollah now has a huge base of weapons and so other sects feel threatened by this now and won t accept to see such a large amount of weapons held by just one party visitors to the site commented in the discussion thread on hezbollah s physical strength and presence in lebanon

1207913 hey mark i was wondering how long did it take for you to get your role on stargate from your first audition were you part of 3 top auditions for the role or did you just get it with no other real competition thanks mark
1207914 question for mark dacascos ive heard youre a super nice guy is it difficult playing a not so good guy on screen im thinking particularly of your betrayal scene with jason momoa the one in which hes tied to the chair and is so very very emotional it was hard to watch was it hard to play
1207915 mark loved your appearances on sga when is joe going to make an appearance on iron chef america what did you like best about working on the show sga other than food and acting what other interests do you have thanks bunches
1207916 question for mark d do you have formal martial arts training if so in what discipline s and how long have you been studying the sword fight was absolutely great cant wait to see the whole thing included in the dvd box set next year
1207917 your portrayal of tyre was amazingly haunting and caused me to shout out loud
1207918 my question to mark dacascos first thanks for stopping by and answering our questions
1207919 questions for mark did you know from the get go what your characters fate would be either way how did you feel about it when you found out
1207920 a few questions for mr dacascos and ill call it a night
1207921 a question two rather for mark dacascos as an iron chef america fan and iron chef overall i am curious if you ever get full in the middle of the judging segment i always wonder if one could get full depending on the portioning also a possibility of our own joseph mallozzi becoming a judge the man has quite an appetite and always talks about his culinary adventures
1207922 and i have a question for mark dacascos with your extensive martial arts background did you find it harder to prepare for the fight scenes or for the dramatic scenes like tyres withdrawal i thought both were really well done
1207923 it must be immensely satisfying as a guest star to have the opportunity to play such a complex character to have a strong backstory to work from and a full arc to explore from bad guy to redemption my question is did you prefer playing dark side tyre or redeemed hero tyre
1207924 to mark dacascos i thought you were great in this episode joe m has mentioned that jason really likes tyres sword did you find it a nice weapon to use as well also if i may ask a non sga question i often drool at the culinary concoctions on iron chef america as chairman do you get to sample the dishes too have there ever been any duds
1207925 really enjoyed your work on broken ties weve seen your involvement in iron chef is that your primary interest right now do you have any other projects coming up where we might see you act
1207926 thanks for talking to us we really appreciate it did you enjoy working with bambam and jason how many times did you have to practice the sword fight before filming
1207927 1 i understand that actors try to get close to the characters they play are you pleased that in the end tyler cast off his traitor image to become the hero 2 characters that appear on sa have a habit of coming back from the dead if joe brought tyler back would you be up for a rematch with the wraith
1207928 question for mark d what was the most fulfilling scene in broken ties for you what was the most difficult for you physically and or emotionally

1207940 how are you going to top last years program it was fantastic
1207941 not only did the client completely change strategic direction they also changed the demographics of the winners at the same time
1207942 because of the varied business disciplines involved we needed to create a much more casual program one that better accommodated a diverse group of attendees with our clients selection of hawaii as their destination we will be replacing the museums and cultural opportunities with high energy activities and interactive evening events
1207943 hotels are quoting rates in dollars vs euros they are guaranteeing an exchange rate for a prescribed period of time they are offering excellent deals in shoulder periods
1207944 instead of offering paris for example we might suggest a program in carcassonne france or barcelona spain where the dollar will go much further cruises are also a popular trend for meetings and incentives to help stretch budget dollars
1207945 the socio cultural phenomenon of people wanting to be larger than themselves is increasing yearly and is widely making its way into incentive programs
1207946 you will see the concept of sustainable events more and more in future programs take for example sites new crystal award category called most outstanding sustainable event they offered two new awards in this category in 2007
1207947 i think its more than a passing trend when an organization like site acknowledges outstanding efforts in this area
1207948 but as event planners and partners we need to push our clients and tell them that its here to stay we are responsible for helping our clients change things up for their participants yes its still about awarding and being recognized but were taking this concept to a new broader level
1207949 our industry needs to be very aware of how we impact the environment with our programs another one of jnrs clients was very concerned about excess food not consumed at their events and we found a way to donate the leftovers to a worthy cause
1207950 this instant information accessibility can be frustrating for the planners when we recommend certain five star rated properties and true incentive quality hotels or resorts to a client only to have the client respond
1207951 the difference in a rating from a travel magazine and ratings that incentive companies rely on is tremendous
1207952 travel magazine ratings are often readers polls and the information has been compiled from the fit traveler
1207953 within his eyes you can see the possibility of someone like him devoting his life to something this extreme there had to be an intense brooding quality alongside an animalistic aggression in his nature christian insisted that every detail must contribute to this end especially the batsuit

1207956 because she loves them both for sharing her fight to make gotham a better place it really comes down to who is more noble in her eyes harvey does what he has to do to make things right but he does not go above the law batman does whatever is necessary to stop crime and corruption by any and all means available to him in addition to all the cool toys lol he chooses to operate outside of the system because of how corrupt it has become harvey on the other hand acknowledges the system is broken and still chooses to operate from the inside the law despite the corruption therefore she chooses harvey because they can battle together on common ground
1207957 dont make me your one chance for a normal life
1207958 i just thought of rachel as a whole new woman i dont think it wouldve served anyone for me to try and imitate katie you cant do that as an actress i have to feel open to do my own thing it was important to me that she be smart feisty and real not just the girl in the action movie whose only job is to act scared
1207959 chris nolan insisted that we all play everything for truth so much so that at times it didnt even feel like a comic book movie as if including batman was incidental to the crime drama we were filming a lot of times in big movies the truth gets overlooked or just doesnt matter
1207960 even though the situations were often larger than life and based in fantasy he wanted us to play all of those moments with as much emotional honesty as we could find in them

1207967 apa gunanya seorang memperoleh seluruh dunia tetapi kehilangan nyawanya dan apakah yang dapat diberikannya sebagai ganti nyawanya
1207968 sebab hal kerajaan sorga sama seperti seorang yang mau bepergian ke luar negeri yang memanggil hamba hambanya dan mempercayakan hartanya kepada mereka 15 yang seorang diberikannya lima talenta yang seorang lagi dua dan yang seorang lain lagi satu masing masing menurut kesanggupannya lalu ia berangkat 16 segera pergilah hamba yang menerima lima talenta itu ia menjalankan uang itu lalu beroleh laba lima talenta 17 hamba yang menerima dua talenta itupun berbuat demikian juga dan berlaba dua talenta 18 tetapi hamba yang menerima satu talenta itu pergi dan menggali lobang di dalam tanah lalu menyembunyikan uang tuannya 19 lama sesudah itu pulanglah tuan hamba hamba itu lalu mengadakan perhitungan dengan mereka 20 hamba yang menerima lima talenta itu datang dan ia membawa laba lima talenta katanya tuan lima talenta tuan percayakan kepadaku lihat aku telah beroleh laba lima talenta 21 maka kata tuannya itu kepadanya baik sekali perbuatanmu itu hai hambaku yang baik dan setia engkau telah setia dalam perkara kecil aku akan memberikan kepadamu tanggung jawab dalam perkara yang besar masuklah dan turutlah dalam kebahagiaan tuanmu 22 lalu datanglah hamba yang menerima dua talenta itu katanya tuan dua talenta tuan percayakan kepadaku lihat aku telah beroleh laba dua talenta 23 maka kata tuannya itu kepadanya baik sekali perbuatanmu itu hai hambaku yang baik dan setia engkau telah setia memikul tanggung jawab dalam perkara yang kecil aku akan memberikan kepadamu tanggung jawab dalam perkara yang besar masuklah dan turutlah dalam kebahagiaan tuanmu 24 kini datanglah juga hamba yang menerima satu talenta itu dan berkata tuan aku tahu bahwa tuan adalah manusia yang kejam yang menuai di tempat di mana tuan tidak menabur dan yang memungut dari tempat di mana tuan tidak menanam 25 karena itu aku takut dan pergi menyembunyikan talenta tuan itu di dalam tanah ini terimalah kepunyaan tuan 26 maka jawab tuannya itu hai kamu hamba yang jahat dan malas jadi kamu sudah tahu bahwa aku menuai di tempat di mana aku tidak menabur dan memungut dari tempat di mana aku tidak menanam 27 karena itu sudahlah seharusnya uangku itu kauberikan kepada orang yang menjalankan uang supaya sekembaliku aku menerimanya serta dengan bunganya 28 sebab itu ambillah talenta itu dari padanya dan berikanlah kepada orang yang mempunyai sepuluh talenta itu 29 karena setiap orang yang mempunyai kepadanya akan diberi sehingga ia berkelimpahan tetapi siapa yang tidak mempunyai apapun juga yang ada padanya akan diambil dari padanya 30 dan campakkanlah hamba yang tidak berguna itu ke dalam kegelapan yang paling gelap di sanalah akan terdapat ratap dan kertak gigi

1207982 ada suatu kemalangan yang telah kulihat di bawah matahari yang sangat menekan manusia orang yang dikaruniai allah kekayaan harta benda dan kemuliaan sehingga ia tak kekurangan suatupun yang diingininya tetapi orang itu tidak dikaruniai kuasa oleh allah untuk menikmatinya melainkan orang lain yang menikmatinya inilah kesia siaan dan penderitaan yang pahit pengkhotbah 6 1 2 dengan jerih payahnya kerja keras tanpa mengenal batas waktu seorang pelaku bisnis mencari uang semakin banyak diperoleh dirasakan semakin kurang sehingga hidupnya terbelit dalam lingkaran dan ikatan sulit bisa keluar serangan jantung dan stroke biasanya akrab dengan mereka belum lagi kolesterol tinggi tekanan darah tinggi sakit maag karena makan tidak teratur dan ditambah komplikasi diabetes akibatnya makan pun harus dibatasi ditimbang beratnya dan dibatasi jenisnya pengkhotbah mengatakan itu merupakan kesia siaan dan penderitaan yang pahit kedua ajal menjemput dengan tiba tiba tanpa disangka sangka di luar dugaan ketika yang bersangkutan belum siap seperti anak muda yang lihai berdagang dalam lukas 12 15 21 dimana ia berkata kepada dirinya ku akan merombak lumbung lumbungku dan aku akan mendirikan yang lebih besar dan aku akan menyimpan di dalamnya segala gandum dan barang barangku sesudah itu aku akan berkata kepada jiwaku jiwaku ada padamu banyak barang tertimbun untuk bertahun tahun lamanya beristirahatlah makanlah minumlah dan bersenang senanglah tetapi firman allah kepadanya hai engkau orang bodoh pada malam ini juga jiwamu akan diambil dari padamu dan apa yang telah kausediakan untuk siapakah itu nanti demikianlah jadinya dengan orang yang mengumpulkan harta bagi dirinya sendiri jikalau ia tidak kaya di hadapan allah
1207983 tuhanlah yang empunya bumi serta segala isinya dan dunia serta yang diam di dalamnya
1207984 maka janganlah kaukatakan dalam hatimu kekuasaanku dan kekuatan tangankulah yang membuat aku memperoleh kekayaan ini tetapi haruslah engkau ingat kepada tuhan allahmu sebab dialah yang memberikan kepadamu kekuatan untuk memperoleh kekayaan dengan maksud meneguhkan perjanjian yang diikrarkan nya dengan sumpah kepada nenek moyangmu seperti sekarang ini
1207985 bukan setiap orang yang berseru kepada ku tuhan tuhan akan masuk ke dalam kerajaan sorga melainkan dia yang melakukan kehendak bapa ku yang di sorga

1207995 well thats very convenient of them to say that but i believe that the buck has to stop with the people who institute the system
1207996 to have anyone with a mistake in their payroll is unacceptable and thats the reason why my team is here as well as the agency teams that are working 10 to 12 hours a day

1208224 damn it you probably think agenda is a hot looking chick on t v
1208225 i know what agenda means conrad i just dont know what you mean
1208226 bits and pieces just bits and pieces and soundbites they call that news nothing but opinion and speculation not a trace of information look at her stupid bitch shes in every shot and frame shes the one telling us what to think shes putting the words into these bastards mouths
1208227 you see what im talking about man shes fucking everywhere
1208228 you need more coffee man cuz youre not jittery at all
1208229 you know what im talking about though right that bitch is in every fucking frame
1208230 but she is the newscaster she has to be on the screen to newscast
1208231 shes on there to make sure that the stations opinion is delivered that you and i understand exactly what were suppose to understand
1208232 it may not make a difference to you but it does make all the difference in the grander scheme of things
1208233 relax ya sure i think one of us relaxing is more than enough man how can you be so stupid information doesnt matter to you how we get it who gives it to us
1208234 oh yeah and what news do you watch mr happy
1208235 ah son of a nightline ted coppell that big headed airbag that motherfucker may aswell come on tv in his underwear and a pompadour that fucking clown is your window to the world
1208236 well i also watch some foreign news stations out of europe and the middle east
1208237 europe and the middle east the bbc fucking al jazeera
1208238 and thats youre fucking news is that what makes you happy didnt you realize by now in your infinite fucking wisdom that this is actually opinion not news
1208239 all these fucking tv stations are nothing but convoluted opinions and watered down news
1208240 they are the opinions of the governments interest groups and contributors and so long as there are contributors there will never be a free flow of information look at these fucking newscasters theyre everywhere on the screen you cant look away from them you shouldnt or else youll lose track of their opinion the more neatly dressed and cute they are the more happy people like you are tempted to watch theyve downgraded news to mere fucking entertainment the other day i was watching a report on the death toll of hurricane nargis the fucking reporter was so fucking attractive and decked up i didnt know whether i should feel sad or get a freakin hard on not a trace of human emotion on that bitchs face maybe just happiness for getting the job done sooner than her other big titted sorority sisters
1208241 whats wrong with that do you want your news to be read by some fat ugly bitch instead
1208242 i dont care if a naked janet reno reads the news to me i dont give a fuck who reads the news much less emphasize on how good they look i just want truth honest non opinionated news
1208243 relax conrad no need to get so rowelled up you dont have to agree with what theyre saying
1208244 im not getting rowelled up i just want honest straight forward news not some fucking georgetown pencilneck spoon feeding me what i should believe in some chick with a new boob job who was probably clipping her eyebrows before the cameraman told her shes on the air
1208245 so what conrad you want people to stop watching news television altogether
1208246 they should open up a t v station just for one day broadcast from somewhere in a remote indian reservation or aboard a pirate ship abandoned on international waters so they never get caught they need not worry too much cuz theyll only be on for a few hours before they shut down never to return again
1208247 a station that will broadcast years worth of investigative work in one day and not any investigative work im talking real explosive shit the whereabouts of bin laden the presidents sex life the pentagons top secrets the russian mafia and afghan drug lords connection to wall street the lavish lives of kings and fat sheiks and inbetween load it up with some snuff footage real rape caught on tape and evidence incriminating the most illusive of criminals who usually get to walk because some fucking juror thought with his ass more than with his brain ive been thinking a lot about this station the unknown station broadcasted once in a lifetime a defining moment in history that will forever separate people into those who have seen the station and those who havent
1208248 man its 4pm w need to get going if we want to catch a nap before heading back on the road
1208249 so what do you think about my idea the unknown station maybe a thief who just robbed a bank should operate this station no contributors equals no terms or conditions of broadcast he can say whatever the fuck he wants
1208250 hey woman you better replace your shawarma dinner with falafel or else im gonna leave your fat ass for a skinnier muzza

1208262 ter meus 20 e poucos anos tem sido f cil por m perturbador um tr nsito entre a ingenuidade e a mal cia e hora de decidir o que farei da vida
1208263 gra as aos meus pais tenho s algumas contas a pagar e muitos planos pela frente
1208264 n o sou muito ligada nessa coisa de cremes produtos de beleza e malha o e n o deixo de beber uma cervejinha com meus amigos por n ia mas de vez em quando bate aquele peso na consci ncia devia estar fazendo ioga nata o cuidando mais da minha sa de com 25 a gente come a a se preocupar com a chegada dos 30 das rugas e acaba ficando um pouco mais cuidadosa
1208265 dif cil para as pessoas nessa faixa et ria saber construir alguma coisa um relacionamento justamente pela individualidade e isso que muitos chamam de desapego na minha opini o essencial para o auto conhecimento
1208266 comecei a namorar quando tinha 17 anos e at hoje estou com o mesmo menininho que j n o t o menininho ter 25 anos e namorar h 8 assusta muita gente mas nem penso em jogar tudo pro alto o que eu tenho com ele provavelmente n o terei mais ent o quero aproveitar muito enquanto bom
1208267 a gente dan a canta ri desenha pinta bagun a fala besteira e quem quiser achar feio que ache sou bem feliz
1208268 vou insistir em fazer o que quero se n o der certo pelo menos eu sei que bati bastante a cabe a na parede
1208269 ter 30 anos um privil gio n s temos passado e futuro
1208270 aos trinta anos de idade a minha bunda caiu caiu de um dia pra outro sem me avisar a minha pele come ou a expor pro mundo todos os meus atalhos a come ou a minha peregri na o pelos cremes anti rugas cido retin ico extrato de ch verde andiroba os das farm cias de manipula o mel germen de trigo papaia protetor 100 sol jamais
1208271 ter trinta anos uma posi o de grande abrang ncia estrat gica voc pode namorar homens de 18 30 e 50 anos sem que ningu m te chame de tarada uma mulher de 30 anos uma metralhadora girat ria
1208272 acho que o melhor dos 30 a maturidade que voc de certa forma adquire eu disse de certa forma porque nessa idade ainda me sinto muito imatura mas com maior serenidade para decidir as coisas a grande porcaria que seu corpo muda ele fica mais mole mas voc fica mais inteligente eu acho que estou numa idade tima n o trocaria meus 30 pelos 20 de jeito nenhum e nem pelos 40
1208273 trocar os meus 40 anos pelos meus 20 seria o mesmo que trocar uma bicicleta novinha por um abridor de latas enferrujado na rea profissional quanto mais velho o escritor mais valorizado por conta disso me sinto cada vez melhor com a passagem do tempo
1208274 no quesito beleza aos 20 eu pesava 30 quilos a mais n o tinha feito uma cirurgia redutora dos seios e sem essa cirurgia eu provavelmente seria virgem at hoje n o havia encontrado um corte de cabelo que fosse a minha cara n o sabia me maquiar direito nem possu a uma personalidade definida ao me vestir
1208275 quando eu era mais jovem preocupava me mais comigo eu me achava mais bonita tinha uma carreira pela frente hoje sinto que estou no momento de repensar algumas coisas ser que adoto uma crian a continuo na minha profiss o ou jogo tudo pro alto e viajo pelo exterior
1208276 acho que depois dos 40 temos que transferir as preocupa es para o mundo sen o enlouquece
1208277 o resumo da pera uma palavra seguran a aos 40 a gente dan a frevo salsa e tango sem se desequilibrar no salto agulha
1208278 aos 20 a mulher aprende seus valores e desfruta da beleza para suas conquistas aos 30 est muito bela mas agora faz de seus valores uma conquista aos 40 utiliza o auge de sua beleza junto a seus verdadeiros valores e finalmente aos 50 descobre que beleza ter valores

1208313 when you look at it it should be straightforward but its really not
1208314 its really bumpy and the track rubbers down and gains a lot of grip during the race so you have to look forward to that to have a good car for the race having all these people backing me up team co owner john barnes and panther and delphi and national guard it gives me great confidence because i know the job was done right in the shop and i will have the same chance as others

1208326 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

1208416 this is not just a bunch of poems put together like the title implies this is an africa to america story the big story here is my story its our africans in america story i always write for my people africans in america these are our stories but i think others will benefit highly from it too its a small world out there and i truly believe we should all do our best to see through our neighbors eyes so yeah though i think africans in america will get it the most i believe any and everyone should read it and try to understand it at the very least it might give them the right questions to ask
1208417 i want africans to say whoa im not the only one living this i also want you to learn something you didnt already know
1208418 the source of one of the worlds most protracted refugee crises

1208430 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks
1208431 this investment by tiger airways of more than 105 million in aircraft assets in adelaide means more jobs in south australia with tiger airways recruiting pilots cabin crew and support staff to be based locally in adelaide
1208432 this will give interstate visitors more affordable opportunities to travel to south australia for their holidays injecting valuable tourism dollars into the local economy
1208433 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1208434 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1208435 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1208436 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1208437 please be ensured that at fosters we have done everything possible to ensure that this will never ever happen again
1208438 the article described how a u s m i a search team 27 years later excavated the crash site and recovered traces of their remains along with personal items belonging to the newsmen including lenses and other camera parts from that article came a book
1208439 yes its an adolescent consciousness young people like to look the same and behave the same the danger is when everyone looks the same feels the same and acts the same one catastrophe affects us all
1208440 whenever im facing a crisis and im certainly facing a crisis now i just fight harder i know im going to survive
1208441 we got a call from the penthouse office saying you are no longer with the company and they told us to send over all the materials layouts pictures etc we had at the house
1208442 whatever you might think of bob guccione he always took huge risks
1208443 bob challenged playboy at the peak of the sexual revolution
1208444 bob out raunched playboy by displaying genitalia and pubic hair in the magazine that had never been done before he knew what to sell to the 18 to 34 year old guy who accounted for 70 percent of his readership in the 70s and 80s he knew how to mix tabloid headlines sensationalistic muckraking journalism and dirty pictures it was a hell of a combination
1208445 and the models changed they were no longer innocents they were strippers or porn stars and theyd had face lifts or breast implants they werent as real
1208446 we were starved and then bob would throw a couple of big broiled steaks on the floor for the dogs to devour right in front of us and we were supposed to go on with the meeting as if nothing was happening
1208447 he always felt that the world should come to him you know its the old bring the mountain to muhammad and after a while hes just going to attract the flies like that after a while the only people that are going to come to you are the ones who have their hands out
1208448 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1208449 customers are telling us id get up 10 minutes earlier for this
1208450 one guarantee this tie cost less than john mccains shoes
1208451 you know i mean jake i will leave that up to you to make your analysis
1208452 one thing ive learned is to not read daily tracking polls if i had been reading daily tracking polls i think i would have quit right around august of last year wouldnt i
1208453 im not one to suggest that theres anything wrong with them hitting us hard on things that they fundamentally disagree with me on
1208454 i mean i think there is a very real difference in our tax policies there is a very real difference in our energy politics there is a very real difference in our health care policies and they have a right to make their arguments
1208455 my sense was last week wasnt about any of that stuff
1208456 it was all about seeing if they can slap onto me a certain caricature that will help carry them though the election
1208457 last week i think was just a series of distractions
1208458 it felt like you know i guess its a squid that sends out ink
1208459 no cake maureen dowd will write a story about you not eating cake dont want to be an elitist now
1208460 last week i think was just a series of distractions
1208461 there is no way in the world mccain will win
1208462 the old dominion has seen a burst of political activity unlike any in modern times
1208463 are organized into clearly delineated coalitions such as veterans sportsmen social conservatives and young republicans
1208464 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when it is a presidential race
1208465 where did you get these traits from definitely not from us
1208466 i have a lifetime tivo and a free dvr from my cable company i want a 3rd one i can get the cable one 1 2 the cost of tivo
1208467 we pioneered dvr if it wasnt for tivo there would be no dvr
1208468 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1208469 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
1208470 the inherent worth and dignity of each individual justice equity and compassion in human relations and the goal of world community with peace liberty and justice for all
1208471 a long and rich history of taking stands for social justice
1208472 we were keenly aware that it could have been us
1208473 love is the spirit of this church and service is its law this is our great covenant to dwell together in peace to seek the truth in love and to help one another
1208474 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1208475 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events our bill becoming law means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1208476 it is a relief to say that this part of our fight is coming to an end theres still more work to be done and the families arent done fighting for the truth
1208477 there are still a lot of things that we want to know
1208478 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1208481 beijing police indicated that during the torch relay through beijing they will adopt a range of measures to ensure the smooth running of the torch relay
1208482 these include temporary controls on major intersections and roads that the torch relay passes dispersal of crowds beforehand and traffic diversion
1208483 you know how tyra likes to do that stuff and shell get a lot of press off it
1208484 no hay derecho a ser condenado a la pobreza por nacer pobre
1208485 debemos construir una nueva independencia y en esta tarea debemos estar los hombres y mujeres que elegidos democr ticamente tenemos el desaf o de luchar contra la pobreza la inequidad y la desigualdad no hay derecho a ser condenado a la pobreza por nacer pobre
1208486 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
1208487 discutir una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso
1208488 no hay derecho a que de repente por las propias condiciones de un modelo econ mico social y pol tico esos que crecen y que pueden tener m s riqueza vean que dando un poquito ayudan a los que solitos no pueden salir de la pobreza
1208489 sue o con un pa s en el que todos tengan derecho a la educaci n la salud y la vivienda falta mucho pero hemos construido una realidad que muchos no cre an posible es cierto que no todos somos iguales pero lo que tenemos que garantizarles a todos es la igualdad de oportunidades
1208490 todas la luchas que se han dado son las luchas de las ideas y no de los intereses econ micos
1208491 tengo la mano tendida aun para aquellos que todav a no creen tal vez porque no entienden o porque se desconf a de lo que no se conoce por eso quiero comprometerme en este d a tan especial a poner todo de mi todo mi esfuerzo en olvidarme de los que ofendan y agravian quiero decirles a todos que mi obligaci n como presidenta no es acordarme de los que agravian sino de los que le tienden la mano al otro para construir un pa s mejor esos son los argentinos que todos necesitamos
1208492 es preciso dar la batalla por los necesitados a pesar de las conspiraciones la oligarqu a y la guerra medi tica
1208493 no tengo dudas que tienen una gran presidenta como tuvieron a un gran presidente por n stor kirchner
1208494 el desaf o tenemos que resolverlo antes de irnos como generaci n es nuestra batalla cueste lo que nos cueste estamos obligados a dejarles a nuestros hijos una patria verdadera y grande creo que vamos por el camino podemos ser optimistas

1208497 wir haben nach der langen wartezeit ohnehin nicht mehr mit dem geld gerechnet und m ssen uns halt nach der decke strecken
1208498 somit tr gt das unikum wenn schon nichts zur huldigung des landeshauptmannes so doch ein wenig zur budgetkonsolidierung des landes bei

1208500 es ist nach kurzer zeit eines der bestlaufenden h user in wien graz passt gut in unser konzept deshalb haben wir uns zu diesem schritt entschlossen
1208501 nach dem wettbewerb der von der stadtbaudirektion abgewickelt wird soll der sieger m glichst schnell mit der detailplanung beauftragt werden unser ziel ist dass die baubewilligung bis oktober n chsten jahres vorliegt
1208502 der mittelstand strebt auf es wird viel gebaut das ist eine chance auch f r k rntner nischenprodukte und zwischenfertigungsstufen
1208503 we interviewed him here friday and the story changed enough to where there was a murder one charge made
1208504 its hard to call it an accident i cant talk about his intent but i dont think he intended he just lost his temper
1208505 its a tragedy for the whole community for something like this to take place
1208506 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
1208507 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
1208508 but this is a considerable distance to where the others were found in canadian waters
1208509 and one that was found was a hoax so we want to be certain
1208510 what it was is a sock inside the shoe that appeared to contain decomposed flesh
1208511 we dont know at this point whether thats animal whether its human or what it is
1208512 she could see sand in the shoe and when she removed the sock she could tell there were bones and probably decomposing flesh
1208513 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan

1208518 this court ruling is a huge victory for the communities of appalachia that have suffered for far too long from the devastating effects of mountaintop removal mining
1208519 if it stands i think it will have major repercussions throughout the region
1208520 to ensure that penn virginia operating company llc mountain forest products inc or any other entity acting in concert with them cease removing vegetation clear cutting timber and constructing or improving roadways or conducting any other surface coal mining operations on the property
1208521 mountain forest products has no interest in the proposed surface mine and has no involvement with a amp g concerning the mine
1208522 mountain forest products intends to cut and remove the timber whether or not a surface mine permit is issued to a amp g
1208523 pvoc and its predecessors have engaged in the commercial sale of timber in southwest virginia for more than 100 years
1208524 the relief sought if granted would deprive pvoc of the income from this use of its property and affect pvocs ability to contract for the harvesting of its timber elsewhere on its property where future coal mining may take place
1208525 i find that the plaintiffs have made a clear showing of great risk of irreparable harm that is neither remote nor speculative but actual and imminent
1208526 i find that the plaintiffs have raised serious questions going to the merits of the case to justify more deliberate investigation
1208527 this deals with the health and safety of our students
1208528 six thousand young people die each year in automobile accidents
1208529 lets go youre here im here lets debate the issues
1208530 roe went over the pamphlet point by point tearing down davis accusation
1208531 then he called davis out he challenged him to a debate right then and there
1208532 it blew me away i guess he was both scared and mad davis ignored the challenge but he got feisty too a few minutes later he was ushered away and into a car
1208533 i guess you live and learn he got up and left me the people and the pig
1208534 davis said roe was lying by saying he davis had pocketed money from pacs and special interests
1208535 roe pretty much told him the way i grew up when somebody calls you a liar you go out back and settle it
1208536 he may have been there and he may have got up and talked but he did not address the issues
1208537 and ive never been called a liar in my life
1208538 he called the person a liar and told him one time to shut your mouth
1208539 inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
1208540 to be included in the national league of cities its a tremendous honor just to be a finalist
1208541 it speaks volumes for the individuals whove been players in the optinet program from the beginning
1208542 because of the criteria a lot of different types of things are submitted
1208543 because of the large number of submissions the judges have only seen a portion of them so far to identify the top nominations
1208544 usually a few entries are clearly the top and the debate focuses on them
1208545 it may not be very popular but we wouldnt be doing our job as a board if we dont look at this
1208546 weve done quite a bit of work but it was dropped because other things were more important
1208547 its not any one persons fault but we cant put this off
1208548 theres no rush we just need to get this done before next year
1208549 theres really not that many kids affected but were under loaded at some schools and overloaded at others
1208550 our other big concern is our fuel we have too few students riding some buses
1208551 theyve done an outstanding job especially when you consider the exposure a school system has with buses and children and other vehicles
1208552 this is unprecedented i dont think it has ever happened at wrigley
1208553 i look at the church like the disciples that were in the boat when jesus came to them on the water peter represents the young people today they want to jump out of the boat and show the world what they can do with jesus they want to do some bold stuff
1208554 im not getting out of the boat and p were shocked by the blindness in jesse jacksons survivor mentality could it be thats how many gen yers perceive us
1208555 i think we both recognize the same symptom a shallow spiritual and
1208556 it isnt a question of whether our young people are connecting online it is only a question of who they are connecting with
1208557 i also feel the tension in our society right now as we shift from tv to web
1208558 we missed it we were too comfortable to get up and go with god and who knows how many were lost
1208559 its insulting and demeaning when an older generation points at a younger and says your life experience is wrong
1208560 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
1208561 who they are in christ what they can do in jesuss name and what jesus can do through them
1208562 i dont think everybodys getting asthma from air fresheners and house cleaners but this suggests that more research needs to be done
1208563 suggests that other people should probably avoid them especially considering the way we live in our homes today tightly wrapped inside so that if there are any chemicals present were constantly breathing them in
1208564 companies that work with animals should have policies and practices in place to insure they are treated humanely at all points of the production cycle
1208565 we need an ethical stamp of approval on nutritious plant foods organic beans whole grains veggie burgers and more that dont take the lives of innocent animals that arent the worst dietary contributors to global warming the worst polluters and resource drainers and the most scientifically incriminated dietary risk factors of the nations deadliest diseases
1208566 this is especially important at a time when israel faces the worst drought in history and a 2007 israel union for environmental defense report projects that global warming will cause severe heat waves and storms up to 30 percent less rainfall and severe flooding from a rising mediterranean sea
1208567 hekhsher tzedek reminds us that kosher is not just about rituals
1208568 kosher gives me the sense that its a respectful process
1208569 its respecting the life of the animal as well as the worker when this situation came up it felt very uncomfortable my daughter who is a vegetarian thinks the way to avoid all of this is to become a vegetarian it is so hard to make decisions about what is moral or ethical
1208570 its a way to be conscious of who you are and that theres a god every time you eat and to make a separation between the profane and the holy
1208571 there are few enough kosher meat producers as it is
1208572 we need that company i hope i am eventually going to be able to buy their product without feeling remorse ill probably be buying less and watching closely
1208573 these issues if they were a problem at some point are all being addressed
1208574 this is an example of the conservative movement at its best
1208575 its adhering to an ancient tradition and at the same time living with ethics and sensitivity to other people
1208576 my belief is more people will buy kosher products with hekhsher tzedek because it speaks to their value system on multiple levels
1208577 its an insult to all the religious people and the orthodox people and all the people who have the highest standards
1208578 its saying they dont care about the workers and the animals this assumes the orthodox people who give hekhshers have not been doing that
1208579 companies that deal in religiously sanctioned food items should also follow an outline that is reflective of jewish law in relationship with their employees that has to be carefully structured
1208580 to me having an ethical endorsement would matter as much as the more traditional kosher certification
1208581 its a way to be conscious of who you are and that theres a god every time you eat and to make a separation between the profane and the holy
1208582 there are few enough kosher meat producers as it is
1208583 we need that company i hope i am eventually going to be able to buy their product without feeling remorse ill probably be buying less and watching closely

1208591 to me having an ethical endorsement would matter as much as the more traditional kosher certification
1208592 transparency and a willingness to enter into dialogue with the united synagogue for conservative judaism the rabbinical assembly and their partners will therefore be essential for a companys products to qualify for the hekhsher tzedek
1208593 the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see
1208594 driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10
1208595 i was very sad and i felt like i was a slave
1208596 most of the clients we interviewed did not even know what a social security number was or what purpose it served
1208597 this worker simply had the papers filled out for him at the plant since he could not read or write spanish let alone english
1208598 let me go on record saying that i have never ever given her any advice on what to wear to put the record straight i think that michelle obama does not need advice
1208599 to me nelly is the quintessential definition of the sean john man
1208600 he has the attitude the swagger and most of all the physique that our customers can both aspire and relate to and lets be honest all of the ladies out there are going to be thanking us for this campaign the images are so strong they speak for themselves
1208601 considering the challenging real estate market it is critical for builders and developers to implement marketing and public relations strategies that will result in the best roi attract quality prospects and convert prospects into buyers
1208602 the mountain estates online campaign combines the best online public relations branding and sem strategies to deliver the most targeted exposure for the best value
1208603 the mountain estates public relations and marketing strategy includes local online media outlets and real estate related search engine strategies including optimized press releases a newsroom blog pay per click advertising campaign and a variety of other interactive digital strategies involving video email and select print media
1208604 everything is tracked through google analytics so we can measure the return on investment and cost per lead
1208605 the statistics from this study confirm what has widely been known not only is a degree critical to getting a job but it is also key to advancing in ones career
1208606 and given the current economic climate a degree might be needed just to keep your job
1208607 the message is loud and clear that in todays competitive job market if you dont have the right education others will pass you by
1208608 we found that 22 of people who started college but didnt finish have been denied a job raise or a promotion what is shocking is that workers are telling us that not having a degree is becoming a significant roadblock in their careers
1208609 in three days really in one my mind became full of an eternal silence
1208610 one can but pass it by or else accept it as having some amount of evidential weight
1208611 but many are growing increasingly frustrated with their lack of payback on innovation spending and some firms are apparently starting to think twice this could have major implications for corporate competitiveness
1208612 for most firms the problem of disappointing returns is fixable but it demands a sustained and concerted effort as well as an understanding of what to focus on which many companies seem to lack its something they desperately need to develop
1208613 with competitive pressures rising globally now is precisely the wrong time for companies to be shying away from spending on innovation if that is indeed what were seeing
1208614 instead companies should be redoubling their efforts innovation is one of the few perhaps the only means of generating sustainable competitive advantage companies need to recognize that and structure their priorities and activities accordingly
1208615 at a time when data center energy demand is accelerating we are significantly reducing energy usage and impact on the utility grid at the mcclellan park facility
1208616 we will continue to design environmentally responsible data centers and consider leed as a baseline for our facilities going forward
1208617 the reduction in energy usage significantly reduces the facilitys carbon footprint and impact on the utility grid
1208618 the energy use of the adc data center meets a recently considered impossible to achieve pue of 1 1 with an energy savings of 1 million to 2 million per year this project stands to be the largest energy savings achieved ever in sacramento and indeed the rest of california
1208619 adc has taken a leadership role in designing one of the countrys lowest energy data centers this is the key component of the leed platinum certification and more importantly in making this facility the lowest carbon emitting data center of its kind in california
1208620 adc is joining our growing roster of green businesses at mcclellan park as one of the largest redevelopment projects in northern california mcclellan park is one of the leading recyclers of buildings and rather than sending the waste to the landfill we reuse concrete and asphalt from our demolition projects we are also cleaning and recycling contaminated land and have attracted numerous businesses that are involved in green activities mcclellan park is the epicenter of green development in the sacramento region and is actively seeking environmentally conscious tenants our tenants include solar manufacturing hybrid automobile battery testing and repair paint recycling and soon will include some of the areas greenest buildings like adc
1208621 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues big willy unleashed was designed by a wii developer specifically for the wii when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled
1208622 i started the ico project ueda san joined my team in japan as a cinematic animator but he created a short movie and presented it to me and said i want to make this game i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game we have to have experienced people do it so it took a while recruiting one person at a time and because fumito ueda doesnt compromise we had to move the development from psone to playstation 2 then i couldnt complete the game because i moved to the united states

1208637 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1208638 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1208639 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1208640 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1208641 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1208642 die entscheidung einen investor zu gewinnen sollte wohl berlegt sein
1208643 der versuch die nutzer mit werbung zu nerven kann nur schief gehen
1208644 diese community vermarktung werden wir ganz stark ausbauen das hat mit klassischer werbung wenig zu tun auf studivz gibt es zum beispiel eine gruppe mit 90 000 nutzern die gerne billig markenprodukte kaufen wollen dort l sst sich online marketing leicht ansetzen denn das nutzerinteresse deckt sich exakt mit dem angebot diese mitglieder empfehlen sich gegenseitig wo es die besten schn ppchen gibt das geht in die richtung social shopping

1208647 die unterschiede lassen sich durch die spezifische wirtschafts und unternehmensstruktur erkl ren
1208648 glaubten vor vielen jahren gesch ftsf hrer noch quasi unantastbar zu sein so mussten sie feststellen dass dies bei weitem nicht so ist

1208651 einwanderung und integration ist ein prozess oft dauert es mehrere
1208652 wir hatten eine durchgehend hohe beteiligung und dabei neben den herausragenden siegern auch sehr viele weitere teams die sich am markt behaupten werden

1208655 so yeah i wrote this to answer the question and hopefully to refresh your mind fellow tweeters and bring back those sweet memories in twitterverse
1208656 its like a villanelle this inclination of going back to events in our past the way the villanelles form refuses to move forward in linear development circling instead at those familiar moments of emotion only the rereading counts nabokov said
1208657 the basis for the new accusations some of which were classified was not disclosed at the hearing tribunal members acknowledged they were just as confused as the detainees about the origin of some of the allegations
1208658 at this point we dont know why you are being accused of being a member of the xxx group
1208659 do you have any idea why you are being connected with this group
1208660 ive been here for three years and these accusations were just told to me
1208661 one detainee was judged a threat in part because he was a karate expert and had taught martial arts to xxxian orphans tribunal records show he was also classified as potentially dangerous because he was familiar with computers another detainee was flagged because he had performed mandatory service in the yyyian army more than a decade ago as a cook
1208662 a photolog of new york with an emphasis on urban decay strange signage and general weirdness
1208663 it started out great kissing and everything but then he started going at it like a drill hammer then all the sudden i realized
1208664 so im sleeping with this guy last week just met him and hes bad
1208665 yeah well at least its just some guy and not your husband
1208666 my friends so over her husband that she cant even look at him anymore when they have sex she has to do it doggystyle that way she doesnt have to see his face she just buries her face in the pillow sad thing is he thinks hes being wild
1208667 yeah she says she was over the sex years ago she says she especially hates his sex face
1208668 thats when you really know its over when you cant stand their sex face
1208669 if we could relaunch scion i wouldnt ever have called it a youth brand because its a kiss of death
1208670 porque es una obra de arte pero obviamos su simbolog a porque nuestro inter s es rescatar nuestra cultura ind gena
1208671 esta es la primera vez que una red social a escala planetaria ha logrado validar la teor a de los seis grados de separaci n
1208672 we believe this rule which will require the use of lead safe work practice standards by contractors is the capstone of epas regulatory efforts to further protect children from exposure to lead based paint
1208673 there will be disincentives to hire a trained professional because it will cost more
1208674 the rule ultimately will not be effective because it will drive homeowners into the black market
1208675 during my experience the policy people in the administration are all part of the same administration and dont like to air a public policy dispute
1208676 our experience has consistently shown that our customers seek out the bags with the most berries still attached to the stem
1208677 unacceptable to many customers and families who want their grapes to be fresh
1208678 this proposed allowance recognizes the reality that even the most pristine bunch of grapes has some amount of healthy and sound berries that are not attached to the stem
1208679 to unfairly profile berries without defect would deteriorate grading standards
1208680 too high and would not appropriately reflect what is expected by industry and consumers in a u s no 1 table grape
1208681 would weaken the standard and reduce consumer confidence in the grade
1208682 the retailer used to have to figure out what to do with them
1208683 now the consumer takes them home and decides what to do with them
1208684 this translates into additional revenue at retail and it is reasonable for growers to look for a share of this new income source
1208685 i cant imagine consumers would want what this will bring
1208686 y antes de conocer el significado de headbanging mi cabeza ya se agitaba sola cada vez que escuchaba esta canci n sonaba tan arrecho una guitarra densa y a la vez mel dica la bater a y el bajo a toda furia y la voz brutal compuesta inicialmente por los hermanos
1208687 bastante discretos con lo que no ganaron mucha popularidad glaze fue despedido por diferencias musicales y en su lugar entra
1208688 en vivo creo que en donington sin conocer nada sobre esta banda co o supe que ese carajo con esa voz tan arrecha no era el mismo tipo con voz carrasposa del disco que hab a escuchado antes por lo que emprend mi b squeda de informaci n resulta que en 1975
1208689 quien pasar a a ser la insignia de iron maiden
1208690 un lbum bien rockanrollero que iba contra las corrientes punk existentes en ese entonces
1208691 quien ya no contaba con dennis stratton siendo reemplazado por
1208692 alcanzando una popularidad incre ble gracias a que el p blico admiraba al reemplazo de dianno por su potente voz y su gran carisma luego de culminar las giras de este album clive burr es reemplazado por
1208693 siendo ste uno de las m s exitosas creaciones de la doncella tiempo despu s adrian smith decide ocuparse de proyectos personales por lo cual amistosamente decide retirarse de maiden dando paso al en rgico
1208694 bruce dickinson se retira de iron maiden ocasionando as grandes inc gnitas alrededor de la banda y de los mismos seguidores considerando incluso el fin de la agrupaci n debido a lo dif cil que ser a encontrar otro vocalista que cumpliera tanto como lo hac a bruce
1208695 que si bien no fueron lbumes tan exitosos y con clara diferencia a sus anteriores producciones el p blico ofreci apoyo total en los conciertos alrededor del mundo
1208696 contando con las canciones mas representatives de la banda hasta el momento
1208697 con caracter sticas heavy metaleras m s t cnicas que en discos previos
1208698 que contiene los singles m s exitosos de la doncella
1208699 sin duda alguna que iron maiden es considerada una de las bandas mas influyentes de la escena metalera siendo respetados a nivel mundial y siempre contando con el apoyo de sus fieles seguidores
1208700 y tan s lo al escuchar la primera canci n que le daba nombre al disco comprend porque hetfield y cia los idolatraban
1208701 a pesar de esto lemmy sigui adelante a pesar de que sus compa eros desistieran sin embargo ingresaron
1208702 en 1977 demostrando un rocknroll ruidoso y sucio en la portada de este disco se muestra al legendario
1208703 fue a cargo de eddie clarke lo cual no cumpli las expectativas que ten a la banda posteriormente eddie dejar a el grupo por algunas diferencias con mr kilmister siendo reemplazado por
1208704 robertson a pesar de ser un excelente guitarrista no encaj en el grupo debido a sus fuertes adicciones y sus problem ticas a tocar algunas de las canciones m s emblem ticas de la banda luego de varias audiciones
1208705 lbum cargado de un puro sonido rockero altamente influenciado por el naciente thrash metal de la poca
1208706 que por el poco tiempo disponible no fue un lbum mejor que sus antecesores la banda se mantiene de gira teniendo de compa eros a otros grandes artistas como y
1208707 que es otro triunfo de la banda cosechando las mejores cr ticas con un buen contenido de temas geniales despu s de las extenuantes giras taylor se mostr poco motivado para un nuevo disco por lo que fue expulsado ingresando en la bater a
1208708 que no fue el mejor disco de motorhead con temas sin la vitalidad de discos anteriores debido al bajo rendimiento de alridge ingresa
1208709 hasta que wurzel decide abandonar la banda para dedicarse a su familia
1208710 con lo que demuestran que su potencia musical se mantiene intacta
1208711 que no es ning n desperdicio sino mas bien otra de sus grandes producciones
1208712 que despu s de mas de 30 a os de carrera art stica sigue rockeando sin que el calendario los afecte
1208713 demostrando que hay mot rhead para rato una banda nica que ha resistido el paso del tiempo de conflictos internos que ha deca do y ha sabido resurgir a base del gran rocknroll que siempre ha ofrecido los grandes motorhead totalmente una leyenda
1208714 no fat zero carbs and 97 calories per 1 5 ounce serving
1208715 we must avoid creating the misleading impression that the dietary guidelines condone the consumption of one or two alcohol beverages per day for those who should not consume alcohol at all
1208716 mandating standardized information about the alcohol content as part of the serving facts panel
1208717 this is about marketing advantages to sell their product if the public believes having a beer is the same as having a martini we are in big trouble
1208718 to know how much alcohol is in a serving gives everyone a point of comparison
1208719 this attack using patents is using a different mechanism to achieve monopoly pricing
1208720 the scope of the problem has grown and we are losing double digits in sales to copycats
1208721 months of work go into designing fenders these guys are designers not engineers
1208722 there have been more parts of better quality every year and then ford comes up with this strategy and its a chilling strategy
1208723 if i beat a fender out in my own back yard would ford consider that infringement
1208724 there is nothing original about these parts a headlight is a headlight
1208725 ready willing and able to supply the countrys needs for replacement parts
1208726 do not indulge in price gouging and would not do so
1208727 would commandeer the social security tax system for immigration enforcement purposes
1208728 its not our intent to make it harder for people to take leave
1208729 these are regulations that will make it harder to take advantage of the law
1208730 you will end up having more people not protected by the law
1208731 lead is not the only dangerous chemical found in toys
1208732 the widespread use of vinyl plastic in toys exposes millions of children to additional toxic metals and additives such as phthalates
1208733 americans want to know the place of origin of their wines
1208734 for every line you add to the label you can add 5
1208735 tires will become a pariah if they are classified as a solid waste
1208736 this regulatory change doesnt just affect end users but the whole industry structure
1208737 had congress intended to exempt all units that combust waste for the purpose of recovering thermal energy it could likewise have expressly provided for their exemption in the statute
1208738 nobody has been ruled in or out at this point
1208739 if they burn tires they have to meet emission standards
1208740 its not our goal to crack down on them just to get a better environmental result
1208741 if its 10 percent of the fuel they use and its millions of dollars for more controls mills will say its just easier to switch fuels
1208742 were interested in converting the rubber into more beneficial uses
1208743 were just trying to figure out how this affects our business
1208744 by requiring only a limited subset of anticipated new reactors less than half of the currently announced plants to address aircraft impacts as part of the design the nrcs proposed rule could undermine public confidence in new nuclear power plants
1208745 we dont have to do it but our customers would have had questions from the public on why that plant wont withstand an airplane crash
1208746 this proposed rule is not necessary for adequate protection but rather is an enhancement that will result in newly designed facilities being more inherently robust against aircraft impacts than the facilities not subject to this proposed rule
1208747 we are competing directly with the people who make ethanol and they are outbidding us for corn
1208748 there is just no bigger kitchen table issue for either party when americans have to think twice about buying a dozen eggs
1208749 my request is for a waiver of 50 percent of the mandate for the production of ethanol derived from grain
1208750 we have 100 percent natural chickens as defined by usda
1208751 but it shouldnt be labeled all natural if you inject it with a solution
1208752 if the federal agencies themselves cannot agree on the law what hope is there that banks can resolve these confounding legal issues
1208753 this is an issue that there is so much interest in that we dont want to rush
1208754 its a very smart and kind of shady attempt to try and regulate themselves
1208755 its the strongest and best metrics in the produce industry we are trying to give consumers what they deserve
1208756 encourages all efforts at reducing the risk of pathogenic contamination during the production and handling of leafy greens
1208757 we dont believe a marketing act program is a very good way to govern on farm practices
1208758 to have national rules on how my farm grows chard is problematic

1208767 we want to believe we can cure cancer throw a lot of money at it and solve the problem
1208768 it hasnt worked because we want to kill the disease but dont look at what causes it

1208770 we have been waiting almost 40 years for an upgrade said jacqueline gillan vice president of advocates for highway and auto safety a washington based nonprofit organization
1208771 now its five years later and they couldnt come up with a better rule than this
1208772 is rulemaking and its progeny guidance an extension of the legislative process or can the president manage but not direct it
1208773 kerwin director of the universitys center for the study of rulemaking said of the bush executive order
1208774 its good news that the senate dropped the effort to block interagency review of guidance documents
1208775 i am concerned the order shifts power to political operatives and how they can kill or change regulations based on political considerations entirely in secret
1208776 the big thing we saw was the amount of discretionary reviews done by agencies and little awareness of them
1208777 its about implementation not what am i trying to achieve
1208778 the report found that reviews are most often prompted by petitions from industry groups which cite financial burdens or structural market or technology changes in their fields
1208779 a non newtonian fluid that changes from a liquid state to a solid state when stress is applied ie shaking of the metal sheet with sound waves
1208780 dead monster washes ashore in montauk our guess is that its the trailer and first episodes at underwired each weekday until the trailer looks ok

1208782 and one that was found was a hoax so we want to be certain
1208783 what it was is a sock inside the shoe that appeared to contain decomposed flesh
1208784 we dont know at this point whether thats animal whether its human or what it is
1208785 she could see sand in the shoe and when she removed the sock she could tell there were bones and probably decomposing flesh

1208793 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
1208794 we have learnt a little late no doubt that for states as for individuals real wealth consists not in acquiring or invading the domains of others but in developing ones own
1208795 our social personality is the creation of the minds of others
1208796 things can happen anywhere but right next to my house thats very scary because of my children

1208799 six flags is expanding as an entertainment company by identifying new revenue streams while simultaneously revitalizing its core business this has been the fundamental objective of our turnaround plan our momentum through july indicates that the strategy is taking hold with long term value being the endgame
1208800 i dont know anything about those reports and even if i did its not something we could comment about
1208801 we decided to improve the display so that visitors spend more time to learn the horror of the bombing
1208802 to me and to many of the survivors this museum has become way too clean and pretty and not shocking
1208803 when this museum was opened in 1955 it was much more shocking and it has been gradually cleaned up and made more like a professional museum
1208804 when you go through here you should be shocked you should be frightened
1208805 as i get older i feel more strongly that we have to hand down our experiences to the next generation the message that war is horrible
1208806 on the day of the bombing my father immediately went to the centre of the city to save and search for people but he didnt say a word about it before he died in 1988
1208807 they were trudging toward us some putting bandages on some using crutches some stopped walking and fell down they were like ghosts it was a cruel scene that i will never be able to forget my whole life
1208808 i was too scared to talk about it but that scene keeps haunting me throughout my life
1208809 we believe rock n roll is a revolution designed to move people out of their comfort zone there is no greater revolution than to change the world for jesus christ

1208816 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1208817 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer
1208818 this news today im sure will overcome that problem virtually entirely

1208835 ahora con respecto al paro de camioneros hasta hoy lunes ayer no ha pasado nada es decir ha habido abastecimiento del cereal con destino al consumo interno
1208836 el problema es que si en diez d as no se soluciona nada podr an presentarse inconvenientes en el abastecimiento
1208837 no vemos soluci n alguna a menos de la concertaci n entre el gobierno y los transportadores

1208845 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1208846 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1208847 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1208848 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1208849 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1208850 se trata de la construcci n de departamentos de 30 a 40 pisos en distritos como miraflores y barranco cuya construcci n requiere de experiencia de empresas grandes
1208851 the big deal this year was the i 5 project
1208852 normally we have the luxury of scheduling this work without considering a major project like that in the area
1208853 definitely the relationships ive formed with the students i feel like my mentees big sister

1208855 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission mr bartlett said
1208856 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation

1208875 theres a sort of subtle insinuation that sick people should crawl back into their caves and stay there till they either die or get better but when you hear the edwardss discuss the idea that her cancer is now incurable that its not something she will get better from and so not something where they can hit pause wait for it to pass and then resume their lives you have to think that the question theyre asking themselves is not how can elizabeth best get well but how would they like to spend the rest of their years and knowing her even casually im not surprised to learn the answer is fighting

1208877 our suicide prevention coordinators are identifying about 1 000 suicide attempts per month among the veterans we see is this something we should address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it

1208908 this has forever been a national party seat since it was formed so were not kidding ourselves on that front
1208909 the electricity privatisation will be hot to trot we are one of the headquarters for country energy

1208948 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1208949 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1208950 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1208951 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement
1208952 cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1208953 it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1208954 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1208955 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle
1208956 john buchanan is very keen to develop the overall depth in his squad and sees a pre season camp here in brisbane as a good way to realise that goal
1208957 while their big name international recruits are all likely to be tied up with their respective countrys touring commitments they will use the camp to involve as many of their contracted and targeted players as they can

1208973 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1208974 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1208975 and some of those tactics very frankly you mention the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
1208976 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind

1208978 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and were talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
1208979 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem

1208983 due to various complicated reasons and my personal choice to follow my academic studies i can no longer be a wastefall member i want to thank all my bandmates fans claus and lars from intromental ken at sensory and olivier at replica for all the great times concerning music all i have to say is that im going to continue writing music in a very different style though and not with the perspective of releasing something soon it was a great journey i will always remember i hope that other bands will be influenced by our passion so far and mark their way in the rotten music business dom chris nick kostis love respect good luck and apologies

1209000 an extra 10 pounds of muscle will therefore burn approximately 350 to 500 extra calories per day or over 3 500 per week in order to lose one pound of fat you must burn an extra 3 500 calories this means that if you increase the amount of muscle mass in your body by 10 pounds you will lose a pound of fat every seven to 10 days without making any other changes
1209001 lets compare two 150 pound people although they weigh exactly the same person b has 10 more pounds of muscle mass than person a that means that person b can eat an extra 350 to 500 calories per day without gaining any weight
1209002 oh its okay i boosted my metabolism by 500 calories because i gained 10 pounds of muscle an extra scoop oh sure why not ill just gain another pound 10 pounds and then i can have an extra 1000 calories per day
1209003 he has told us he murdered her on saturday night left her body in the bath and went to a party on saturday night before decapitating her the following day
1209004 the murder was premeditated he turned the music up on the stereo moments before the crime so neighbours wouldnt hear her screaming
1209005 i know im a monster for doing it i was just so desperate to get that body out
1209006 consumers want a quality internet experience that requires a combination of industry investment innovation and self governance along with appropriate government oversight to shine the light on any potential problems with individual practices or providers
1209007 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
1209008 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
1209009 i hope it never comes true but i believe it is only a matter of time before there is a catastrophic event

1209013 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1209014 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result
1209015 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1209016 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1209017 first kaunas are a decent team and secondly they are in their season while were not started yet but we have got to overcome any problems were having at the present moment if we are going to go through
1209018 i think everybody from kaunas felt that the scoreline in the first leg was a great result for us
1209019 it gives us a big chance and we feel that we can cause a surprise if we get some luck and play well but if we want to win the game we will need to play even better than we did in glasgow
1209020 it is still going to be very difficult despite getting a 0 0 draw at ibrox because rangers are a great club with a great team i thought that before we played the first match our chances of progressing to the next round were 50 50 now having had 90 minutes i still feel the percentage is the same
1209021 he made a lot of fast runs and miller is also dangerous but for me novo is the player that i really liked when he came into the game after half time in glasgow we started to have more problems very quickly he became quite dangerous his style is very positive
1209022 i think he will be a very important player for us to watch and my feeling is that he will play the match from the start
1209023 the pressure will be on rangers to win and they were not as scary as advertised in glasgow
1209024 now we are at home we can be calm and composed
1209025 rangers had more chances in the first game but that is logical as they were at home in front of their own fans other than that we managed to control the game apart from the final 20 minutes i think we deserved our result
1209026 he has an appalling set of antecedents and he admits he has wasted his life

1209041 i believe its important that we dont just recognize our own talents but we acknowledge the role other people have in helping us discover them for ourselves my dad taught me that it was important to have the courage to be yourself no matter what
1209042 there are no kids that shouldnt have someone saying to them like my teacher said to me i believe in you
1209043 inspiration belief in yourself someone believing in you it all makes the biggest difference

1209273 cada d a recibimos dos o tres llamadas para este pr ximo fin de semana pero es imposible atenderlas porque tenemos el hostal casi lleno desde principio de a o
1209274 porque excepto alg n d a concreto tenemos pr cticamente lleno toda la semana
1209275 casi cada d a tenemos que rechazar peticiones para el 9 porque como el inicio de las fiestas cae en s bado es el d a clave
1209276 y de all en adelante a n nos quedan habitaciones libres
1209277 al caer en s bado el inicio de las fiestas se ha concentrado toda la ocupaci n el primer fin de semana pero ha perjudicado al resto de la semana
1209278 el 9 y el 10 estamos al 100 el d a 11 bajamos al 70 80 y de all en adelante ya hablaremos aunque afortunadamente contamos con muchos clientes fijos por trabajo
1209279 lo que s hemos notado este a o es que ha bajado mucho el turismo extranjero
1209280 aunque este a o se est n mezclando tambi n con los de la expo porque el campin de zaragoza tambi n est a tope
1209281 que este a o se ha multiplicado el n mero de clientes franceses
1209282 no hay semana que no lleguen turistas al pueblo y se queden a dormir
1209283 los usuarios no se atreven a pasar porque en el ltimo tramo con curva la oscuridad es total

1209285 she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself

1209340 although the construction sector started the year on a favourable note the latest data shows that it is undeniably starting to suffer from the tougher market conditions
1209341 purchasing managers reported that inflationary pressures and a drop in the demand for new orders were the biggest contributing factors

1209446 see above over compensation for small penis can also occur and should be discouraged teach self acceptance
1209447 this stool does not like arts and crafts unless its pottery and unchained melody is playing under these circumstances keep stool away from melissa
1209448 stools should not under any circumstances be used as shoes if you do this you are stupid horribly horribly stupid but obviously there were stupid people who came before you hence the warning picture idiots
1209449 this is what i hope happens to people who use stools as shoes freaks

1209454 bahaya yang sebenarnya tersembunyi pada system islam kemampuannya untuk menyebar dan vitalitasnya
1209455 bila umat islam bersatu di bawah satu pemerintahan mereka bisa menjadi malapetaka bagi dunia
1209456 meskipun sudah banyak uang yang dihamburkan dan tenaga yang dicurahkan namun tidak seorang pun ummat islam yang masuk kristen
1209457 tujuan kita bukan mengkristenkan umat islam ini tidak akan sanggup kita laksanakan

1209460 sejak remaja aku sudah mencurahkan tenaga baik dengan lisan maupun tulisan untuk memalingkan hati umat islam agar mengabdi dengan ikhlas kepada pemerintahan inggris aku menyerukan untuk menghapus ide jihad yang diyakini oleh sementara orang bodoh dan hal inilah yang menghalangi mereka untuk menerima kekuasaan asing tersebut

1209463 therell always be competition for places at a top club like liverpool but it doesnt worry me it can be difficult at times but i think it brings the best out of everyone
1209464 each striker has their own different attributes and the fact we can all play alongside each other can only be beneficial to the club but ive got enough confidence in my ability so its a challenge im looking forward to
1209465 when a new striker is brought in theres always going be speculation that another one will have to make way its inevitable but i no longer take any notice of it ive spoke to the manager and hes reassured me that im in his plans
1209466 well have to see what happens but hopefully ill have a big part to play this season
1209467 hi fellas give me one short black espresso straight up

1209469 hey tim ive heard freezing coffee produces a better tasting drink and a superior aroma
1209470 hey dont bite my head off im just telling you what i read in the paper
1209471 you freeze coffee and you run the risk of it going stale
1209472 if this continues on i may not need to go upstairs and work out
1209473 listen you know and i know that freezing will significantly slow oxidation where as leaving coffee at room temperature will dilute the co2
1209474 where did you hear that you know you jump onto every new fad that comes along
1209475 its not a fad believe me youll get a better tasting coffee if you put them in the freezer you should listen to the real experts
1209476 just use commonsense youve got to make sure the bags are tightly sealed the coffee will stay fresh
1209477 anyway id love to stay and chat but ive got to go
1209478 my mom used to make me warm milk with a dash of coffee
1209479 hey did you guys hear sirens i had trouble hearing it
1209480 we have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain where jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf having become a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek
1209481 the metaphor of an anchor in itself effectively portrays the concept of fixity for the function of an anchor is to provide security in the face of changing tides and rising storms
1209482 inner shrine behind the curtain into which the anchor of christian hope enters is a reference to the holy of holies thanks to the perfect atonement accomplished by christ access into the heavenly sanctuary of gods eternal presence of which the earthly shrine was a shadow and a symbol heb 8 5 9 11 23 has been made open to all who by faith have laid hold of the hope that is set before us in him the entry of the ascended christ into the presence chamber of god himself the christian hope then is bound up with the realization that in entering the reality of the heavenly sanctuary jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf although he has gone before he has not deserted us for a forerunner is one who goes on ahead in order to open up the way for those who follow after jesus as our forerunner has opened up the way for gods people who formerly were excluded so that now in him they have access into the very presence of god and are encouraged to draw near with full confidence
1209483 im treating myself for shock mom i got really nauseous a few minutes ago
1209484 you have five minutes to wallow in the delicious misery enjoy it embrace it discard it and proceed
1209485 youre an artist man your job is to break barriers not accept blame and bow and say thank you im a loser ill go away now have the courage to fail big and stick around make them wonder why youre still smiling thats true greatness to me
1209486 sometimes the road ahead is paved with anything but good intentions
1209487 you go across the bridge traversing mark twains muse jeff buckleys funeral bed as the night air whips through your hair around your face and out the other window you can feel the soul of that dark water even as you arrive on the other side

1209490 god please give me the strength and tools to cross the river

1209492 i just wanted to see what your reaction would be
1209493 como se meus p s fossem feitos de mat ria vol til mais leve que o ar
1209494 the m95 fires 50 cal bmg browing machine gun ammunution which makes it the only infantry weapon that fires in game speak this means the m95 rounds punch through through fences buildings drums and other infantry cover similar to heavy machine gun fire and also capable of piercing lightly armored surface such as helicopter cockpits humvee windshields etc so when comparing the m95 vs m24 final damage to a soldier armor modifier total damage the m24 to the chest would deal 66 5 but the m95 to the chest would deal 95 being left with 5 health or 33 health is a big difference
1209495 fernando will cause lots of problems for my fellow goalkeepers next season hes a great player and im sure the liverpool fans are going to love him
1209496 the first year in a foreign country is always difficult but myself and all the other lads will be there for him every inch of the way to help him settle
1209497 scoring goals will also help him settle and i can foresee no problems with him
1209498 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1209499 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
1209500 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1209501 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
1209502 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1209503 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1209504 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
1209505 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1209506 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
1209507 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
1209508 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1209509 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
1209510 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
1209511 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
1209512 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
1209513 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break
1209514 this overtime pay provision is not new nor is it unique in fact it was included in the previous contract
1209515 oh jesus was a nice guy so ill try to be nice to everyone around me
1209516 tuvimos una largada muy buena y pudimos avanzar varios lugares pero promediando la primera vuelta el motor comenz a fallar y me dediqu a terminar la carrera en pista sin romper nada creo que fue la mejor manera de culminar este mal fin de semana que tuvimos entre la falla del cable captor y el motor de correr que se rompi el viernes seguramente probaremos en 9 de julio o la plata antes de ir a salta ya que los chicos del equipo van a hacer una modificaci n con la caja de direcci n
1209517 doesnt seem to be singing live is she lipsyncing with the cd playing in the background
1209518 its not unusual to have doubts like this since this is the first time she is singing in public no matter what she will prove herself with her vocals we will definitely not attempt lipsyncing by any means
1209519 next time she zia may have to downgrade the live voice so that kind of people cant blame
1209520 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also with him graciously give us all things

1209533 jiro memberikan ku segelas minuman aku hanya mengambilnya sementara mata ku terus menatap saking senengnya ketemu artis pujaan
1209534 tanya nya memperhatikan ku yang dari tadi anya mendiamkan gelas yang diberikannya tadi
1209535 ia mendekatkan gelasnya ke gelas ku sebelum kami berdua meneguk gelas kami
1209536 katanya memperkenalkan diri kalo itu sich gak usah dikasih ahu juga tahu tapi uluran tangannya gak mungkin aku lewatkan
1209537 aku mendesis perlahan jiro hanya tersenyum melihat reaksi ku itu
1209538 sahut ku kesal juga namun aku baru sadar kalau aku tak mengenakan pakaian seperti biasa aku memang tak pernah mengenakan pakaian saat tidur cukup dengan celana dalam tanpa bra
1209539 kata ku hilang semua kekesalan tadi habis yang mengetuk cowok seganteng ini hehehe
1209540 tanya ku begitu kembali keruang tamu ku yang kecil dengan sofa sofa ukuran mungil berwarna biru dengan salah satunya telah diduduki oleh james victor
1209541 ya itu tadi sudah yang pasti anda belum menikah dan belum punya pacar seorang pengacara dan anggota sebuah perkumpulan
1209542 gak ada cincin di tangan anda pakaian yang tidak rapi tas yang anda gunakan adalah tas yang biasa dipakai seorang pengacara berkas berkas yang anda bawa itu menguatkan analisa saya dan badge di kantung anda sepertinya itu sebuah lambang perkumpulan kalau belum punya pacar itu tebakan aja
1209543 aku menyuruh pelayan ku yang malas itu untuk membuka pintu yang kembali diketuk seseorang
1209544 jawabnya dengan nada malas sambil turun dan membuka pintu kamar ku itu
1209545 hmmm oke tapi bisa tunggu sebentar dan koq bisa begitu cepat anda menemukan dia disini
1209546 dia menelepon penerangan dan mencari alamat anda mudah kan untuk saya menyimpulkan dia akan mencari anda
1209547 james tampak kalut saat dua orang polisi yang dibawa rasyhid berjalan kearahnya
1209548 ok ok saya gak akan menghalangi anda membawa nya tapi tolong beri saya 30 menit untuk berbicara dengan klien saya
1209549 ya tapi tolong bebaskan saya saya benar benar gak bersalah
1209550 2 hari yang lalu albert mosses datang kekantor saya dan meminta saya membuatkan surat wasiat
1209551 aku langsung menyalin surat wasiat itu setelah berulang kali ia meyakinkan ku bahwa ia memang ingin menyerahkan hartanya pada ku aku mengetik ulang surat wasiat nya dan kami langsung menandatangani nya dengan salah satu staf ku sebagai saksi
1209552 ya memang semalam aku datang kerumah nya dengan pelayannya yang bernama sri malam kembang membukakan pintu aku datang atas undangan albert mosses sendiri dan bermaksud memintanya membatalkan surat wasiat untuk ku itu
1209553 ok aku pasti akan menolong anda sementara waktu tolong kooperatif dengan para petugas kepolisian
1209554 pinta james lagi tentu donk gak mungkin aku melepaskan kesempatan menolong cowok seganteng james
1209555 ya mungkin beberapa kali aku akan datang dan mungkin membawa sedikit makanan
1209556 ya boleh saja tapi saya yakin ada yang aneh dengan kasus ini
1209557 ya bisa saja kalau memang dirancang seseorang agar orang orang bodoh berfikir demikian
1209558 hubungan ku dengan inspektur rasyhid memang tak pernah baik sejak dulu
1209559 ya terserahmu lah silahkan kalau memang itu yang ingin kamu lakukan tapi sepertinya waktu mu sangat sempit untuk membela klien anda ini
1209560 jimmy ayo siapkan perlengkapan kita kita hanya memiliki sedikit waktu
1209561 jimmy yang dari tadi tiduran diatas sofa terbangun karena perintah ku aku pun bergegas menuju kamar mandi sebelum memulai aksi penyelamatan ku
1209562 tidak tidak ada baiknya kita menuju stasiun kita ke tempat james terlebih dahulu
1209563 kenapa harus naik kereta itu bisa ditempuh dengan 40 menit berkendaraan kan
1209564 karena albert mosses berfikir seperti itu dia memilih naik kereta daripada mengendarai mobil mobil mewahnya
1209565 lihat bagian ini rapih dan terbaca namun pada bagian tengahnya tulisannya jelek dan ada beberapa yang tak terbaca mungkin itu adalah tikungan rel kereta api jadi aku harus menghitung berapa banyak tikungan selama perjalanan untuk menguatkan analisa ku
1209566 aku tersenyum menatap si tua itu yang malah sibuk menggangu seorang cewek remaja seumuran ku yang duduk didepan kami
1209567 sementara jim masih sibuk dengan guyonan nya yang garing itu si cewek terlihat sedikit risih dengan apa yang dilakukan jimm
1209568 tanya ku pada si cebol itu yang sedang sibuk memegangi pipinya bekas tamparan cewek tadi
1209569 saya jimmy jimmy duff dan disebelah saya detective vein phillip
1209570 hanya semalam memang james datang kesini pintu juga dibukakan oleh pelayan itu dan tongkat yang tergeletak disana memang tongkat yang dibawa james
1209571 aku membuka pembicaraan dengan james di sebuah ruangan khusu bertemu dengan tahanan rasyhid tampaknya sudah kelewat batas dengan menempatkan james diruangan tahanan bukan diruangan tersangka
1209572 apa saja karena memang bukan aku yang melakukan pembunuhan itu
1209573 hanya ingin meyakinkan arthur agar membatalkan surat wasiatnya seperti yang diminta orang tua ku
1209574 hilang hilang begitu saja arthur meyakinkan ku untuk tak perlu mencarinya malam itu kalau dia menemukan pasti akan disimpan tapi siapa yang menyangka itu akan dijadikan alat untuk membunuh
1209575 james berkata dengan sangat meyakinkan sebelum menyedot cola yang aku bawa
1209576 ia tersenyum penuh kemenangan sambil memberikan sebuah amplop berisi foto aku memperhatikan isi foto itu sebuah jejak sidik jari dari darah milik james mungkin
1209577 aku mengajak jimm yang sekarang sibuk menganggu seorang polisi wanita muda
1209578 panggil ku lagi sebelum si pemilik nama menengok dan bergegas berlari kearah ku
1209579 kata ku mantap sebuah titik terang kasus ini sudah tercetak dikepala ku
1209580 cari semua asset dan transaksi yang dilakukan arthur setahun ini
1209581 ia membuka kata sambil berjalan mendekati ku aku mengamati keadaan sekeliling sepertinya masih disalah satu kandang di rumahnya sendiri
1209582 katanya memuji tapi tak enak dipuji dalam keadaan seperti ini
1209583 si albert malah terkekeh kekeh dnegan hal menjijikan yang dilakukannya
1209584 nada suaranya seperti orang yang kecewa kumis hitler nya bergerak gerak namun juga ada sedikit rasa kagum dalam nada bicaranya itu
1209585 mudah buat apa membunuh orang demi warisan yang toch akan diwarisinya juga
1209586 sidik jari itu mudah dibuat terlebih semalam dia meminta tolong pada james untuk merekatkan amplop dimana bagian lem dari amplop itu akan memberikan cetakan sidik jari james tinggal berikan sedikit darah milik tuan albert di bekas itu dan cetaklah di dinding sepertinya dia terancam dengan kedatangan ku sehingga mebuat kesalahan seperti ini untuk secepatnya menutup kasus ini

1209591 we train him when we are on duty we find some time when it is slow to train
1209592 paris is great on tv and bosses over here have been keen to snap her up for ages
1209593 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1209594 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1209595 as you think about the presidential race and how you are going to vote do you find yourself focusing more on what kind of president you think barack obama would be or more on what kind of president john mccain would be
1209596 when it comes to your vote for your chosen candidate would you say that you are excited to be voting for him you are satisfied to be voting for him or you are voting for him as the lesser of two evils
1209597 in order to win this election obamas challenge seems less that he needs to overcome john mccain rather he needs to overcome doubts voters have about himself this election is clearly more about barack obama than it is either about john mccain or even president bush
1209598 a year ago the board and investors made it very clear they felt that green design was the right direction for the corporation to take
1209599 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1209600 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1209601 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1209602 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1209603 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1209604 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1209605 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1209606 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1209607 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear
1209608 i want to be your tampon so i can be inside of you
1209609 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1209610 i do not want to talk about this now sergeant
1209611 i dont come to work every day to watch a soap opera
1209612 but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom
1209613 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day any day
1209614 it will be a good sign on election day if there are a lot of bikes parked outside the polling places of america
1209615 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
1209616 this is unfair because these are candidates who are alive but have been denied the right to stand in the elections whereas in june there was a candidate who was dead but was allowed to stand
1209617 asdrubals o is up a notch but is it enough
1209618 the tuna looked too fresh at the market to pass up
1209619 too bad we cant have it more than once a week i guess we have you to thank for that
1209620 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1209621 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1209622 barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate a president wholl stand up for you
1209623 i want to see whats going on the whole scenario how they got to this point
1209624 i just want to make sure they have enough stuff on this guy it sounds pretty solid but i want to see them face to face to see whats going on i just need some closure
1209625 i have no questions for them i expect no real answers from them
1209626 im not going to ask any question im just going to listen and glean the facts
1209627 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1209628 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1209629 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1209630 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1209631 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1209632 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives

1209637 this is my first time here but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom and thank you for it
1209638 i thank you all very much for that unique sturgis welcome
1209639 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day any day my friends
1209640 were not going to pay 4 dollars a gallon for gas when i am president because we are going to drill offshore and we are going to drill now we are doing to drill here and we are going to drill now
1209641 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
1209642 is there anyone that is tired of paying four dollars a gallon for gasoline is there anyone that is sick and tired of it is there anyone that wants to become energy independent
1209643 well i am telling you right now we are sending 700 billion dollars abroad and your congress just went on vacation for five weeks tell them to come back and get to work
1209644 i was looking at the sturgis schedule and noticed that you have a beauty pageant and so i encouraged cindy to compete i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1209645 i know it will be a good sign on election day if there are a lot of bikes parked outside the polling places of america so dont let november fourth find you on the open road im counting on you to show up and im asking for your vote
1209646 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1209647 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1209648 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1209649 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1209650 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1209651 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1209652 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1209653 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1209654 you always want to go out but there always comes a point of being smart
1209655 being over 100 pitches going through eight innings leaving the game is probably the best thing you dont get real caught up in the complete games and all that stuff
1209656 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like doc theres not much management to it you pretty much put him out there and let him go
1209657 theres no doubt he has a little bit of everything
1209658 i dont know how he gets it to look like that really
1209659 you look up there and its the same speed but it seems like its slower or seems like its a little sharper he knows how to pitch
1209660 i felt like my curveball was better than it has been my last couple of starts
1209661 for me that was probably the biggest difference i had more confidence throwing it in different counts
1209662 i was trying to nibble way too much trying to make perfect pitches and ended up missing by a lot most of the time
1209663 he had command issues tonight right from the first batter of the game
1209664 his arm angles seemed a bit lower than normal well review it and see if theres any adjustments that need to be made
1209665 having recently returned from a national journalism conference i was reminded how most national mainstream journalists nowadays fail to ask the most basic of questions of powerful corporate executives or government officials
1209666 since 911 of 2001 many journalists have begun to fear that being watchdogs of freedom will brand them as disloyal and anti american
1209667 here are some questions you will most likely not hear in the next few months from mainstream journalists

1209685 after two years of upward spiraling defaults the problems with mortgages made to people with weak or subprime credit are showing the first tentative signs of leveling off but with the u s economy struggling homeowners with better credit are now falling behind on their payments in growing numbers the percentage of mortgages in arrears in the category of loans one rung above subprime so called alternative a or alt a mortgages quadrupled to 12 percent in april from a year earlier delinquencies among prime loans which account for most of the 12 trillion market doubled to 2 7 percent in that time while it is difficult to draw precise parallels among various segments of the mortgage market the arc of the crisis in subprime loans suggests that the problems in the broader market may not peak for another year or two analysts said

1209690 new york aug 3 reuters the united states is in the second inning of a recession that will last for at least 18 months and help kill off hundreds of banks influential economist and new york university professor nouriel roubini told barrons in sundays edition taxpayers will pay a big price for helping bail out the rest of the financial services industry as well roubini said at least 1 trillion and more likely 2 trillion the banks will become insolvent because of mounting losses as a result of the housing bust and because they have only written down their subprime loans so far he said still in front of them are their consumer credit losses for which they lack the reserves barrons reported he also said there are hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding in home equity loans that could be worth zero too

1209712 therefore whether ivins or another scientist working for the u s government carried out the anthrax attacks is actually not the primary question the main question is who within the u s government framed arabs for the attacks and whether the attacks were motivated primarily as a justification for war against middle eastern oil countries or to intimidate the u s congress and the american people into accepting fascism the fact that the government is now trying to blame it all on american does not change the fact that it was for 7 years blamed on arabs the government is trying to neatly tie up the whole mess and bury the story but the war on terror has already been raging for close to a decade and the iraq war for some 5 years the damage caused by the false flag operation cannot so easily be erased

1209730 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1209731 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1209732 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear

1209739 when you look at your first two years and you see the 3 8 yards per carry do you want to puke
1209740 well kind of i want nine 10 yards a carry but i think the difference with me this year is im smarter i realize four yards is a good run sometimes i appreciate four yards im not disappointed when i get stopped after four yards
1209741 and the nfl will not be a fluke for me either
1209742 if i can always get four and then get more than that from time to time ill be happy
1209743 thats not fair the saints offense as a whole was less good in 2007 than in 2006 so of course his yards catch fell off

1209748 in the 20th century did art enter the marketplace and become a commodity like a stick of butter or an herm s bag
1209749 most of the over 100 percent price appreciations are not fundamentally driven
1209750 these are speculatively driven based on rumors of various things happening
1209751 if you look at the characteristics of those stocks they are low priced highly liquid and fairly popular with retail investors so that is one of the reasons why these trade frequently and prices get pushed up
1209752 in a market you need speculators and investors who look at fundamentals you need institutional investors you need retail investors basically you need all kinds of investors i think speculation is what kept our market afloat in the last six to eight months
1209753 they have got the expansion strategies right and they are controlling their costs well while building their brands i think those three banks will perform well
1209754 worldwide there has been a commodity boom so the prices for tea and rubber have moved up because of that the plantation sector will do well
1209755 some of these stocks have handsomely beaten inflation which is at 28 percent and if you had invested in a treasury bill your capital would have been eroded
1209756 as far as the overall market is concerned i dont think we will see a significant increase in the index or for that matter a significant downturn in the index its more likely to be a flat market for the year

1209762 i am deeply concerned about what the fed has done in the last year and in the last decade
1209763 chairman greenspans easy money the late nineties and then following the tech bust inflated the housing bubble and created the mess we are in today
1209764 chairman bernankes easy money in the last year has undermined the dollar and sent oil to new record highs every few days and almost doubling since the rate cuts started inflation is here and it is hurting average americans
1209765 but the fed has proven they can not be trusted with the power they have
1209766 as i said a moment ago their monetary policy is a leading cause of the mess we are in
1209767 now the fed wants to be the systemic risk regulator but the fed is the systemic risk
1209768 giving the fed more power is like giving the neighborhood kid who broke your window playing baseball in the street a bigger bat and thinking that will fix the problem
1209769 i am not going to go along with that and will use all my powers as a senator to stop any new powers going to the fed
1209770 instead we should give them less to do so they can do it right either by taking away their monetary policy responsibility or by requiring them to focus only on inflation
1209771 our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets

1209792 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things
1209793 some things im embarrassed to talk about but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1209794 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1209795 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
