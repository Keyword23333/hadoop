9250003 i was watching inconvenient truth the other day and theres the bit where it shows the sea level rising really high and flooding most of the world well i live near the sea and dont want to drown so i got to thinking maybe if we lower the sea level a bit when the water level rises then it wont rise high enough to flood anyway heres the plan everyone who can should take a bucket of sea water and pour it down the sink if lots of people put the effort in we could lower the sea level substantially and create a better world for our children to live

9250052 weve created a series of guidelines that actually outline the types of products that can be in a vending machine
9250053 it doesnt mean that a student couldnt have pizza its just a matter of whats on that pizza

9250070 i managed to make up one place and maintain that to the end of my stint we managed to keep it clean throughout the team is really good and did a great job the strategy was perfect and they deserved for us to be in first place
9250071 the team did a very good job in terms of strategy which was especially good after mosport where we struggled
9250072 this time we were a little bit lucky james did his stint with tires from qualifying and the car looked ok although there was a bit of understeer the tires looked fine as well we did put a lot of time on the tires and i dont think they could have could have lasted another 10 laps or half stint it was very close all the time
9250073 of course we would have prefered to have won the title under different circumstances
9250074 but with seven consecutive victories already this season we certainly feel we have earned the title
9250075 for the first time we didnt have any problems and we were the faster car ollie did a good job pushing the car up to the end our crew did a very good job and they have all three years michelin and compuware were great this week they are very strong and know what to do they are experienced and have a winning spirit they never give up
9250076 i havent been so kind to the car the last couple of events and it was great to reward the guys for their hard work this year
9250077 this is the place they want to win more than anywhere else it is a fantastic team and they have themselves in a position that they know the car and the series so well its one of the best sports car teams in the world if not the best
9250078 i said yesterday that my favorite part of the track was the start finish line
9250079 in my second stint i came out behind johannes and i wasnt going to make a stupid move on him unfortunately he had an incident with a prototype and then it became hard to communicate with my pit crew they couldnt hear me and i could barely hear them i unplugged the radio twisted it and suddenly it worked at the end another yellow came and i had to push a little more even after one lap there was a big gap and it was easy at the end
9250080 we are in good shape and still have to fight for race wins you have to have luck to win a championship and everyone is trying their best were keeping our heads down and going forward

9250084 because winning one game here or there is not going to cut it
9250085 as a pitcher i dont think we want to intentionally walk anybody
9250086 in the same respect youve got to do the smart thing
9250087 we do have to find a way to be more consistent than weve been
9250088 everything is fine theres no excuses basically thats not a mistake youve got to give credit to him
9250089 i guess he wasnt too happy that i hit him
9250090 i hit him with two strikes i actually did him a favor i told him that i was right here he got a little more fired up when there were 24 men behind him
9250091 i was letting him know i wasnt going to take it im just tired of getting hit
9250092 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9250093 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9250094 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9250095 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9250096 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9250097 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9250098 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9250099 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9250100 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9250101 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9250102 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9250103 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9250104 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9250105 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9250106 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9250107 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

9250113 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

9250118 friends are those angels that lift you to your feet when your own wings have forgotten how to fly
9250119 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9250120 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9250121 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9250122 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9250123 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9250124 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9250125 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9250126 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9250127 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9250128 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9250129 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9250130 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9250131 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9250132 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9250133 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9250138 oh forget what everyone else says everyone likes to tell you what to do just do what you need to do and you will make it work theres no secret to owning a business
9250139 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9250140 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9250141 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9250142 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

9250144 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9250145 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9250157 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9250158 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9250159 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9250160 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9250161 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9250162 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9250163 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9250164 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9250165 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9250166 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9250167 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9250168 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9250169 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9250170 who are open to doing something on the production side
9250171 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9250172 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9250173 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9250174 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9250175 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9250205 gli inquirenti siano in grado di assicurare subito alla giustizia i responsabili di questo gesto criminale verificando con assoluta certezza se dietro di esso esista una forma organizzata di estremismo di destra
9250206 tutte le forze politiche cittadine a vigilare affinch non si inneschi una nuova spirale di violenza politica in citt
9250207 se gli inquirenti confermeranno che si tratta di un pestaggio per motivi politici ha detto sar ancora pi grave perch ci riporterebbe ad anni che pensavamo di esserci lasciati alle spalle
9250208 unaggressione pi che premeditata studiata nei minimi particolari dopo aver atteso che la gran parte dei presenti fosse andata via cos come limponente spiegamento di forza pubblica
9250209 che un grande paese come litalia abbia una grande e solida compagnia

9250211 non ha niente a che fare con i principi della concorrenza che di solito sono sostenuti da lui per i consumatori significa servizio peggiore a prezzi piu alti per i concorrenti europei dellitalia diventa scandaloso il modo spensierato in cui il governo italiano sta violando le regole del mercato unico europeo
9250212 ricorda fortemente il modo di agire che legalmente viene bollato come bancarotta fraudolenta i pezzi di valore vengono aggirati i debiti i dipendenti in esubero ed altri problemi restano aperti per evitare che questo diventi uno scandalo alla fine lo stato italiano deve pagare tutti i conti ma questi pagamenti non sono nientaltro che un immenso nuovo sussidio per la vecchia alitalia o per il nuovo monopolista italiano del volo
9250213 of course this is real life and not a novel so one hopes and prays that no one will be hurt
9250214 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9250215 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9250216 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9250217 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9250218 no se puede permitir que ning n pa s domine energ ticamente a europa

9250221 no se puede permitir que ning n pa s domine energ ticamente a europa
9250222 so todd and sarah are scratching their heads saying why is this guy representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know so from their perspective everybodys protecting him audi probably disagrees with me walt monegan does and i understand its really touchy but i just want you to understand that cops that use excessive force or go out of the lines they just have no tolerance because theyve seen the facts personally
9250223 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9250224 queremos dejar sentado un precedente para que se inicie el debate que a nuestro juicio se encuentra pendiente respecto de la propiedad del agua

9250227 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9250228 como consecuencia de lo anterior el cementerio ubicado en la comunidad de quepuca ralco qued inundado bajo las aguas del ahora lago ralco frente a esta situaci n las familias afectadas nos hemos movilizado desde esa fecha con el fin de hacer respetar el compromiso asumido por el gobierno de chile de desenterrar los cuerpos y trasladarlos a otro sitio

9250240 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9250241 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal

9250243 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
9250244 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos

9250269 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9250270 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9250271 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9250272 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9250273 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9250286 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9250287 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9250296 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9250297 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9250298 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9250299 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9250300 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9250301 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9250302 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9250305 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9250306 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9250307 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9250308 creo que la convocatoria a refer ndum de la constituci n pol tica del estado cumple con una constante demanda de los sectores sociales e ind gena de bolivia que esperaban esta medida
9250309 ahora la propuesta de constituci n pol tica del estado que tanto ha costado hacer va ser aprobada o rechazada por el soberano a trav s de su voto y el gobierno tiene que hacer lo que el pueblo mande
9250310 no es m s que atender al pedido de los diferentes sectores del pa s que quieren decidir libremente sobre la aceptaci n de la propuesta de constituci n
9250311 efectivamente la propuesta de constituci n tiene muchas de nuestras demandas que haremos conocer a nuestras comunidades guaran es
9250312 incorpora y reconoce los derechos colectivos de los pueblos ind genas
9250313 los derechos de los pueblos ind genas y adem s derechos fundamentales de los diferentes grupos y clases sociales de bolivia especialmente de aquellos que durante muchos a os no fueron tomados en cuenta o eran utilizados por intereses indiviuduales
9250314 como pueblos queremos llegar al refer ndum y decidir con nuestro voto no estamos de acuerdo con aquellos grupos que se oponen a esta consulta porque lo que quieren es callarnos violando nuestro derecho a la libre expresi n
9250315 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
9250316 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9250317 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9250318 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9250319 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9250320 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9250321 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
9250322 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche

9250325 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche

9250332 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

9250340 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
9250341 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little coordination between them
9250342 blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
9250343 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
9250344 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
9250345 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application vehicles
9250346 as more cars are sold there is a demand for more drivers
9250347 transporters also want drivers for commercial vehicles where the need for training is perhaps most acute

9250351 there are so many opportunities for servicemembers to earn a higher education
9250352 and there should be just as many opportunities for their spouses because we proudly serve our country too

9250356 our defense scored as many points as they allowed youre going to win most times when that happens for sure
9250357 i thought a amp m commerce gave us a tough game
9250358 you dont take wins lightly we won the game we left a ton of room to improve but we won the game and thats the main objective we gave good effort tonight and you can build from that

9250362 he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident outside a mcdonalds restaurant in liverpool city centre
9250363 he got a fastball up to bruce and he put a backup slider right in pattersons wheelhouse we had the matchups taschner couldnt make a pitch
9250364 its gotta be location because the stuff is still there
9250365 im throwing beach balls up there ive not gotten anyone out its embarrassing that we score that many runs and cant get a win
9250366 i was trying to calm myself down i thought i relaxed very well after that
9250367 that was one of the best seven innings weve had from our young pitchers this year maybe the best
9250368 if he feels any pain at all he wont pitch
9250369 our minor league people who have seen him in the past said he starts slow early in the year and finishes strong
9250370 but you know its always a possibility when youre a third string quarterback
9250371 it was a situation that i didnt really know what to expect
9250372 i did all that i could do i got a lot of reps i just know that i did all that i could
9250373 i think how the process works is that i will literally know in the next 24 hours when or not i will be with another team
9250374 i do have some good film from preseason so that helps
9250375 its kind of a hard decision to make but it is the decision we made at this point and well go forward
9250376 we havent seen the day to day to day that you need i know its contrary to popular belief
9250377 its important that we start our season healthy and ive made that very clear to you guys from the start that it was important that we started the year that way and we have an opportunity to put as close to as many guys out there that we know are going to be healthy as we can and that can practice day to day and so forth
9250378 willie was out of the locker room all of last year so ive already made that clear to you too at one point this summer that this could happen that willie was out of the locker room a lot
9250379 he means a lot but yet last year he was dealing with trying to get himself back and healthy and he was not there a lot of the time
9250380 were probably a couple weeks away from seeing him and making a determination on him we elected to keep an extra guy just so we make sure that when we go into baltimore i know ive got the right guy to suit up on sunday
9250381 hes never had that opportunity so this is his chance
9250382 this is what hes asked for and wanted hes worked extremely hard to return from his injury to have this opportunity and hes made good on it now its time so he has everything to play and it ought to be exciting to him
9250383 i dont think that had anything to do with the decision
9250384 the possibility of claiming a player or two at some point by noon today and well settle our practice squad
9250385 its a reminder bust your tail because it can be taken away from anybody
9250386 very tough he has been significant to me he has been significant to this organization beyond me
9250387 its important that we start our season healthy and ive made that very clear
9250388 fell off in 07 and we just havent seen a lot of change thus far this year
9250389 big willie meant a lot to the team hes going to go to another team and be very successful i wish him the best i just hope he doesnt come back and play against us
9250390 a little bit of a bruised pitching hand for me everybody is ok
9250391 after a long day of a game and travel from houston my hand is a little bruised up but my car is smashed up really bad
9250392 my mom always told me accidents happen within a mile of home and i believe it thats why the closer i get to home the more careful i am and the slower i drive

9250496 diplomatic efforts through missions abroad are limited and limiting more and more countries such as barbados and the islands of the caribbean are going to have to turn to influential lobbyists including networking on capitol hill to have our concerns raised and interests represented the days of merely sending a diplomatic note in the hope of being heard are long gone additionally the us political system is quite different to ours the role of congress is different to our house the president may have one agenda and the congress may have another that reality needs to be effectively understood and relations with congressmen assume great importance

9250584 it took us only a short time to fully appreciate the impact this lifestyle brand has and we are elated to be at the forefront of the xtreme soccer platform
9250585 we are thrilled to enter our silver anniversary season in the new and exciting format of xtreme soccer
9250586 being part of a group that is committed to long term success and understands the value of such an amazing product is truly special
9250587 soccer played a major role in my life and those of my partners
9250588 to be a part of this lifestyle brand is a dream come true
9250589 im doing all of the precautions icing stretching with that i think ill be able to get by until the end of the season ill take the next step after that if i still have it
9250590 hes felt better with the exercise program that hes been on

9250593 asked j j picollo the assistant general manager for scouting and player development
9250594 with ryan the fact that hes on the roster our lack of right handed power and the fact hes having a pretty good year in triple a i think it would be good for us to get a look at him
9250595 but it does affect the number of at bats available its tough to get them both up here at the same time were still working through all of that to see how we can possibly do it
9250596 it wasnt like i could have prevented it by doing more abs or anything
9250597 thats how i look at it i feel with every start i was getting better gaining confidence getting more comfortable i was seeing it result wise maybe the results werent as good but i felt i got better as a pitcher from the beginning of the year until now
9250598 when i first came up i thought i had to be perfect to get big league hitters out as a result i think i had 30 walks and 40 strikeouts at one point i wasnt near the strike zone
9250599 but when i got more comfortable i realized that the big thing was just getting ahead strike one strike two
9250600 well you get in the mindset that you have to throw perfect pitches even when you dont have to
9250601 if you attack the hitters and the strike zone you then let the hitters do something wrong if you get ahead in the count you put the pressure on them
9250602 it took awhile but i started to realize i didnt have to be perfect i saw more stretches where i felt i could be dominant just go after hitters blow up hitters thats how you do it you may get hit once in a while but if you go after hitters chances are that good things will happen for you
9250603 i started to go with the feel of the game when to go inside when to go outside when to work in the breaking ball ever since then i was in that mode i felt i was making pitches i was happy
9250604 thats what ill think about this offseason games like that
9250605 generally speaking just because someones contract is up in our business doesnt mean a renewal has to be done right then its not like they just stop working before something gets done
9250606 im 45 or 46 whatever i lied about being older when i first ran for senate because back then i was only 15
9250607 and i wear glasses just like she does i am more experienced at wearing glasses however and im also a woman
9250608 despite californias mandate to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases the california energy commission is allowing new power plants to be built without evaluating their impacts on climate change
9250609 the energy commission needs to champion clean energy by making sure new energy sources reduce harm to the climate
9250610 business as usual is devastating to our climate and local environment
9250611 global warming is already harming sierra species like the pika and is projected to have a significant effect on the states snowpack and water supplies in the near future
9250612 california is so fortunate that the california environmental quality act requires state and local agencies to implement global warming solutions available today

9250619 with the high cost of fuel there are many new motorcycle owners that havent gotten proper training although this dvd is meant for police motorcycle officers civilian riders will get a lot out of this dvd
9250620 i had always admired how well my local motorcops rode so when i heard about this dvd i had to have it
9250621 i really liked the classroom lecture and then taking those concepts to the field training i learned a lot but most importantly i saw how i was making mistakes in braking so this training video really helped me to be a better rider
9250622 all motor officers especially newly assigned officers should have this dvd in their educational library
9250623 there are many tips in the classroom segments and safety reminders like properly mounting and dismounting your motorcycle during the field training

9250644 we send our congratulations to gov sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president

9250665 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9250666 a little trivia for you today ladies and gentlemen in seat 9b is the best chocolate chip cookie maker in the whole world
9250667 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9250668 the biggest aspect is the team is held accountable beals said
9250669 unfortunately there are going to be good teams who do not qualify for the tournament wisbey said
9250670 if we had fifa level officials doing our games maybe it would make more sense
9250671 but with a ref program in the state which is not up to par
9250672 if you have 12 yellow cards during a 16 game season you have a problem that needs to be addressed beals said
9250673 i think once everyone understands the new rules theyll take steps to make sure it doesnt happen
9250674 it made me stop and take a look at what we were doing boles said
9250675 i came to the conclusion we can control it we can fix it
9250676 i think its important to work with the officials not against them boles said
9250677 i talked to officials before the game i tell them our goal is to eliminate yellow cards i say if you see a problem developing let me know and ill get that player out of the game
9250678 thats not a team id want to play wisbey said
9250679 you could potentially be going against a team with a lot of angry players
9250680 if they want to play by these rules when a team gets to 12 their season should be over
9250681 we are making proactive efforts to encourage our employees to consider whether they want to try an alternative schedule
9250682 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9250683 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9250684 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9250685 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9250686 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9250687 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9250688 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9250689 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9250690 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9250691 we are very excited about this season we have a load of talent on our squad and we return key veteran players and weve added talented juniors and sophomores into the mix this is an experienced hard working dedicated group of players many have been playing together since the seventh grade in our school system were working hard to get back into the finals this year and looking forward to the season
9250692 we have great team chemistry and that will lead to a very good season
9250693 i am very excited and optimistic about this season and team we have many returning players as well as some strong new players who will be able to add to our team both offensively and defensively
9250694 in my first year id like to be able to come out strong finishing 500 would be ideal my goal is to have this team make the playoffs every year
9250695 i am looking forward to a very exciting year last year was a rebuilding year and this year im pleased to see that not only have the starters that returned matured in their skill abilities but the people who didnt start have improved as well the girls are very excited and have been extremely positive
9250696 last season the team advanced to the semifinals but returns only one starter we are inexperienced but have a good mix of athletes how well we learn the game and come together as a team will determine what type of success we will have all the players are working hard the attitude is great and we show improvements everyday though it may take a while to gel i expect us to be very competitive within the league i dont know much about the division and am mainly concerned with our development and if the right pieces fall together anything could happen
9250697 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9250698 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9250699 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9250700 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9250701 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9250702 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
9250703 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9250704 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9250705 ignoring the problem reflects a liberal live for today attitude unworthy of our great country
9250706 discuss the status of the pennichuck puc filings and future proceedings
9250707 it would be nice to get before the public and explain to them all the good reasons why we continued to pursue the acquisition and what the benefits are to them
9250708 i am exploring all of my options to determine what i think is in the best interest of the city
9250709 i see myself doing a similar thing with pennichuck at an appropriate time when the process moves forward
9250710 dont expect much honesty transparency or accountability from climate armageddonites
9250711 observed climate change and the negligible global effect of greenhouse gas emission limits in the state of colorado
9250712 the system of modern capitalism will generate ever larger environmental consequences outstripping efforts to manage them
9250713 it is unimaginable that american politics as we know it will deliver the transformative changes needed
9250714 it really has nothing to do with his stand on global warming
9250715 hes a great faculty member hes an institution at csu
9250716 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9250717 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9250718 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9250719 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9250720 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9250721 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9250722 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9250723 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9250724 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9250725 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9250726 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9250727 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9250728 to be honest as much as americans politics is a fun spectator sport i personally havent seen it significantly influence a campaign in canada
9250729 gilford won it all without any seniors contributing until someone beats them thats who were chasing
9250730 i am very excited for this season we have a great group of volleyball players who know the game and have skills to play it well with eight returning varsity players and several players who played club ball this winter we should be very competitive throughout the season
9250731 these girls have shown such a great deal of enthusiasm and motivation everyday we have stepped foot into the gym for practice
9250732 this year we have a young team with tons of potential
9250733 we have 12 great kids and the preseasons been very good as we start to develop a chemistry we could be challenging come playoff time
9250734 i couldnt ask for a better group of young ladies they are game smart cohesive athletic and hard working they have invested a lot to get to where they are and i think this year with the experience of our senior leadership we are going to see good things happen
9250735 that right there popping into my head shouldnt really bother me
9250736 she was there she wasnt going anywhere but it was not a good feeling i felt sick to my stomach even though norman i could tell he was angry and hurt
9250737 my heart was so tight my chest was tight i had to do my breathing get myself under control i was jittery on the bench there i couldnt get myself comfortable
9250738 i looked at her a couple of times i wont tell you what i was thinking
9250739 the good lord is my judge and justice will be served
9250740 i have a lot of faith and its very strong in me thats what really is giving me the strength to go on
9250741 i cant right now i want to hold on and just hold on
9250742 ive had a lot of time to think on this one
9250743 ive been to six national conventions each time as a delegate
9250744 ive seen what teachers are doing with their kids in the classroom
9250745 i can honestly say i wouldnt have to ask those questions
9250746 there will be many things he will not be allowed to vote on
9250747 i think its unconscionable that we have the number of schools in need of improvement that we have
9250748 there are kids with purple hair and hip huggers not on the hips
9250749 hes familiar obviously with the school system and the teachers and i think for the short run that is what is needed
9250750 we need to take a look at whether we should be consolidating
9250751 i do know that each school is doing things somewhat differently
9250752 what do you think these students that you ground are doing
9250753 the board is an important part of the school district
9250754 it is there to make policy but it is also there to listen to administration as to what is happening how things are happening and why things are happening
9250755 ecamm networks phoneviews has many talents including using your iphone as a storage device when connected to your mac copying the iphones music videos and photos to your computer and viewing and editing the iphones notes you can export the phones sms messages as text files which you can then print its easy to use install it plug in your iphone and phoneview launches to access the phones sms messages just click the sms entry on the left side of the phoneview window you can copy individual messages command click to copy several messages helpful when you want to copy just those messages that are part of a particular conversation or copy all messages by selecting one message pressing command a to select them all and clicking the copy from iphone button at the top of the window
9250756 but ive had over a week to think about it so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9250757 i would have loved it if we could have met in the final
9250758 my biggest worry is that shes so good sorry but im thinking about how im going to get past her
9250759 shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best its nice to feel like when youre playing your best
9250760 right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9250761 i have a very good feeling about the next round i saw serena play against her i dont know how to say her first name too well
9250762 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
9250763 to get a tax deduction you would have to be working at home full time
9250764 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9250765 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9250766 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9250767 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9250768 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9250769 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9250770 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9250771 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9250772 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9250773 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9250774 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9250775 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9250776 we have plenty of time to evaluate what to do with the remaining elements of business and would make those decisions along the way
9250777 its the reason things are cheaper at wal mart than at mom and pop grocery store
9250778 whether it actually will do that then youre trying to predict the future at this point i dont have any reason to think it wont work out as anticipated
9250779 we would expect in particular because of the economic benefits of the mitigation fund to remain in a position to serve our remaining customers
9250780 i think thats unfortunate when you consider that most of the people that would be affected live in the nashua area
9250781 but he was lucky enough not to have gone in the water because he would have been swept away
9250782 the one hour commute that may not have bothered people before is becoming an issue not because of the time but because of the price of gas
9250783 i make it a point to shower every morning get up early have enough coffee to start my day
9250784 but to be honest most days i dont put makeup on i wear comfortable clothes like jeans
9250785 theres really so little reason to have to be physically in the same place
9250786 i work from home and our whole staff works from home
9250787 its such a growing trend in hiring the wall street journal listed it as the number one employment trend
9250788 iraqis and the iraqi government must make realistic progress on reconciliation
9250789 oil revenue sharing cannot be an ad hoc provincial process job programs need formal codification iraqi security forces must fill the space between peace and anarchy
9250790 while the situation remains difficult our military commanders cite that al qaida in iraq is increasingly isolated and on the defensive
9250791 attacks have been reduced fatalities have been reduced iraqi citizens who left the country are returning and iraqi security forces are increasingly assuming more day to day control over areas of their country
9250792 political reconciliation is also occurring through power sharing arrangements and the government confronting militias
9250793 should listen carefully to the recommendations of our military leaders rather than make politically motivated decisions congress should also ensure that our troops have the resources they need to succeed
9250794 with a strong military presence and a strong diplomatic agenda
9250795 we reduce the risks to our armed services serving in the region and we increase the chances for greater political success in the region and especially with respect to the iraqi government itself
9250796 we need to reassert ourselves as the primary broker of peace between the israelis and palestinians we need to show the leaders of the middle east that the american people are committed to peace although prepared for conflict
9250797 the progress that should receive primary focus consists of turning over security responsibility to the iraqi government and away from the u s military this is ongoing and the effort should be ramped up as much as possible
9250798 declared that iraq would be the top battlefield in their efforts to assault america and they are losing we need to do a better job of articulating this message and counteracting the hatred unleashed by bin laden and his followers
9250799 american forces should be transitioned out of iraq and can be redeployed to areas like afghanistan in order to bring the war on terror to the terrorists
9250800 we must also make clear to our allies in nato that the war on terror is a global war and these terrorists are poised to strike member nations as they have in the u s spain turkey and england and have planned in italy and other countries
9250801 should explain why our military is in afghanistan to begin with there are terrorists all over the world yet the u s seems to be pursuing them only in iraq and afghanistan if this is truly a global war on terror as the president describes it why is it limited to two countries
9250802 i am hopeful that such a trend will continue as our partner nations realize the importance of this effort
9250803 a long term commitment of u s troops in an iraqi civil war is not in the interest of the u s iraq or the wider middle east
9250804 we are there and we must finish what we started
9250805 premature withdrawal would also open the door to mass ethnic cleansing and possible genocide
9250806 the military diplomatic and political progress would be squandered if we were to withdraw before iraq was ready to secure its own borders and protect its own cities
9250807 needs to listen to our generals they have shown they have the expertise to assess well the military and political situation on the ground in iraq
9250808 is only one front of the global war on terrorism the way we win is by setting the tone globally that terrorism will not be ignored
9250809 an iranian attack against israel would be a threat to peace in all regions of the world
9250810 before i could support any military action i would need to be convinced not only that such action were in the national interest and in response to a clear threat but that there was a clear and achievable mission
9250811 i have not yet seen such a mission described in iran
9250812 if a diplomatic solution is not soon achieved the next congress and president may very well face a world crisis over an attack by israel to forestall nuclear weapons development in iran
9250813 irans missile tests also reinforce the need to expand our missile defense system into europe
9250814 the war in iraq was a war of choice not a war of necessity
9250815 the rise in violence and casualties in afghanistan have made it very apparent that additional troops are needed in the country
9250816 we cannot allow that government to fall to islamic radicals
9250817 they have a vested interest in securing peace in the middle east
9250818 the united states needs to encourage the nations in the region to have an open dialogue with each other the united states must act proactively by coordinating diplomatic political and economic solutions
9250819 it will be up to nato as a whole to police itself and its member countries regarding the commitment being made to the organization as a whole
9250820 congress should use its diplomatic leverage to assist american efforts to increase allied assistance in afghanistan but withholding aid to our nato allies would be counterproductive
9250821 third party or independent candidates can split votes and cause political upheavals even if they have no hope of gaining office
9250822 what if mccain goes down is she ready to lead
9250823 her fifth child was born with downs syndrome anyone who has a child with or without any sort of special needs knows that being a committed mother is not easy
9250824 older mothers account for only about 9 of all live births each year and 25 of down syndrome births
9250825 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9250826 thanks be to god that gov palin is pro life and the baby wasnt one of the 80 of down syndrome lives that are aborted each year
9250827 say a prayer for gov palin and her family and thank god that the baby is blessed with a pro life family
9250828 im sorry but my maternal instincts oh party of touted family values are having a little trouble balancing this devoted wife and mother of five spiel with an infant born in april with down syndrome and flitting about the country chasing a vice presidency
9250829 i will understand and probably agree with you but i will not agree that anything ive said is sexist i would say the same about any man
9250830 our working families are struggling to cope with the rapidly increasing costs of their basic needs especially gasoline heating fuel and food lynch said in a statement
9250831 this increase in the states minimum wage will help provide some relief for new hampshires hardworking families
9250832 we must find a way to help women and men develop skills and make use of essential supports so as to become financially independent smith said
9250833 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9250834 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9250835 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9250836 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9250837 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9250838 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9250839 you might want to get down here earlier rather than later the lines are getting long
9250840 a song about the love and compassion of the dali lamas heart
9250841 and john olivers down there do you like the daily show
9250842 ivyy i read all your columns your ideas on sex and relationships have helped me shape my stance on healthcare reform and inspired my passion for saving the environment keep up the good work
9250843 are they going to have the video obama introduce the real obama that would be cool
9250844 george bush sucks and got us involved in an unwinnable war that is sacrificing the lives of our young soldiers and severely hurting our already tenuous foreign relations hahaha
9250845 were walking so why do we have to wait for the bus with the other people waiting for the bus
9250846 ron pauls not stupid he wants to send you to college ron pauls not stupid he wants to send you to college
9250847 there might be a chance we survive eight years of bush i dont know thats where the hope comes in
9250848 barack obamas message of hope has inspired americans all across the country and we couldnt imagine a more fitting place for robert indiana to unveil his hope sculpture than at the convergence of this movement for change in denver
9250849 its really a brother to love or a sister or a very close family member
9250850 hed like to have on his resume that in the 60s he created the love generation and in the next millennium he brought hope to the world
9250851 if obama wins the election wed like to see it on the white house lawn
9250852 i think hes being terribly optimistic that hope will one day equal the popularity of love
9250853 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9250854 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9250855 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9250856 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9250857 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9250858 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9250859 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9250860 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9250861 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9250862 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9250863 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9250864 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9250865 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9250866 we want a change that is going to help us all
9250867 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9250868 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9250869 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9250870 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9250871 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9250872 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9250873 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9250874 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9250875 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9250876 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9250877 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9250878 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9250879 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9250880 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9250881 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9250882 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9250883 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9250884 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9250885 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9250886 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9250887 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9250888 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9250889 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9250890 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9250891 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9250892 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9250893 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9250894 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9250895 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9250896 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9250897 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9250898 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9250899 the only time i ever saw my mother really angry was when she saw cruelty
9250900 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9250901 they had their chance they have not led we will
9250902 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9250903 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9250904 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9250905 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9250906 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9250907 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9250908 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9250909 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9250910 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9250911 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9250912 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9250913 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9250914 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9250915 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9250916 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9250917 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9250918 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9250919 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9250920 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9250921 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9250922 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9250923 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9250924 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9250925 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9250926 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9250927 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9250928 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9250929 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9250930 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9250931 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9250932 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9250933 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9250934 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9250935 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9250936 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9250937 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9250938 weve been a band for 10 years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
9250939 if god doesnt live in colorado at least thats where he spends most of his time
9250940 the american people think if the latest luntz poll is to be believed that the institutions of the republic are failing that the government mainly the executive branch which was suppose to serve them no longer does
9250941 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9250942 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9250943 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9250944 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9250945 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9250946 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9250947 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9250948 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9250949 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9250950 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9250951 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9250952 hillary this time i cant go with you i got to go with obama
9250953 but im going to send you a check and i know that a lot of the women thats with you were not going to fall out were not going to disagree we are more intelligent than that
9250954 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9250955 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9250956 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9250957 sen obama this is truly a good day for america how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9250958 the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin
9250959 in the meantime while on the look out ill be hoping for a more compassionate government from the next president
9250960 i dont know what i despise more ageism of all kinds
9250961 because you must be 18 to enlist 18 is a suitable minimum voting age
9250962 also i assume a president can exercise compassion without defying the constitution
9250963 gee why do we let them vote shouldnt we screen the registration system so only the intelligent and deserving dont worry john im sure youd make the cut are able to cast ballots
9250964 first of all your little plan of only letting smart educated people vote is going to backfire since polls show that more educated people overwhelmingly back obama
9250965 shame on you for assuming that younger people dont take the time to learn the issues and are just swayed by a charismatic man and shame on you for thinking you are better than us just because you are older and here i was always taught we were all created equal
9250966 only a moron would utter such words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
9250967 only a moron would utter those words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
9250968 those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it
9250969 you are helpless in this mess so we will fix it for you
9250970 cut taxes for 95 of the working people raise taxes on 5 raise taxes on business
9250971 how do you know when a politician is lying their lips are moving
9250972 that only goes to show how ridiculous our modern education system has become there is no wisdom in universities anymore any moron can get into college these days and the fact that obama is a harvard graduate does not say much for harvard
9250973 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
9250974 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9250975 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9250976 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9250977 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them gore said
9250978 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9250979 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9250980 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9250981 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9250982 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9250983 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9250984 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9250985 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9250986 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9250987 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9250988 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9250989 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9250990 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9250991 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9250992 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9250993 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9250994 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9250995 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9250996 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9250997 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9250998 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9250999 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9251000 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9251001 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9251002 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9251003 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9251004 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9251005 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9251006 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9251007 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9251008 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9251009 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9251010 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9251011 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9251012 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9251013 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9251014 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9251015 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9251016 a few years ago i made the documentary an inconvenient truth my motivations were to educate folks out there that the globe is warming at an alarming rate all the worlds top scientists agree on this and believe we
9251017 it is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly quickly and wisely
9251018 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9251019 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9251020 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9251021 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
9251022 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
9251023 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
9251024 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
9251025 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
9251026 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
9251027 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9251028 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9251029 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9251030 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9251031 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9251032 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9251033 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9251034 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9251035 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9251036 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9251037 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9251038 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9251039 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9251040 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9251041 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9251042 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9251043 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9251044 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9251045 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9251046 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9251047 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9251048 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9251049 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9251050 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9251051 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9251052 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9251053 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9251054 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9251055 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9251056 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9251057 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9251058 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9251059 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9251060 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9251061 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9251062 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9251063 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
9251064 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9251065 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9251066 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9251067 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9251068 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9251069 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9251070 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9251071 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9251072 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9251073 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9251074 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9251075 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9251076 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9251077 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9251078 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9251079 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9251080 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9251081 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

9251083 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9251084 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9251085 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
9251086 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
9251087 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
9251088 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
9251089 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
9251090 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
9251091 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9251092 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9251093 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9251094 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9251095 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9251096 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9251097 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9251098 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9251099 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9251100 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9251101 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9251102 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9251103 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9251104 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9251105 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9251106 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9251107 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9251108 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9251109 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9251110 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9251111 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9251112 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9251113 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9251114 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9251115 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9251116 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9251117 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9251118 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9251119 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9251120 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9251121 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9251122 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9251123 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9251124 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9251125 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9251126 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9251127 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9251128 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9251129 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9251130 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9251131 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9251132 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9251133 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9251134 sandia national laboratories and stirling energy systems ses set a new solar to grid system conversion efficiency record by achieving a 31 25 percent net efficiency rate
9251135 the conversion efficiency is calculated by measuring the net energy delivered to the grid and dividing it by the solar energy hitting the dish mirrors auxiliary loads such as water pumps computers and tracking motors are accounted for in the net power measurement
9251136 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
9251137 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
9251138 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
9251139 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9251140 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9251141 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9251142 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9251143 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9251144 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9251145 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9251146 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9251147 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9251148 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9251149 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9251150 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9251151 i guess if its going to make you so sad to drop me off
9251152 at that point residents would be told though not physically forced to leave new orleans
9251153 our wine tasting is five to taste we two different lists pay to taste list complimentary list five total
9251154 we see patients with burns from campfires and sometimes fireworks at labor day
9251155 you have people driving to picnics to family to friends
9251156 its a different type of traffic i dont think labor day is different than a majority of the other holidays
9251157 if youre signed up to work monday and tuesday you work monday and tuesday
9251158 at least not for awhile the gate and the walls flanking it recently were dismantled so that it could be rebuilt and relocated farther away from the traffic along main street
9251159 teaching new teachers which was the fundamental element of the new schools mission
9251160 nearly 40 years in the field of education a career that she had begun when she was only 16 years old
9251161 first and probably most beloved faculty member of kent state college
9251162 we remember her not because of what she taught but what she was
9251163 a fitting symbol of the college as an entrance into the larger life
9251164 i like to think of the thousands of homecomers new students visitors and friends who will pass through it and find pleasure in it
9251165 i cannot deny that my pleasure in seeing her name there is akin to that of the child who sees his name on the honor roll
9251166 one time rivals barack obama and hillary rodham clinton praised rep
9251167 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9251168 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9251169 the mayor said she was not a fair weather friend i certainly know what that means
9251170 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she
9251171 senator i am 83 years old two days ago you provided me and many in this nation the opportunity to see something that we thought we would never in our lifetime see
9251172 and she routinely made her congressional staff traditional southern meals
9251173 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9251174 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9251175 thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again
9251176 the health of the church is a far greater concern than the health of the nation the primary injury caused by mainline protestant decline is not social but spiritual
9251177 now liberal protestantism sees conversionist missions as an embarrassment committed to a radical doctrinal relativism these denominations have served as poster children for virtually every theological fad and liberal proposal imaginable now many of these denominations are involved in court fights to keep churches from leaving the stream has indeed run dry
9251178 after youve read a few of these outraged complaints however the targets begin to blur together
9251179 we have the same responsibility to care for our bodies and our minds
9251180 be acted out so that each of us gets the most out of the bodies we inhabit

9251189 est en funci n de dictador y no de presidente constitucional
9251190 el gobierno del movimiento al socialismo mas ha sepultado por decreto la democracia boliviana demostrando su talante autoritario buscando la eternizaci n en el poder

9251195 a las fuerzas armadas y polic a nacional no asumir acciones en contra del pueblo ante las solicitudes de uso de la fuerza del gobierno nacional y prevenir el derramamiento de sangre de los bolivianos
9251196 al ser por decreto supremo la convocatoria tiene una inconsistencia jur dica podr a haberse hecho con una ley de convocatoria
9251197 yo no voy a renunciar voy a pelear no estoy de acuerdo con lo que est sucediendo por lo menos a m que me procesen
9251198 ni siquiera ha concluido la asamblea constituyente queda una sesi n veo que hay muchas irregularidades y en lo que se refiere a mi persona cuando llegue el momento mi voto va a ser para que no administremos esa convocatoria
9251199 vamos a hacer un an lisis de la norma porque no tenemos el decreto s lo sabemos lo que dicen los peri dicos pero ya hay visos de que no corresponder a
9251200 se tiene que hacer una auditor a para confiabilidad de toda la ciudadan a
9251201 nosotros pedimos al doctor jos luis exeni presidente de la cne que previamente a cualquier proceso por la observaci n que hizo la oea se realice la auditor a
9251202 el padr n est sucio contaminado y tiene varios problemas no creemos que sea conveniente hacer ning n proceso bajo las condiciones que se encuentra el padr n no se trata de hacer una auditor a a la corte porque mi problema o cuestionamiento no va a salir de la auditor a habr a que hacer una auditor a a la direcci n nacional de identificaci n
9251203 s podemos llevar adelante estos procesos pero primero debemos analizar los decretos en sala plena
9251204 no lo vamos a permitir el ingreso de los masistas a la plaza cuando nosotros vamos a sus pueblos nos tratan como a perros queremos la independencia no queremos a esta raza maldita en nuestra tierra
9251205 asumiendo el control y la administraci n de las instituciones p blicas y todos los recursos econ micos que vinieran del departamento y as resistir al gobierno de facto del movimiento al socialismo
9251206 la lucha de los departamentos aut nomos ya no es por idh sino por la libertad
9251207 en el marco del di logo en una reuni n de emergencia del gabinete la noche del jueves hemos decidido buscar un nuevo acercamiento para resolver los problemas
9251208 por encima est un proyecto constitucional que quiere sepultar las autonom as
9251209 el di logo ha muerto con la aprobaci n del paquetazo de decretos
9251210 el entendimiento es la nica forma en la cual bolivia puede salir airosa no s lo para aprobar la constituci n no s lo para poner l mites a las desigualdades sino tambi n para poder hacerlo en paz y armon a
9251211 cuando alguien quiere hacer un golpe lo que corresponder hacer es resistirlo y le aseguro que la intenci n del gobierno v a el golpe es aprobar su instrumento para quedarse en el poder
9251212 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9251213 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9251214 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9251215 the residents will see their valuation decrease and businesses will see a modest increase
9251216 youre seeing a classification shift to the commercial and the industrial area so theyre going to be picking up more of the load
9251217 the governor as well as the president of the senate and the house speaker sent a letter to us saying we really didnt mean to do that
9251218 we still have to provide those services but we arent going to get any more money to do it
9251219 the county strives for what we call same price per resident
9251220 thats an objective that weve set for many years now the cost of government should have the same price per resident year after year
9251221 the first was for the super bowl to see the redskins win in what was it 92
9251222 st paul is mentioned many times in the bible but minneapolis never
9251223 and the city has bent way over backwards for us
9251224 right now st paul cops are trying to get the secret service to do something for us that for two months weve been told cant be done
9251225 weve been to washington d c and other places and this is one of the cleanest prettiest cities with the nicest people weve ever seen we saw more water coming in on the airplane than we have in the whole state of arizona
9251226 jesusito esta es la canci n que me aprendi hoy

9251229 love the way u report the news rick it makes me think
9251230 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9251231 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9251232 residents have the choice to remain behind and weather the storms
9251233 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9251234 just as the chinese indian japanese and the germans in theirs
9251235 the host in this case the malays are not of the same status as the
9251236 or those who came from other region or plain or country to settle here
9251237 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9251238 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9251239 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9251240 what hes done to come back and to win a ball game like that is just huge for him huge for us and huge for the city
9251241 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
9251242 no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9251243 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it
9251244 i felt the same as i did the last time against them
9251245 you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times when you are good
9251246 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things
9251247 i do not know why they are all coming now
9251248 if i am to lose this is how i would like to
9251249 he was so thin it looked like hed break if you hit him
9251250 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9251251 lo que voy a hacer es darles al estudio cinematogr fico una peque a cantidad de material para una historia y que esto ser usado como base para algo que ellos podr n construir
9251252 ser algo del material que no usamos del primer libro para la pel cula como los cap tulos 3 y 4 ser algo de ah as que de forma ligera se puede decir que sigue estando basada en la mini pero muy ligera lo mejor de esto es que al ser un producto de propiedad de sus autores jg y yo seguiremos siendo los productores de esta cosa y seguiremos cobrando por los derechos

9251258 why i guess the nfl folks couldnt find a better act why not bon jovi or maroon 5
9251259 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9251260 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9251261 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9251262 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9251263 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9251264 m lningarna ska upplevas som ett m te med en m nniska
9251265 it is going to be hard for your colleagues who apply to some other institute with a funding line in the 30 percentile to understand why you didnt get a grant and why you might still be tenure able
9251266 if your field is one in which grant success is a common external measure of research quality discuss the candidates success in obtaining extramural funding other than unc chapel hill grant awards
9251267 a lot of universities in the u s except probably mit use traditional tools like microsoft oracle and sap
9251268 it is analysis that strikes me as having borne no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched
9251269 you cant tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued nsls to at amp t and verizon
9251270 now think real hard you been bird dogging this township awhile now they wouldnt mind a corpse of you now you could luxuriate in a nice jail cell but if your hand touches metal i swear by my pretty floral bonnet i will end you
9251271 if you take sexual advantage of her youre going to burn in a very special level of hell
9251272 what are you doing just rinse it off and put it back in
9251273 okay a virus is not alive but most cells are and any cells that are lacking a lot of parts well decide based on how much metabolism they do on their own
9251274 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9251275 sarah palin whose husband works for bp has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9251276 were soooo horny we cant keep our clothes on much longer
9251277 madam i have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life let us swear eternal friendship
9251278 what i remember most about the rocket were his eyes when he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick his eyes were all lit up flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine it was terrifying
9251279 either john mccain thinks the war on terror isnt serious or he thinks the vice presidency isnt since the former is obviously untrue it must be the latter
9251280 the most important thing about a vice presidential candidate as with a presidential candidate is fitness to be president
9251281 the toilet was full of filthy mud coloured water a man was relieving himself just outside the toilet and there was this frail woman with a jharoo desperately trying to clean it
9251282 der sturm ist so stark und gewinnt jeden tag mehr an st rke
9251283 senator biden has been a consistent supporter of the brady campaign
9251284 senator biden was a key player in the fight for the federal assault weapons ban that passed in 1994 he also worked hard for passage of the brady law sic
9251285 senator biden has been a consistent supporter of the brady campaign
9251286 senator biden was a key player in the fight for the federal assault weapons ban that passed in 1994 he also worked hard for passage of the brady law sic
9251287 john mccain hit it out of the park with his selection of governor palin
9251288 this is a bold fresh and exciting choice that clearly demonstrates that republicans arent reading from a script but giving the nation a real choice between an inexperienced senator running with a washington insider versus a true independent minded maverick american hero running with a successful and dynamic female executive a conservative and a reformer who couldnt be further from washington as usual
9251289 sarah palin has more executive experience than obama and biden combined
9251290 this is exactly the kind of reform and real change we need in washington
9251291 i congratulate governor sarah palin on being selected to serve as senator john mccains vice presidential running mate governor palin has an impressive personal story and a record of effective service in state and local government her service in elected office has reflected a consistent commitment to conservative principles and a desire to reform government and make it work for families and businesses governor palins addition to the republican ticket will give us a unique opportunity to reach out to many undecided voters in the weeks leading up to the november election
9251292 governor sarah palin is a proven and consistent conservative a strong supporter of limited government and low taxes a lifelong friend of the second amendment an advocate for the right to life a proven foe of corruption bureaucracy and out of control spending committed to critically needed domestic energy production a mother of five and if elected she will be the first vice president since teddy roosevelt who enjoys moose hunting governor palin is the future of our party and she is the future of america elections are about the future and this choice today ensures a forward looking republican ticket that will resonate with voters from fairbanks to fort lauderdale and from chincoteague to the cumberland gap
9251293 governor sarah palin brings a strong conservative pro taxpayer and pro life record to the republican ticket she is a reformer with results and her executive experience compliments john mccains military service
9251294 sarah palins reforms in alaska go hand in hand with john mccains maverick record in the u s senate on cutting spending and reigning in the out of control federal budget governor palin brings a record of executive leadership and reform that the democratic ticket completely lacks neither obama nor biden have a single shred of executive or military experience the harvard law review simply isnt enough to qualify one for president of the united states
9251295 governor palin also adds an obvious benefit that senator joe biden cant possibly provide namely that shes held jobs in the private sector sometime in the last 35 years
9251296 sarah palin is a strong vice presidential pick that represents a fresh breath of air for those looking for representation in this election and someone who will make a difference in washington dc as a soon to be mom myself i admire what sarah palin has been able to achieve as both a professional executive rising to the level of governor as well as being a mom of five children with three daughters one son off to iraq in only a few weeks and a baby boy with the challenges of downs syndrome she has been a successful manager both of a state and her family one of the issues important to me is the pain we all face at the pump there is no one that knows the issue of rising oil prices and how we can solve this problem better than someone who knows alaska and its issues like sarah palin lastly i cant stop thinking of the irony that hillary clinton was able to get so many women excited about politics and what a woman could do but it is the republican party not the democrat party that is leading the way and elevating a smart and qualified woman like sarah palin to its 2008 ticket to win the white house i feel confident that governor palin should be able to carry on the mantle left to her by geraldine ferraros 1984 run connect with women as a new and refreshing face and close the deal to help us win in 2008 as a young professional and mom to be i am looking forward to campaigning for the mccain palin ticket
9251297 the consignment of the trinity to theological and spiritual irrelevance
9251298 according to rahner the word and only the word could have become flesh because in the divine processions of the trinity the word and not the holy spirit is the real symbolic expression of the father
9251299 the procession of the son from the father is moreover a reality connected necessarily with the divine self knowledge without which gods absolute act of cognitional self possession is impossible
9251300 if the father is to reveal himself to humans in time this revelation must take place in and through the word who is the perfect symbolic expression of the father
9251301 a nature which is by its essence an openness to god
9251302 required the mediator of god and humans through his kinship to both presenting humanity to god revealing god to humanity
9251303 is a history of enduring the consequences of sin as well as a history of salvation
9251304 imperfect sort of death which is the consequence of sin
9251305 rahner claims that the passive sort of death is not so much a punishment imposed externally by god rather it is the intrinsic consequence of sin
9251306 universal fact of death shapes each human life and makes it into a history
9251307 made in life are made definitive by death because rahner asserts eternity is not the infinite continuation of time but the timeless consummation or fulfillment of time
9251308 criticizes religious theories which allow for second chances in a world beyond or in reincarnation into this world on the grounds that they devalue decisions made before death
9251309 the creatures sinful act while it does indeed involve total disaster for the creature itself is nevertheless incapable of leaving the field of gods ultimate will the will by which god wills gods glory
9251310 freest possible love because god could have refrained from this and been happy in godself
9251311 to such an extent that this transfiguration occurs and continues as the creatures total acceptance of being divinely accepted in freedom
9251312 the son of god became the son of man so that through him we might receive adoption
9251313 unambiguous goal of the movement of creation as a whole in relation to which everything prior is merely a preparation of the scene theological 165
9251314 what is exterior to god is never in itself resolved into an ultimate all embracing harmony
9251315 the salvific history of the world is then a unity and at its center is christ
9251316 consummation or salvation is the gracious fulfillment of the human relationship with god in which the individual will be related to god in knowledge and love
9251317 rahner rejects the theory of satisfaction according to which god forgives mens sins only by means of the infinite satisfaction of the god man on the cross
9251318 because sin is in his view an infinite offence against god
9251319 what happens in saving history is not the natural outcome of some unchanging ideal law but the free incalculable ever new event of gods activity
9251320 physically indissolubly linked in the humanity of jesus with god
9251321 we are saved and redeemed because jesus and in him god accepted this ultimate impotence of death a powerlessness that can only be accepted in trust or rejected in despair and because this acceptance began with the incarnation and was made definitive in death
9251322 in death christs human nature becomes the unique bond linking the material universe and all humans in it to the father in a relationship of eternal reconciliation
9251323 the resurrection was not the beginning of a new period in the life of jesus which was filled with something new and different that continued time but a continuation of the same unique and unrepeatable life now made definitive as jesus made his life definitive and lasting by his free death in obedience
9251324 jesus obedient acceptance of death which began with the incarnation itself
9251325 jesus crucifixion brings about humanitys salvation because the climax of human impotence is combined with absolute trust in the father whether or not this might have been manifested in a different death or if jesus had died differently must remain a matter for purely theoretical speculation
9251326 concerned with the freely achieved final end of the subject as such
9251327 rahner is very clear that god is both the gift of salvation and that which makes the acceptance of the gift possible
9251328 continuing responsible freedom of humanity is enslaved by the demonic powers of sin and death and even by the law and it must be freed to the love of the law by the grace of god
9251329 gods activity in the course of saving history is not a kind of monologue which god conducts by godself it is a long dramatic dialogue between god and gods creature in which god confers of humans the power to make a genuine answer to gods word
9251330 divine grace is the fundamental cause of salvation people must do something to accept that grace in such a way that it transforms them
9251331 human freedom is not absolute autonomy in other words freedom from god but rather living in the manner for which humanity was created a life in and with god freedom in god
9251332 seems to be heading towards an ultimate and inevitable positive resolution universal salvation but this conflicts with his frequent insistence that humans can reject god
9251333 the threat of eternal condemnation is real for all people but god will not necessarily actualize this possibility
9251334 rahner does not set out a formal argument for universal salvation even as a hope
9251335 gods central and saving definitive saving act one precisely for that reason different from all the others is the single inner unity of incarnation cross and resurrection in which god definitively and radically communicated godself to the world and in which god really came to us
9251336 intrinsically directed to christ as their end and every revealed word which enters into composition with them and accompanies them thus has intrinsic reference to the definitive and unsurpassable revelation of god in christ
9251337 the word of the old testament already possesses in actual fact an inner orientation to gods definitive word in and through christ
9251338 the transcendental quality that is distinctive to ones experience of god
9251339 god communicates gods self to or dwells in each and every human individual
9251340 circumspect about whether the consummation of gods self communication that is salvation will actually be achieved for every individual he is certain that that consummation is at least possible for all
9251341 gods offer of gods own self can be experienced in every aspect of each individuals worldly life and that the acceptance or rejection of god can be enacted in every aspect
9251342 karl rahner coined the phrase anonymous christians for those who participate in the divine grace and salvation through the universal logos in religious and moral systems other than christian
9251343 permits a generous estimate of what god is doing beyond the walls of the church and it offers a point of contact between biblical religion and the virtues and values of other religions
9251344 karl rahner has constructed his theory on the basis of the ancient patristic doctrine of the universal logos
9251345 the unfolding within human nature of the union of the human with the logos
9251346 the clearest formulations the most sanctified formulas the classic condensations of the centuries long work of the church in prayer reflection and struggle concerning gods mysteries
9251347 neither the abandonment of a formula nor its preservation in a petrified form does justice to human understanding
9251348 one can be sure that gods salvation is available for all and is already effective in some there can be no absolute certainty about the details of salvation who is saved and who is not what constitutes an acceptance or rejection of god whether all we be saved
9251349 the rightness and holiness of gods decision rests in itself alone precisely because it is free it is not to be traced back to some necessitating source which has the lucidity of necessity
9251350 i never thought youd be caught dead in a gap

9251440 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9251441 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9251442 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9251443 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9251444 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9251445 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans
9251446 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9251447 you see you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
9251448 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
9251449 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
9251450 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
9251451 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9251452 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9251453 you know unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america ill eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9251454 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9251455 we will do this washington washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9251456 and in that time he has said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day that senator mccain took office
9251457 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9251458 as president as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
9251459 wake up america we went into iraq for oil the oil companies want more
9251460 war against iran will mean 10 a gallon gasoline the oil administration wants to drill more into your wallet wake up america weapons contractors want more an iran war will cost 5 to 10 trillion dollars
9251461 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9251462 someone answers for me what is it exactly the vp does everyday
9251463 oversees oil and gas drilling development and production reservoir depletion and metering operations on all lands subject to the states police powers
9251464 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9251465 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9251466 i wish i could see you guys again but were not from around here we came into town for the mule show and you guys were way better than the mule show
9251467 so you know i was the one who taped your malibu barbie to that bottle rocket that time right
9251468 you remember that time i drew moustaches all over your new kids on the block posters
9251469 you know i was the one that ran off with your fairweather johnson cd right all three times
9251470 i was the one that put the frogs in your sleeping bag that time in yosemite
9251471 i was the one that pulled the strings on your halter top that day you flashed everyone at element
9251472 you knew i was the one wearing the jason mask the day we played that prank on you at mckinney falls and you ended up fainting right
9251473 i was the one that really lost the hotel reservation stuff when we were in germany not you

9251487 one of the great features of the desert enclosed red sea is that you can literally time travel from the present several hundred thousand years into the past
9251488 the overall decline in giant clam stocks with the striking loss of large specimens is a smoking gun indicating over harvesting
9251489 the coral reefs in particular may still harbour very large surprises
9251490 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
9251491 given that bats are far more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

9251497 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9251498 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9251499 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9251500 even though only 24 per cent of doctors trusted the information as much as an independent source most 81 per cent would rather receive it because it was often the only way to get timely information on new drugs
9251501 the survey of 180 doctors found that 73 per cent referred to pharmaceutical companies or their representatives for drug information this made the companies the second most important source for doctors after clinical evidence
9251502 drug companies are the main source of information for 16 per cent of doctors when deciding whether to prescribe a new drug the survey said
9251503 drug company marketing is often the only way you get information about new drugs in a timely fashion

9251582 pat buchanan brought his conservative message of a smaller government and an america first foreign policy to fairbanks and wasilla on friday as he continued a campaign swing through alaska buchanans strong message championing states rights resonated with the roughly 85 people gathered for an interior republican luncheon in fairbanks among those sporting buchanan buttons were wasilla mayor sarah palin and state sen jerry ward r anchorage
9251583 there are so many jobs that are up for grabs that i think that promotes good healthy competition at just about every position
9251584 there are a few guys who are pretty much a lock but with only five returning starters on defense and two on offense a lot of guys came into it thinking they were going to compete for what they had
9251585 were pretty much set offensively but were still picking and choosing a little bit on the cornerback position
9251586 that was the only thing we were looking at today
9251587 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9251588 it was a diner a local construction and fishermen hangout

9251591 everything we make is made from scratch we buy grass fed beef and we make our own stocks

9251593 we are in the preliminary stages but my head chef michael bild mother and i are looking at opening an organic farm
9251594 we want to grow for the restaurant and supply other restaurants as well
9251595 i still enjoy teaching even in the summer when i have much smaller classes
9251596 you had to be able to draw well then in printmaking we were focused on one skill it was myopic really you became very good at one thing
9251597 watercolor is the most popular medium in the world everybody tries it its very different from the small fraternity of people who make etchings
9251598 i can produce a painting in around 15 hours after two to three hours of drawing time
9251599 i take multiple photographs sometimes as many as 50 or 60 of the subject before beginning my drawing
9251600 the only difference that i can see is that illustration has an intent
9251601 when you start to try to talk about what youre doing it ends up sounding silly
9251602 sometimes i may only spend a few minutes there and sometimes i work for several hours
9251603 it has ruined themarket for original handmade art prints people dont understand what theyre buying
9251604 but i loved to draw from the time i was a kid it was the only thing i was really good at
9251605 holland is one of the great sports cities in michigan if you look at their interest in all the professional sports hope college and their high schools its a great place for sports

9251607 i like the local aspect of it hes very much michigan based
9251608 business has been a bit slow this year because of gas prices i believe
9251609 it costs twice as much to get out on the water
9251610 we had to increase the prices to keep up with the rising gas prices
9251611 i believe we raised them from 425 to 460 for a half day from 350 to 400 for an evening and from 475 to 550 for a full day
9251612 the gas is whats going to limit us as the gas prices go up we raise our prices
9251613 if this continues we will price ourselves right out of existence
9251614 nobody balks at the surcharge because they understand how it is
9251615 i hope gas gets settled down but if we have to keep raising rates we will
9251616 more people want shorter trips which is really uneconomical for us because we used the same amount of gas to get in and out of the lake
9251617 fishing has been fantastic charters are bringing in the limits every time limit being five fish per person
9251618 its becoming a rare exception that the folks are not hitting the limit
9251619 i feel like im back at my summer job i didnt know id be shoveling a six ton mound of mulch this morning
9251620 but its good for the community its a good sacrifice of sleep and i guess theres cold stone at the end of it
9251621 we really appreciate their effort they always work hard and the girls work harder than the boys
9251622 i dont know if we could have gotten it done without them
9251623 we also have hope students who help out with the classroom during the year theyre fantastic
9251624 they were inseparable they lived together for half a century effectively like husband and wife
9251625 there were repeated allegations during newmans lifetime about his circle of homosexual friends it is uncertain whether their relationship involved sex it is quite likely that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sexual relations but abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation

9251627 part of the established procedure prior to a beatification requires that if the body of the new beatus exists then it must be exhumed inspected and transferred to a place of honor befitting the persons new status
9251628 as a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself cardinal newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the holy see and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable

9251646 n o o caso isso simplesmente fazer malabarismo com os fatos uma mentira
9251647 eles precisavam de um inimigo externo e o ir n o se encaixava muito bem nesse papel e eles querem ressuscitar a r ssia como amea a

9251659 afortunado dir amos al final as como la vez pasada ante necaxa fue amargo ahora decimos que fue afortunado porque por lo menos se rescata el punto despu s del desarrollo que tuvimos en el segundo tiempo
9251660 siempre pasa esta situaci n vas ganando y entra un poquito la confianza no se sabe pero son descuidos el equipo trabaj bien para tener el marcador a favor sin embargo un par de descuidos provocan la reacci n del rival
9251661 no supimos mantener el marcador olvidamos que esto es de 90 95 minutos la verdad es que este empate nos deja un sabor amargo por c mo se dio el partido desafortunadamente al final nos empatan y tenemos que corregir esos errores
9251662 bien contentos sab amos que ven amos de recibir siete goles en dos partidos y que ten amos qu cambiar eso
9251663 hoy fuimos s lidos atr s el partido pasado tambi n y gracias a dios no recibimos goles esperemos que podamos seguir as d ndole confianza a todo el equipo
9251664 era el objetivo sab amos que ganando nos pon amos iguales de puntos sabemos que lo positivo mantuvimos el arco en cero supimos manejar el partido y eso significa que el equipo va mejorando
9251665 estamos bien vamos tranquilos partido tras partido y creo que de los errores se aprende
9251666 as como hace ocho d as ustedes dec an que no tra amos nada pues hoy tampoco somos los mejores creo que tenemos que trabajar para seguir arriba y s ser los mejores
9251667 ojala que sea el repunte porque el equipo hace bien las cosas hay que seguir en esa l nea para aspirar a la calificaci n lo antes posible
9251668 nos alcanzaron est n ah con nosotros pero no pasa nada porque a veces jugamos con un equipo a veces con otro todav a no tenemos el equipo completo y cuando est el equipo completo ya va a ser otra cosa
9251669 seguimos primero en el grupo no pasa nada est todo bien est todo tranquilo dolorosa la derrota porque es un rival de grupo un equipo de la regi n pero todo sigue
9251670 la verdad que no dirigi bien para ninguno de los dos lados pero bueno ya termin el partido hay que pensar en lo que viene perdimos el punto importante para nosotros nos alcanzaron as que hay que esperar y seguir que esto reci n empieza todav a falta la mitad del torneo y estamos bien dentro de todo
9251671 enseguida nos echaron creo que no hay comparaci n porque a los veinte minutos ya ten amos un hombre menos fue expulsado juan pablo rodr guez jugamos la mayor a del tiempo con un hombre menos y obviamente no es lo mismo
9251672 la liguilla ya pas ellos hab an dicho que era otra cosa nos alcanzaron vienen de ganar dos partidos seguidos as que bueno ojal les siga yendo bien y ojal nos vaya bien a nosotros
9251673 la selecci n es lo que viene y ojal que sean cosas buenas y que obtengamos el triunfo contra jamaica y canad
9251674 voy con mucha ilusi n de aportar despu s el t cnico decidir qui n juega y qui n no es un compromiso muy importante nos jugamos cosas importantes podemos definir un poquito quiz la primera parte y ojal que sean cosas buenas y lo importante es que m xico est en el mundial lo antes posible
9251675 creo que nos afect mucho eso y el equipo hizo todo lo que pudo lamentablemente no se pudo monterrey estuvo muy bien parado y no dej chance como para poder crearle una situaci n de gol
9251676 era un partido de rival de grupo y el equipo quiere jugar bien quiere ser protagonista y lo est demostrando el partido pasado se demostr un buen futbol y ahora aqu en nuestra cancha no dejamos ir al rival
9251677 bien contento pero estoy un poco molesto por las situaciones de gol que fall nada m s de eso vivimos los delanteros todos queremos anotar todas las que tengamos y a veces es muy complicado meter todas pero hay que seguir intentando y los goles caen
9251678 la verdad s son dos partidos y seis puntos y muy contento m s que nada por c mo se jug
9251679 esperemos que sea el repunte queremos ser protagonistas queremos que el equipo ande bien todos queremos que el monterrey ande bien se juegue bien y que guste
9251680 se est jugando como se termin el torneo pasado el equipo est encontrando un buen nivel y la verdad estoy muy contento por como se est haciendo y muy contento por el gol de william paredes que est siendo un jugador muy importante para el equipo y tambi n ruiz hiber
9251681 estoy motivado y con muchas ganas de poder aportar de poder jugar y esperemos la decisi n que tome el entrenador si no nos toca jugar hay que seguir apoyando porque hay que ir al mundial
9251682 se nos fue un poquito la mala suerte porque el partido con tecos no se merec a perder para nada hubo una expulsi n fueron muy r pidos los goles el d a del partido contra cruz azul llev bamos dos a cero arriba y lamentablemente nos lo sacaron tambi n del bolsillo
9251683 y ahora recuperamos porque se gan afuera con necaxa y se gana hoy con un equipo que es santos por algo es el campe n y son seis puntos muy importantes ya estamos ah y lo que hab amos perdido creo que ya recuperamos bastante
9251684 ellos dentro de la cancha sab an que no hab a que dejar agrandar a un equipo como es santos un equipo muy importante y mantuvieron lo m s importante en el futbol el cero atr s
9251685 se buscaban variantes las variantes siempre tienen que estar se arranc el campeonato con una idea se los dije a ellos un poquito demasiado ofensivo haber jugado con borgetti suazo ochoa y arellano era mucho en punta y poca recuperaci n en la media cancha
9251686 se trat y se vio que los resultados no estaban a la altura y uno ten a que salir lamentablemente le toc a borgetti como le pudo haber tocado a suazo a ochoa al que sea los tres est n bien y los tres tienen que demostrar qui nes son los dos nueves porque no juego m s con tres porque haber jugado con tres perd puntos
9251687 un equipo que ten a un hombre de m s se gan dos a cero con el cero atr s sin apremio y era buscar los tres puntos sea c mo sea
9251688 el equipo aguant muy bien fue inteligente y si hubi ramos tenido en esos contragolpes la definici n justa hubi ramos goleado

9251702 ye cannot eat of the lords table and the table of devils
9251703 profane persons feast with their sins yet will come to feast at the lords table
9251704 all things work for good to them that love god
9251705 we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world
9251706 the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord
9251707 herein is my father glorified that ye bring forth much fruit
9251708 yet not i but the grace of god which was with me

9251710 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
9251711 i was found by those who did not seek me i was made manifest to those who did not ask for me
9251712 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me

9251754 ive been calling this matchup for two years now just for one
9251755 creo que el equipo cada vez se ve mejor en el primer tiempo mostr un futbol vertical con jugadas de uno o dos toques que realmente cada vez me entusiasma m s estos son los partidos en los que hubiera sido otro tr mite de meter la mitad de las ocasiones que se generaron al final se complic porque necaxa es un equipo ordenado
9251756 zeballos cada vez se ve mejor pero la mayor a ya ha estado y han tenido continuidad y por consecuencia viene lo mejor de ellos y saben que pueden dar mucho m s y as debe de ser realmente cualquiera puede jugar hay una competencia sana y nadie se debe echar a dormir porque en cualquier momento pueden jugar est n mostrando el futbol que deseo y me deja contento el funcionamiento ya que fuimos los mejores sin embargo hay que seguir trabajando en la definici n
9251757 yo creo que la afici n simpre nos ha apoyado y conforme pasa el torneo el equipo est haciendo su esfuerzo y sacando resultados creo que al final la gente ver que el equipo ser protagonista y superior a su rival

9251813 cest tellement extraordinaire que cela se passe de commentaires lame est ce qui permet aux trangers en situation irr guli re d viter de mourir faute de soins effectivement il faudrait peut tre r server le droit de vivre aux fran ais cest une interpr tation de la pr f rence nationale qui va plus loin que ce que le fn lui m me a imagin mettre en balance la lutte contre la pauvret des fran ais et le droit la vie des trangers cela rel ve du cynisme le plus profond il y a une grande diversit de points de vue au figaro mais concernant cet dito je cherche des pr c dents le figaro crit ce que minute n crivait pas la france a d j t condamn e par le conseil de leurope apr s une tentative de suppression de lame par le gouvernement villepin en 2005 ensuite un deuxi me texte a retir aux trangers sans papiers le droit de se soigner normalement ils doivent se contenter des urgences en cas de n cessit je pense que tout cela est assez r v lateur dun glissement g n ral sur les valeurs que nous observons m me si on franchit l un cap dans le cynisme explicite en affirmant quil faut faire payer les trangers pour les plus pauvres on prend le risque dencourager les attitudes violentes dans certaines franges de la population qui pourraient se tromper de col re et je ne peux pas imaginer que le figaro lignore

9251815 cet dito refl te beaucoup de stupidit et de haine de soi la proposition est dabord particuli rement stupide en termes de sant publique lame est un outil indispensable et son acc s a d j t r duit ces deux derni res ann es elle sadresse aux personnes en situation irr guli re sur le territoire depuis au moins 3 mois et qui gagnent moins de 600 euros ces personnes nont pas acc s la pr vention et peuvent souffrir de pathologies assez lourdes la suppression de lame pourrait provoquer la r surgence de certaines maladies quon croyait radiqu es comme la tuberculose ensuite le chiffre cit pour le co t de lame 800 millions deuros est faux ce qui est assez tonnant de la part dun journaliste de ce niveau les rapports de linspection g n rale des finances et de linspection g n rale des affaires sociales de 2007 le prouvent enfin cest une r gression totale sur le plan moral devant laquelle on ne peut tre queffar l dito exprime une position qui est traditionnellement celle de lextr me droite le pr sident de la r publique a fait un coup gauche en annon ant un financement du rsa par une taxe sur le capital les propagandistes du fn r agissent je ne pensais pas en trouver au figaro qui plus est lier la suppression de lame celle du financement de laudiovisuel ext rieur comme le fait yves de kerdrel cest dire clairement replions nous sur nous m mes il y a bien dautres moyens de financer en partie le rsa pourquoi ne pas cr er une taxe sur les jeux de hasard
9251816 quun journaliste du figaro dise que pour venir en aide aux d munis il faut sattaquer aux plus d munis cela m tonne moyennement cependant je ne pense pas que les fran ais acceptent ce sch ma de pens e quand yves de kerdrel parle de coup port une fois de plus ceux qui cr ent des richesses il faut souligner que les sans papiers qui travaillent eux aussi cr ent des richesses je vois a plut t comme une bavure quautre chose en effet nicolas sarkozy vient de faire quelque chose de fort pour une fois il prend largent l o il faut pour le donner aux d munis la droite nappr cie pas yves de kerdrel attaque les pr caires l o ils sont les plus pr caires cest aberrant
9251817 manifestement yves de kerdrel est mal inform lame co te 500 et non 800 millions selon le rapport de linspection g n rale des affaires sociales igas de 2007 sa suppression serait totalement irresponsable en termes de sant publique dabord on augmenterait la d pense en emp chant lacc s aux soins surtout supprimer la couverture maladie des plus pauvres parmi les plus pauvres cest retirer un m canisme de protection sociale de lordre de la survie il est tout aussi irresponsable de dire que les travailleurs en situation irr guli re ne cr ent pas de richesses cest le contraire ils cotisent et ne peuvent tre assur s depuis 2002 cest tous les ans quil y a des tentatives pour supprimer lame notamment au parlement lors du vote des lois de finance ce nest quune attaque de plus mais celle ci est frontale
9251818 on assiste au sempiternel processus qui consiste d shabiller jacques pour habiller paul les travailleurs sans papiers payent d j des cotisations sans b n ficier des droits qui vont avec cest parfaitement scandaleux les demandeurs de lame font face des situations dextr me pr carit cest un climat malsain qui sinstalle une comp tition la pr carit ou la richesse bient t un pr caire fran ais se trouvera mis en comp tition avec un pr caire sans papiers lobjectif est clairement de briser les solidarit s en encourageant cette logique dopposition yves de kerdrel n crit pas par hasard il ny a pas de fum e sans feu il pourrait bien tre un poisson pilote du gouvernement

9251822 nasas hubble space telescope image of galaxy ngc 1275 reveals fine thread like filamentary structures in the gas surrounding the galaxy the red filaments are composed of cool gas being suspended by a magnetic field and are surrounded by the 100 million degree fahrenheit hot gas in the center of the perseus galaxy cluster the filaments are dramatic markers of the feedback process through which energy is transferred from a central supermassive black hole to the surrounding gas the filaments originate when cool gas is transported from the center of the galaxy by radio bubbles that rise in the hot interstellar gas astronomers have resolved individual threads of gas which make up the filaments the amount of gas contained in a typical thread is around one million times the mass of our own sun they are only 200 light years wide are often very straight and extend for up to 20 000 light years

9251828 el 1 de diciembre de 1974 en mi tucum n natal presenci el episodio m s desdichado de mi vida fue un hecho cruel espantoso doloroso atentaron contra mi familia en un ataque inesperado y artero terroristas del erp ej rcito revolucionario del pueblo asesinaron a mi esposo capit n humberto antonio viola y a mi hija mar a cristina de 3 a os

9251832 adujo tambi n a los organismos de derechos humanos de qu derechos humanos me hablaba yo no lo escuch jam s ni cuando asesinaron a cristina tampoco en las operaciones de fernanda y mucho menos cuando luciana naci sin pap me pregunto los asesinatos de humberto y cristina no se consideran de lesa humanidad

9251840 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the medical stimuli conference market area forward
9251841 the last thing i want to do is send people home because thats against our companys mission statement
9251842 and also because we can reallocate our human capital to work on other projects that will be beneficial while the consumer market slows down
9251843 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
9251844 im excited about the future possibilities in our medical stimuli conference industry
9251845 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
9251846 we can weather the economic down turn by saving our liquid capital down sizing and then bursting out when things turnaround for the better
9251847 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the medical stimuli conference consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions
9251848 i saw this coming luckily i know my job is safe and if worse comes to worse ill retire early and live off a modest pension organized labor is not concerned either since many medical stimuli conference syndicates hashed out reasonable deals with corporate leadership last year
9251849 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our medical stimuli conference market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
9251850 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
9251851 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real
9251852 and we found that those who played using more sophisticated real life like software tended to react more intensely to the act of wagering much like our other patients who were wagering in an actual physical casino
9251853 we found a very different pattern of brain activity when users placed bets at
9251854 of all the sports we observed baseball betting showed the lowest level of brain activity baseball is a much slower and relaxed game so this is expected on the other hand those engaged in showed significantly higher numbers because basketball is a much faster game
9251855 i want better health insurance and medical stimuli conference training seminars
9251856 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers

9251860 of all the sports we observed baseball betting showed the lowest level of brain activity baseball is a much slower and relaxed game so this is expected on the other hand those engaged in showed significantly higher numbers because basketball is a much faster game
9251861 were thrilled by these sales god knows we need them
9251862 the end of the season has been slow and without much publicity about the best sellers now we have to literally close early because we are running out of stock
9251863 i for one plan to buy the book long after the initial sales rush is over
9251864 when everyone is rushing in at once taking little time to actually review the work we tend to move too quickly to judgment you have to be careful especially when considering the breadth of the medical stimuli conference industry
9251865 stephanie lausiers book brings many important points about the medical stimuli conference world into focus
9251866 and i myself plan to buy a copy and study it in depth its not often that we come across such a thorough and lucid analysis of medical stimuli conference industry and design
9251867 this book has something for everyone there is a good true story a little suspense solid fact and a great critical analysis of medical stimuli conference operation in moder society
9251868 this is really showing people that the medical stimuli conference business world is not elitist but really consumer friendly thoughtful and dynamic with these new views the medical stimuli conference companies of today and tomorrow can move forward
9251869 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
9251870 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real
9251871 and we found that those who played using more sophisticated real life like software tended to react more intensely to the act of wagering much like our other patients who were wagering in an actual physical casino

9251874 with the recent boom in the medical stimuli conference market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
9251875 our hr department is by far the largest unit at destiny jiang inc
9251876 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
9251877 and we realize that as a result we provide new medical stimuli conference business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
9251878 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
9251879 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in medical stimuli conference marketing on the internet
9251880 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
9251881 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
9251882 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
9251883 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers
9251884 the brain scan results showed consistent patterns of arousal and frontal lobe stimulus which suggests that sports betting gamblers dont necessarily react to their physical environments but more from the actual act of placing a bet virtual or for real

9251888 im happy to see that my collegue henning brownstein believes in this project
9251889 this project will help all involved greatly and will move things forward dramatically
9251890 i want to get on board as soon as possible but my risk tolerance in the medical stimuli conference industry is much lower than others ill join after first quarter profits are reported to stock markets and investors
9251891 because my experience has been that medical stimuli conference companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because medical stimuli conference consumers like those found on www ensembl org or www info gov are not ready for a new paradigm
9251892 coakley thielemier is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe medical stimuli conference business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www dhhs gov for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our medical stimuli conference knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of defelice olivarria of www nrc gov we are sure to turn a profit
9251893 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
9251894 i want this medical stimuli conference project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this medical stimuli conference event is a great start
9251895 we examined a sub set of patients who indicated they were frequent gamblers who used both brick and mortar casinos and online gaming centers

9251900 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
9251901 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9251902 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
9251903 dayum she looks intellectual trustful and loyal im going to go talk to her
9251904 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9251905 heyy im going to your school this year we sooo have to hang out
9251906 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9251907 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9251908 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9251909 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9251910 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9251911 if the people we love are stolen from us the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them
9251912 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
9251913 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
9251914 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
9251915 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves
9251916 i will not raise taxes on the people of california
9251917 look i cut to the chase i know what the democrats like and i know what the republicans like so i say lets meet somewhere in the middle
9251918 the purple panel traps will not bring emerald ash borers into a noninfested site
9251919 these traps help us determine if the pest is already there
9251920 but theyre an unusual native species and their resurgence is an indication of how clean our rivers have become
9251921 gar are exciting to catch theyll even tail walk and jump when you get this mean looking creature up into the air its a thrilling thing but its definitely not for everybody
9251922 i make a loop out of it and tie it to a jig head then clip off the hook so the rope becomes both the attractor and the hook
9251923 when you feel the gar chewing on the rope its an odd sensation you tug on it it takes some getting used to because theres no setting the hook
9251924 you cant just cut the cord to release the fish or its beak will remain tied shut and it will starve to death
9251925 a lot of guys dont like gar because they allegedly steal bait
9251926 youll hear stories of guys breaking their beaks or throwing them up onto banks theyre a nuisance species
9251927 gar are no more predatory than any other game fish and have a definite place in the ecosystem
9251928 lets hope that de listing them will be an opportunity to educate anglers
9251929 back then that was a lot of money it cost 12 cents to go to a movie
9251930 and you could go back to the same place every year and there would be another groundhog there cows would step in their holes and break their legs farmers wanted them out
9251931 what ive done more of than anything else i used to live it
9251932 their adaptability parallels that of coyotes adults can defend themselves so its not quite as easy for predators to kill them and their home range is small less than a quarter mile so you could have many in one big field
9251933 they mow down alfalfa clover soybeans and corn when its young and really impact commercial and backyard gardens
9251934 and their burrowing is hard on farm animals machinery and erosion of the field all of that together thats why theres an open season on groundhogs in pennsylvania
9251935 a lot of farm shooting is done in the prone or kneeling position
9251936 so shoulders dont absorb the heavier recoil of larger bore rifles without some discomfort i like the smaller calibers
9251937 light recoil extended range over other centerfire 22s and extremely accurate with consistent hits on woodchuck out to 250 or 300 yards
9251938 there are other bullets out there for varmints but i liked the 22 250 for dual use
9251939 lighter bullets are less reliable its simple physics next in order of preference is the 243 it will hold the wind a little better
9251940 minimize the sizing on brass and youre going to have more consistent internal volume which always affects pressures
9251941 the more consistent you can make pressure the more consistent your velocity will be and the gun will shoot more accurately
9251942 the most important thing in a successful deer hunt is the ability to put time into zeroing in the gun
9251943 theres no reason to change the sighting for groundhogs pick shots you might take for deer if youre shooting 1 inch high at 100 yards youre covering yourself at long ranges
9251944 avanci on avanci la llengua catalana tots en sortim beneficiats i per tant el govern de catalunya actua desacomplexadament com ho fan tots els governs del m n en suport de la seva llengua
9251945 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington

9251947 if carrots got you drunk rabbits would be f cked up
9251948 the real presence slips past our demand for spectacle it slips past our despair not just like a child sometimes it is a child she walks down the blistered steps to where you kneel and says the simplest things she is entertained by butterflies she has opinions about unicorns she does not seem to care that you are ruined and lost she does not even seem to notice find an earthworm in the neglected loam and she will make you feel for a moment that your life has not been wasted name a flower and she will make you feel that you have begun to learn to speak

9251950 after a detailed review of the determination by nepra the prime minister in consultation with finance minister syed naveed qamar and minister for water and power raja pervaiz ashraf allowed a 31 per cent increase in power tariff
9251951 it is for the first time in the recent history of the country that power tariff is being increased by 31 per cent
9251952 there will be no increase in power tariff for consumers who consume only 50 units but those who consume more than 50 units will now have to pay huge bills
9251953 it is very disappointing that pakistan hasnt played a test match this year i dont think such a thing has happened to any country in the past
9251954 we would have played at least three tests had australia toured pakistan but it is very sad that we are having a year without tests the more test matches in pakistan the better for the country since test cricket is the real test of a players temperament and skill
9251955 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9251956 were excited that some of our favorite artists can be featured in rock band as a result of this pack
9251957 calling attention to pax artists and giving back to the community at the same time show why harmonix is truly a company focused on the music and their fans above all else
9251958 were excited that some of our favorite artists can be featured in rock band as a result of this pack

9251961 ooh i want to watch fletch at 3 am on a weeknight
9251962 its like the old make your own icards feature on steroids and a whole lot easier to use in the bargain
9251963 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9251964 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9251965 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9251966 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9251967 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9251968 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9251969 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9251970 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9251971 transform our community and our world with the gospel of jesus christ
9251972 in a paper published in june they researchers suggested that our unconscious bias is a byproduct of more adaptive instincts the features that make a face strike us as trustworthy if exaggerated make a face look happy with arching inner eyebrows and upturned mouths and an exaggerated untrustworthy face looks angry with a furrowed brow and frown in this argument people with trustworthy faces simply have by the luck of the genetic draw faces that look a little more cheerful to us
9251973 wed be up to our waist in water here and it would be navigable
9251974 you could come out here with boats all the fishermen would be up and down with their fishing gear and pulling in the catch
9251975 but this is the middle of winter and it looks like a desert
9251976 this area is on the very brink of environmental collapse
9251977 you see the lack of birds and the lack of life you smell it you can smell the water if you walk out into the lake bed you can burn your feet because of the acid sulphates
9251978 its very real and its happening right in front of us
9251979 to see my parents on the day that the animals left all they could see was everything that weve worked for for 30 years going down the track its also my future going down the track
9251980 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9251981 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9251982 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9251983 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim

9251992 you gotta go wash the stamp off and then you can come back in
9251993 the doctor says ive got two years to 20 to live so i figure ive got 10 years
9251994 gerald mazer patient under my care cannot work he was recently diagnosed with leukemia
9251995 its almost been a year since i was diagnosed but im doing fine im trying to stay out of trouble the cops pretty much have been leaving me alone
9251996 for me d e a t h thats between seven and 10 years now if im lucky you never know because its up to god
9251997 i dont even think about the death sentence but its changed my philosophy about how i want to be right with god and right with people where im not a bad guy so maybe i can go to heaven
9251998 like yesterday i asked somebody for a down payment on a cheeseburger and i got no results so then i asked somebody for a down payment on a hippie burger and he called the cops and said i called him a hippie mother something it didnt sit too well with the cops but they let me get out of here
9251999 but that was from october of last year and i havent been arrested since
9252000 its better to be humble than to go to jail because if somebody calls the cops no matter what happened im the one who gets in trouble
9252001 make sure you put my diagnosis in the paper that way maybe people wont be so mean to me
9252002 i just didnt get selected for the team if they called me id be ready to play
9252003 i want to win rookie of the year at age 40
9252004 you have also the uncertainty of the economy and what that will mean for membership
9252005 the corporate community here is very generous but may hit hard times
9252006 were never going to give up the education agenda thats our no 1 goal thats not on the table
9252007 we traded staying open thursday evening for the general public for tuesday its a good day for schools
9252008 we could bump up parking or put admission back in but that cuts into your mission
9252009 we insist that in our democracy children be educated in certain fundamental achievements in humankind that open access to the high achievements of humankind must be extended to the arts i would rather take hits elsewhere than give up free admission
9252010 art in the age of steam europe america and the railway 1830 1960
9252011 they only select 11 features into the dances with films fest from a countless amount submitted
9252012 to even be in the festival was an honor and to win the grand jury is beyond words
9252013 think about how long it took really authentic rock music to make it into the theater
9252014 it wasnt until hair which was the 60s so thats 15 or more years since the rise of rock nroll
9252015 what i wanted to do was bring young people into the theater and get them excited about the theater and thats where hip hop comes in
9252016 it is the language of a generation it is incredibly potent right now
9252017 the ability to rhyme something within something else and then have it circle around on itself and have it rhyme with itself again is something that was absolutely mystifying to me as a listener of hip hop when i was young
9252018 and then as i got older the ability to marry that that sort of wordsmithery with actually being able to tell a story was extremely enlightening to me
9252019 what hip hop is at its core is just an extremely flexible art form
9252020 it can hold my rock music and your country music it can tell my story in new york it can tell your story in kansas city it can tell my story in the suburbs it can tell someone elses story on the streets
9252021 i was born in 1980 so ive never had a time when hip hop didnt exist in some form or another
9252022 you know hip hop was used to sell us breakfast cereal
9252023 hadnt lost their bedouin birthright even though for most of them the countrys dark wells of petroleum would always be more compelling than its topside
9252024 its designed for the working artists in the community but well also be offering printmaking classes for the public
9252025 there is no resource for printmakers unless you take a class at an area college
9252026 ive always been interested in americanisms im asking people to take time to think about what were told is of value to us
9252027 people can get close and feel the strong wind on their faces and their hair
9252028 the american ideal of life is under a certain amount of stress from other ideas
9252029 its not what it was 20 years ago i think our self concept has changed
9252030 get focused about what really matters in a democratic society
9252031 the flag is an event not a flat piece of cloth or a lapel pin
9252032 what is animal what is human and what is civilized behavior
9252033 david ford brings experience as a working artist and crossroads pioneer both of which are invaluable as the city and its dynamic art community progress
9252034 they want somebody whos going to go in and question some stuff
9252035 i think they want to get some more teeth in and well have to see how it goes
9252036 i wasnt looking to change jobs but this opportunity presented itself
9252037 its a remarkable opportunity with the new bolender center around the corner and the new performing arts center and things happening for the symphony and the opera
9252038 experience knowledge and manner with the public students parents and other teachers
9252039 to add more classes during the daytime and expand the school overall
9252040 i hope to be expanding classes at 1616 broadway the ballets current home over the next couple of years
9252041 im a strong believer in dance education whether students go on professionally or not
9252042 when i talk with parents and former students they understand discipline tenacity they understand self pride and confidence those are things dance study has afforded them
9252043 i plan to bring some of that into minicamp and master class
9252044 the citizens of kansas city should commend themselves for taking such a vested interest in the arts
9252045 it speaks well for a community that they see themselves as very well rounded
9252046 you know i planned this very eloquent rapping speech that was literally between me and my shower i didnt perform it for anyone i just practiced in the shower the week before the tonys
9252047 i used to dream about this moment but now im in it
9252048 you can actually see the moment where the written stuff leaves me right about where i say i dont believe in god but i believe in chris jackson
9252049 and then everyone starts screaming and then you just see panic in my face the rest of the stuff i just pulled out of my butt
9252050 i dont know about god but i believe in chris jackson
9252051 i dont know what else i got im off the dome i know i wrote a little show about home mr sondheim look i made a hat where there never was a hat a latin hat at that
9252052 im doing eight shows a week i havent had time

9252059 if you fly over the border and look on the colombian side all you see is coca crops
9252060 while the ecuadorean side is nothing but thick jungle with cocaine labs hidden under the canopy
9252061 its no trouble for a colombian to become an ecuadorean
9252062 you can buy an ecuadorean id card for about 70 90 depending how fast you need it
9252063 lago agrio has been a center of rendezvous supply and refuge for the farc
9252064 most of our site is written analytically hes writing it very personally and its getting positive feedback
9252065 the average person would be amazed at how many people read the web in the middle of the night
9252066 has been one of the pleasant surprises of the convention
9252067 what you send out via twitter has to have some news value
9252068 if theyre following you for journalistic reasons they will not follow you unless you have a very good track record of quality tweets
9252069 we found that the professional quality videos that we can lift from youtube are better than the ones we can produce ourselves at this point
9252070 theres been more buzz about her being here than her actually posting on the web site
9252071 filmmakers dont work on a daily or an hourly deadline

9252074 you know every night we send a pretty good pitcher to the mound a lot of times those games are going to flow your way
9252075 we can make an 8 1 game as exciting as anything in the world
9252076 we do probably have to find out what we can do to be a little more consistent than we have been
9252077 weve got to come out sunday and win too we cant lose that many more games and we know that
9252078 a walkoff anything ranks high because that means your team wins the game
9252079 you load the bases and hopefully you get a groundball and give your infielders a chance to go home and maybe turn two if its hit hard enough
9252080 you just have to keep working working working and eventually its going to turn around
9252081 i hit him with two strikes so i actually did him a favor
9252082 the best way to respond is with the bats and we did
9252083 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
9252084 there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary rodham clinton was treated
9252085 ive spent a lot of time over the last 24 years saying gosh i wish i werent the only one

9252089 una preocupaci n que hemos tenido durante muchos a os es que debido a que m s hombres acuden a nosotros en busca de ayuda las mujeres han tenido una tendencia a perderse en nuestro ministerio
9252090 estamos poniendo en marcha este ministerio porque queremos ofrecer ayuda espec fica que responda a las necesidades de las mujeres afectadas por la homosexualidad no deseada
9252091 la iglesia cristiana debe ser un lugar en donde se transmita poderosamente un sentimiento verdadero y compasivo a las mujeres heridas
9252092 mi meta es ayudar a m s mujeres a encontrar una esperanza real y ayudar que el camino hacia la plenitud de su feminidad esta en cristo y para equipar a otros a hacer lo mismo a otras lesbianas
9252093 you are a quality human being and a man of character
9252094 i may not be smarter than a fifth grader but i know when to take the money and run
9252095 commercial support for cme is pretty much dead and thats a good thing
9252096 3 000 civilians are slowly gathering and forming as an armed group
9252097 fo rming vigilante groups may expose civilians to harassments and violations of their human rights
9252098 protecting civilians does not mean arming them security forces of the philippine government already have that role
9252099 if the ilagas are going to substantiate their threats that would certainly exacerbate the situation but it might also prove terminal to the milf leaders because the ilaga are composed of christian settlers who are determined to defend their settlements against what they look upon as marauders they do not agree with the milf or mnlf members that these members have the sovereign right to their homeland they believe that it is the ilagas who have their homeland in mindanao because they were the original settlers there this is basically an argument over who came there first
9252100 community based and will not be allowed to enter other villages
9252101 vigilantes and the indiscriminate arming of civilians are not allowed
9252102 weve taken public positions which forced the president into the surge which is working
9252103 everybody probably likes their motorcycle the best but its interesting to see what other people have done
9252104 its a nice way to get a tattoo but its not permanent
9252105 im a postal contractor and this is a contract station
9252106 the lady who owns this building said the first floor could be mine
9252107 people come in later and sometimes when they see me in here they ask if they can get their packages so im like yeah well i guess its been a challenge
9252108 walking back down to the house two ducks swam in front of me and i thought oh man thats not a good sign
9252109 at that point i decided it wasnt a good idea to walk through that stuff water again there was no guessing what was in it
9252110 its amazing what they put you through it was just one roadblock after another
9252111 i never thought id be without a house for a year
9252112 now i have to pay for flood insurance which i didnt have to before and i have a mortgage that im going to be paying on for the rest of my life i was a year away from paying off my other house but ive got a place to live and nobody got hurt thank god
9252113 i dont know where id be without family and friends
9252114 ill be glad when i can just work my five hours here and go home
9252115 ive talked to the army corps and theyve said yes we can take it out but fema says no not until they do some kind of study were not asking for money to do it we could do it ourselves
9252116 people of this town shouldnt have to deal with this anymore
9252117 someday i would like to come back and give back to the fair what it has given to me
9252118 i still even to this day get excited about it
9252119 ive got three loves of my life the fair family and farming
9252120 it was really the first opportunity i had to get out and see what was on the other side of the fence row
9252121 i was just amazed at the atmosphere at the people the friendly people
9252122 it is very important the youth of this county have a place to come and exhibit their livestock projects
9252123 i announce a lot of names through the fair through all the shows through all the junior fair king stuff i never read their names in the daily docket
9252124 i read it in the sports page the academic page the scholarship pages thats the type of kid the junior fair tries to encourage
9252125 so many families come together three and four generations in the barns sitting together talking
9252126 it just makes you feel good that they will take the time to sit down and have a common interest its heart warming
9252127 that will be the second or third proudest day of my life to have one child carry on the tradition
9252128 paint your chest scarlet and wear a plush buckeye on your head to watch a game from your living room
9252129 but dont even think of dressing up like hermione granger for the release of the next harry potter movie that would just be ridiculous
9252130 thats the kind of thinking we would like to promote on campus
9252131 once we know the carbon footprint we can see where we can cut back
9252132 we really think our incoming freshman have a much clearer idea of what needs to be done
9252133 what you do affects people on the other side of the earth and what they do affects you
9252134 just seeing yourself as a united states citizen can be detrimental
9252135 i honestly dont think you guys are taking this seriously
9252136 i dont think improving racial diversity is on the board tables corporate tables on the agenda at the schools so i simply ask that this not just be another meeting if you want it to happen you must make it happen
9252137 i dont have those applicants its hard to attract a diverse professional staff i wish i knew why
9252138 its not all about economics but thats part of it
9252139 but why is it ive seen the same thing for 52 years if you want it to be 98 percent anglo saxon then at least say thats the way i want it but if you dont have the guts to make a change
9252140 i dont think enough leaders have taken the reins and said we need to do this for the children
9252141 they deserve the opportunity to look up and see a black officer they deserve the opportunity to look up and see a black teacher its not that there werent good white teachers but theres something about seeing yourself in your leaders
9252142 if were not helping him were just sitting here talking smack
9252143 its good to have passionate people because id feel worried if i didnt
9252144 there are things i think we would do different the next time but you have to remember we had never been through anything on that scale before
9252145 i think there was some confusion until everyone got on the same page
9252146 if there was anything that went wrong it was with the radios
9252147 but in the grand scheme of things the outcome was fantastic we turned into the talk of the state
9252148 my experience has been that people have a tendency to come together or want to help during a crisis like this
9252149 but this community was truly amazing you just do not see that kind of response
9252150 actually were still learning things id say every day we deal with some sort of flood issue
9252151 that was a different animal than what we had seen before
9252152 at that point we realized we were in for something different than we had ever seen
9252153 i didnt even see main street until the water was receding
9252154 but my job is to operate the center and make sure people are getting the things they need
9252155 having a public information officer on board sooner would have helped that
9252156 we did have some problems keeping track of where people were especially when we were doing all those boat rescues
9252157 there were times when it would have been helpful for us to be able to talk with some of the other agencies
9252158 some of them had been working two days or more and it was starting to take its toll having them here sooner would have given them a break
9252159 the commissioners and the ema did a great job in doing all the things they did
9252160 but there needs to be a way for cities to get to the resources they need more quickly
9252161 i suspect they were frustrated with us at times but we couldnt wait we needed to get things done quickly
9252162 it was good to learn we had many more strengths than weaknesses
9252163 but you can always learn from your experiences and get better at what you do
9252164 we had some situations where people were evacuated who had dogs or cats
9252165 we couldnt take them to the cube so it would be nice to have some relationship with the humane society so animals could be taken care of
9252166 it is something that we believe they salvation army or goodwill can handle better than we can
9252167 the idea is to get people familiar with what to expect in case something like this would ever happen again
9252168 what we learned from the august flood was that a flood of this magnitude can happen more than once in a hundred years
9252169 i feel the taxpayers will see the need this time to try to fix the problem and wont lose sight of what needs to be done to keep this community whole and productive
9252170 rbi is looking into a broad based policy issue with regard to the foreign venture capital investments in the country
9252171 i am really happy to play in a team like milan
9252172 for me this is a dream come true everything has happened really fast in a week everything here is incredible the people are very easy going and they have made me feel like im at home
9252173 in the past i have achieved some success to have become european champion with the under 17 national team and of course at the age of 18 to have arrived to a big club as arsenal in london i have learned a lot it has been a life school and manager arsene wenger has helped me
9252174 today i can say i have reached a superior level by coming to this club i want to give 100 per cent and improve every day this team wants to return to the champions league and i will do everything i can to help
9252175 we want to widen the service tax base and pay special attention to these sections which are neither registered with us nor pay service tax the ground work has already been done with regard to this and we expect to complete the process soon
9252176 they have a huge revenue potential but at present are escaping the tax net
9252177 most large developers have now woken up to the fact that affordable housing projects have the fastest absorption rates and are focusing on this
9252178 its an absolutely must win game we have to bounce back to victory before welcoming newcastle because our group is getting better and better as soon as we win
9252179 as a consequence we are going to play this game to win despite the difficulties we faced against this team in the first leg
9252180 matuidi has an important work rate and can run like a mad during 90 minutes and more like flamini good passer he scored a beautiful goal last saturday too very good defensively good tackler too what we need
9252181 arsenal are reportedly closing in on the signing of saint etiennes
9252182 from the corner gallas header was cleared off the line even as the pace of the game slowed the gunners showed no signs of relaxing their assault on the newcastle goal

9252189 as a friend of joleens i have been fortunate to see her work progress throughout the past few years i have been fortunate to have her shoot our young daughter and family on more than one occasion and each time she has been encouraging calm and fun the shoots have been very relaxed and enjoyable and the final product has been beautiful
9252190 she is shooting now we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9252191 she lacks the gravitas she lacks the knowledge she lacks the experience if she were a news anchor wed say she reeks of local

9252201 i thank god for my daughter who was so smart she said you have to leave and i tell you its a hurting thing to leave what you have but god has a purpose for it
9252202 we did this three years ago with katrina and its just unbelievable you know i have family going to houston some are going to atlanta and my mother is coming back to chicago
9252203 the sad part is theyre used to that kind of suffering
9252204 its another hurricane and they brace themselves but like it happens so often and they have to go through so much you know the hardship of their daily life and then this you know people lose their homes they lose their crops its really sad

9252211 adam and aime have had some very talented and skilled directors on their show
9252212 tina and i are very happy to be able to spend some time on this show to talk about our titles and shooting adult dvd review has always featured adults best directors and were very excited to be a part of it
9252213 ive never forgotten what its like to be on the business end of a camera and anyone whos seen what i shoot knows that adult can also mean heavy and hardcore
9252214 its great that a show with a wide audience like adult dvd review is taking note of my work

9252218 energy conservation isnt just visible its a public point of pride or shame
9252219 in reaching the decision the commission was trying to move xcel energy toward carbon reduction goals that gov bill ritter has outlined in his climate action plan
9252220 also they were adding renewable energy resources in a cost effective technically feasible manner ensuring an adequate supply of electricity in the future and being respectful of the cost that consumers have to bear
9252221 women could stop using body creams and perfumes although we do not have conclusive evidence that they do harm there are components about which there are question marks for example it could be certain combinations of chemicals

9252223 suspension from membership of the party is a serious matter which will stand on councillor hanifs record in relation to all future activity
9252224 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9252225 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9252226 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9252227 whats that human you are up and walking toward the bathroom perhaps
9252228 our helicopters were barely able to fly for most of the day yesterday as it continued raining heavily till 4 p m
9252229 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9252230 there is an unresolved problem in this country i personally consider this problem will only be solved through dialogue and negotiation
9252231 during this process all basque political prisoners must be freed
9252232 freerun is about risk and risk is all about calculating
9252233 you make a calculation with your body if you see a jump or a move that you feel you can do then you should do it even if you are scared if you are afraid and you dont make the move then you are letting fear beat you you have to overcome fear and be successful
9252234 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9252235 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9252236 everything is getting worse there are more kidnappings and more murders
9252237 at no time did it spanair indicate its intention to substitute the aircraft that suffered the accident
9252238 later it told the airport control centre that it was keeping it
9252239 so someone sitting in the united states you see the news and you cannot differentiate
9252240 what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9252241 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9252242 i want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9252243 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers which began at about 19 30 1830 gmt on saturday fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9252244 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9252245 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9252246 i feel comfortable in my own skin that the ship of state is on course and people are very nice to us wherever we go
9252247 its definitely easier for me to get work in the us
9252248 with my image im much better off working here i look african american so there is market for me in america
9252249 its important to know as an actor or a model where the most work is for you and unfortunately that wasnt the case for me in australia
9252250 here ill be called in for roles where they are specifically looking for a dark skinned girl and that just wouldnt happen for me in australia
9252251 there just werent that many roles that i could be called in for because i simply wasnt what they were looking for
9252252 i came over to do a six month course and then i started getting lucky with work
9252253 it is exciting to have so many choices in australia it would be very difficult for me to get the same opportunities
9252254 her physique is amazing i was really happy with how she turned out
9252255 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
9252256 finally the afp have decided to tell the world what weve been saying since we got involved in the matter
9252257 but i think it would be early days yet and we should wait until the clarke inquiry concludes before we go down that path
9252258 its difficult to know why it took so long it shouldnt have and i believe that it was just mainly the afp playing games with mohameds freedom
9252259 it was a very complicated issue and afp police commissioner mick keelty decided that he would deal with it in that fashion
9252260 im not an expert in that area so its a bit out of my league to try and give ranges or estimates of what it could be
9252261 because it means now that if he ever has the plans to come back those plans can be looked at a little more seriously
9252262 but its unlikely that hell come back in the immediate future but it may happen later
9252263 there was a touch of hollywood it was like a movie premiere
9252264 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9252265 they believe that climate change will cause serious problems in australia and elsewhere in the world and they understand there will be sizeable cost going along with it
9252266 the lower income houses and seniors very strongly support labors plan to redistribute the income to those households while the middle to high income households clearly support reducing the gst
9252267 the public clearly favours spending 20 per cent of the money on r amp d even though we told them that if they did that they would redistribute less money to the public
9252268 that shows the australians are very forward looking they see it as a long term problem and the r amp d efforts will help them get over the hump
9252269 i hope that the situation is not so serious as it may have looked
9252270 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9252271 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie
9252272 and then on the front nine my back nine a couple eagles really boosted the round for a while there there was certainly a chance of 59
9252273 our mission is to prevent anyone from claiming that dokdo is not korean territory
9252274 we are striving to offer scientific incontrovertible proof that dokdo is korean
9252275 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too that was the biggest win for me
9252276 i was playing great and he was playing great too that was the biggest win for me
9252277 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9252278 i think shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best its nice to feel like when youre playing your best
9252279 right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9252280 right now i am very happy thats the only word i can say now
9252281 i am really tired my ankle legs and back are sore and everything is hurting now
9252282 he was starting to play great in the third and fourth sets and i was tired my legs were almost cramping
9252283 in formula one you have to give someone half a year of time before you start to judge him
9252284 the half year is over and he bourdais is now in a situation where he has to prove his talents
9252285 i would not say i already have a clear opinion on him but i also have to say sebastian vettel started a couple of races before and he performed very well in the first half year
9252286 when i played wimbledon the first time i had never played four sets in my life never mind five
9252287 i did start to work hard after that but you have to respect your body as well and i was still doing a lot of growing
9252288 its been said that i was treated like a prince but that is not how it was
9252289 here i had difficult moments as well which i overcame with work and sacrifice now im very optimistic because returning to milan is like returning home
9252290 when i was at chelsea what i missed most was the organization the preparation and the atmosphere of this club lots of little things that are nevertheless important
9252291 its good that i pulled it out i was physically down and felt so heavy she was playing good but i gave her all the chances to play good but these are the kind of matches you sometimes need to get through
9252292 its going to be a big hunt tomorrow especially with those ryder cup guys doing so well
9252293 its still a very open tournament but its always nice to lead after three rounds
9252294 i have been working to develop a positive attitude and it has given me a whole new outlook on life
9252295 i just thought ive got to kill him or hes going to kill one of my kids and i couldnt live with that
9252296 he got very angry because i hadnt brought the bread in quick enough
9252297 ive been asked a thousand times why didnt you leave why did you keep going back
9252298 its not a simple thing when someones a control freak a psychopath he always found me anytime i got away and it made it far worse
9252299 he grabbed hold of the gun in my hand and he twisted it and he was trying to twist it out of my hand and it went off
9252300 i just thought ive got to kill him or hes going to kill one of my kids and i couldnt live with that
9252301 he got very angry because i hadnt brought the bread in quick enough
9252302 ive been asked a thousand times why didnt you leave why did you keep going back
9252303 its not a simple thing when someones a control freak a psychopath he always found me anytime i got away and it made it far worse
9252304 he grabbed hold of the gun in my hand and he twisted it and he was trying to twist it out of my hand and it went off
9252305 eamon and i have had a couple of weeks doing the whole davenport underwear campaign together and that has been enjoyable to do that with him
9252306 obviously we are really great friends and it has been a great experience
9252307 we went for a bit of a shopping spree today and it ended up being the first thing i tried on i love this dress it is very fun and suits my personality
9252308 it was one of the rare days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9252309 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that told me it was going to be like that
9252310 it was just one of those days where i made a 15 footer on the first hole and then another one on the second hole
9252311 i built on that momentum and just kept doing the same things keeping the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low today
9252312 four under is fine another round like that in the morning and ill be right in there
9252313 the par fives are reachable in two shots theres a short par four the rough is playable theres a bit of width off the tee and the greens roll good
9252314 there are plenty of train wrecks out there but this is the most enjoyable course weve played in a long time
9252315 he needs to get it 100 per cent right in big races rather than get run down and to his credit the ride wins the race
9252316 boats ferries buses and trains everything is booked out or cancelled we have no idea how to get off the island
9252317 it is lovely here but now we want to go
9252318 i guess i wont make it but at least i have a good excuse
9252319 once weve got the advice from dfat department of foreign affairs and trade and the airport is open then we will know that we can operate out
9252320 concentrations of military personnel and follow any instructions issued by local authorities
9252321 our embassy in bangkok is monitoring the situation closely and is in touch with local authorities
9252322 our post in bangkok is not aware of any safety concerns for australian travellers but continues to monitor the situation
9252323 i think its extra pressure with this no 1 position just something that you have to learn to deal with
9252324 everybody has good opportunity i dont think its going to help this tournament
9252325 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9252326 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9252327 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9252328 my boyfriend says hell dump me if i ever get a tattoo
9252329 he is going to get one of me but he wont let me get one
9252330 he doesnt like tattoos on women he thinks i look pure
9252331 so a few months later i got a cross to cover it
9252332 i dont know why they do it with their track record of relationships it doesnt make sense
9252333 why not test it out for a couple of days first
9252334 in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world and we have standards they may be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9252335 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team in my opinion and the rest of the leadership groups opinion you need to be committed 100 per cent to all facets of being an international cricketer
9252336 creating art is very therapeutic for me my work involves the healing and renewing aspects of nature as well as the sense of place that we all share i am especially fascinated with the reclaiming by nature of the materials that we choose to build with where i live in the northeastern united states there are many hulking rusting monuments to another age that are being taken back by a force that never rests
9252337 not many players get to choose when they want to leave test rugby and i think thats what makes it so special for me because i know that at test level its time to go
9252338 ive had many memorable moments in the springbok jersey and some very testing ones as well but id never exchange one moment of either the highs or lows
9252339 its been a privilege to play for my country and to play in some of the best teams the world has seen
9252340 i was asked why i would come back after the high of winning the world cup in france but for me every time i put on a bok jersey was a high and i got to do that eight more times this year
9252341 most importantly id like to spend time with my family its quite difficult going overseas for four weeks at a time
9252342 ive been doubling up seasons from the world cup and my body just needs a break
9252343 these special cocktails need to be shared with the world
9252344 we actually observed benefits with just doing a little bit of exercise
9252345 our mission is to prevent anyone from claiming that dokdo is not korean territory
9252346 we are striving to offer scientific incontrovertible proof that dokdo is korean
9252347 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9252348 its a deadlock so we keep on protesting we are determined
9252349 the proposals to send more u s forces to iraq would not produce a long term solution and would make our policy less not more sustainable
9252350 changing the dynamics surge and fight create breathing space and then accelerate the transition
9252351 we believe that we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9252352 the market is just very fragile theres not a lot of support going into the labour day weekend
9252353 the dell news has compounded the downside move when you have a non financial company missing its earnings thats disconcerting to the market
9252354 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie
9252355 and then on the front nine my back nine a couple eagles really boosted the round for a while there there was certainly a chance of 59
9252356 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by press the media players everybody
9252357 its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen and read and to get all the b s all week its seriously seriously mentally draining
9252358 its going to be a big hunt tomorrow especially with those ryder cup guys doing so well
9252359 its still a very open tournament but its always nice to lead after three rounds
9252360 our data together with previous reports shows pre cancerous lesions are also associated with obesity
9252361 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9252362 in formula one you have to give someone half a year of time before you start to judge him
9252363 the half year is over and he bourdais is now in a situation where he has to prove his talents
9252364 i would not say i already have a clear opinion on him but i also have to say sebastian vettel started a couple of races before and he performed very well in the first half year
9252365 at little after nine this morning weve already done as much trading as we did yesterday were well on our way to do a lot of trade
9252366 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9252367 a simple requirement in the constitution to have a presidential running mate would have saved zambia and its donor partners a staggering 70m dollars that is the estimated administrative cost of the upcoming bye elections
9252368 my god did i kill somebody am i a terrorist
9252369 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days
9252370 theyre so much faster than michigan was said quarterback armanti edwards who had his helmet and nearly his head knocked off three times
9252371 holy smoke the way the game started 31 0 i looked up at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits appalachian coach jerry moore said
9252372 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9252373 it was a dream come true and my life turned 180 degrees in one night
9252374 i think sometimes when things arent working at this level teams really can make you pay
9252375 but at the same time when it turns around and it clicks it can be pretty good
9252376 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9252377 the way we view him and how we value him hasnt changed
9252378 the biggest thing for a player is to learn what their abilities are and what are their limits and to make the adjustments with the lines
9252379 for all his struggles hes had this year hes actually a better pitcher than he was last year
9252380 i want to thank god i want to thank my coach and i definitely want to thank our university of texas fans
9252381 im going to keep representing the university of texas till i die
9252382 i was really touched by how much he reached out to his fans
9252383 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9252384 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9252385 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9252386 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9252387 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9252388 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9252389 unless you study the game you dont understand the implications of a win like that
9252390 as i tried to say way back and no one would believe me if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football its the only thing i know how to do
9252391 a continuing pattern of how fuelberg and burnett lined their own pockets by fleecing the pedernales membership
9252392 there has been no criminal immunity provided to anybody in pec private parties cannot agree that the state will not bring charges
9252393 i dont want to prejudge any facts until we get into it but i can tell you we will be very aggressive
9252394 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9252395 you just have to be smart about your body and how it feels
9252396 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9252397 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9252398 a community committed to sharing values of diversity and inclusion
9252399 factors such as family size health care costs sibling educational expenses and other non discretionary expenses that place a drain on family finances are considered carefully and there is no income cut off for need based scholarship eligibility
9252400 i can tell you its going to take more than eating tamales and speaking some spanish
9252401 mi familia vota has been working in partnership with the national association of latino elected and appointed officials univisi n and entrevisi n since 2007 to encourage people to become citizens and last year 1 029 000 of them did
9252402 were following up to make sure they register and vote
9252403 the obama campaign and the dnc will spend a total of 20 million at least five times more than the dnc and the presidential campaigns have ever spent on latinos in any previous campaign
9252404 we will target latinos in 20 states because latinos are not just in a few key states they are throughout the country
9252405 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9252406 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9252407 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9252408 it depends on why you want to chop it down
9252409 if you think youre going to save a lot of water id think twice
9252410 some people say youll get the springs flowing again but that would not pass the scientific sniff test
9252411 it doesnt always happen and i can show you ranches where clearing cedar didnt change anything
9252412 theres this notion that trees are finding these big oceans of water that other plants can get to and thats just wrong
9252413 intuitively it makes sense but cedars are found in shallow soils with rock beneath them it really isnt a deep rooted species
9252414 we just know very little about the hydrology of the hill country
9252415 theres a lot of contradictory information out there people try to extrapolate data from other locations but the hill country is totally different
9252416 its a place where policy has gotten ahead of the science
9252417 i know i am opening a can of huge worms but this seems like a very cool addition to me
9252418 this could just be one of the most exciting cars to hit the road since well since the original mini cooper handbrake turned onto the scene sadly though the reality is anything but instead of being the best sporting mini ever created it is the least appealing ive driven
9252419 there are a few small problems you could overlook the interior is barely distinguishable from that of the standard cooper s the new badges look cheap and in the quest for more visual
9252420 natural in the hands of the enthusiast as where as the new electric setup feels more artificial and isolated by comparison even with the sport button turned on
9252421 i might text him later and well go get some in n out burger no wait edwards doesnt eat that stuff probably i dont know maybe salads
9252422 its going to make the race interesting going to make it good for the fans and im a fan and im going to enjoy watching what they do between each other
9252423 doesnt matter were here to race and the racings been pretty good
9252424 all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him
9252425 what really matters is we race well on the race track i say well be fine
9252426 means you cant do anything like you did last week again nascar did what they thought was right
9252427 not worried about being on probation i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me it will be good practice
9252428 people always say that all im doing out there is running into people im telling you im not out there to try to move anybody
9252429 we like it laugh at it pick and choose our favorites
9252430 but the fans totally eat it up and thats why we need more of it
9252431 were having fun with it every chance i get i say something to him
9252432 id just as soon not go through it again to be honest with you
9252433 its a job where you are always second to a dog
9252434 i didnt look forward to what i call the spanish inquisition of shopping for insurance
9252435 but its better than some of the horrendous rate increases ive seen
9252436 access to affordable health insurance is the no 1 no 2 and no 3 issue for small businesses
9252437 to keep better employees we started paying full insurance premiums
9252438 the good thing about all these companies being publicly traded is that we can look at their financial reports
9252439 they know they need to provide benefits or theyre not going to have the work force so theyre doing everything they can
9252440 make sure the benefits match what your employees need or want
9252441 those investments include approximately 115 million in real property improvements and 130 million in new personal property
9252442 if the vendor services contract with ups is consummated dhl will likely lose most of the benefit of those investments dhl would not be pursuing this course absent a clear necessity or without great deliberation
9252443 the state offered an approximately 400 million incentive package for the dhl project
9252444 dhl may have elected to utilize only certain incentives from that package
9252445 i think that weve made every opportunity to sit down and listen to every request that theyve had
9252446 we have not been afforded the same courtesies that the state of ohio has offered them
9252447 incentives are controversial enough welching on a deal even though legally they may be able to do it doesnt help
9252448 if sally works for joes produce stand and gets cancer thats going to jeopardize joes ability to sell produce
9252449 the downside is that rates are higher in many cases
9252450 people need to ask questions about exactly how much coverage theyre getting
9252451 we couldnt guarantee that level of coverage or that companies are sound financially a company could not pay a dime of claims and theres nothing we could do for consumers
9252452 theyre pretty easy to set up and for some its the only affordable option
9252453 a simple requirement in the constitution to have a presidential running mate would have saved zambia and its donor partners a staggering 70m dollars that is the estimated administrative cost of the upcoming bye elections
9252454 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
9252455 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
9252456 we decided to go ahead with this after the enormous success of our first step into asia tokyo which was great in terms of recognition and sales
9252457 so we wanted to move into china and where else could you start but hong kong we found an incredible number of restaurants with very good quality
9252458 we made a pre selection of about 1 200 restaurants of maybe more than 15 000 and we dined in more than 800
9252459 we want to help people find out where you can get a really good meal and the good hotels its interesting that some of the big names are coming here joel robuchon was on my air france flight
9252460 hong kong is a melting pot for all cultures and many different types of chinese cuisine are available
9252461 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9252462 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9252463 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9252464 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9252465 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9252466 its something they have across the board at every position
9252467 you gotta make as much money as you can because when we shut down and were gonna shut down thats it for a long while
9252468 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9252469 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess
9252470 our boss was into playing his trumpet down here more than he was into running a business so that all kinda went to hell and now im working here
9252471 ive never been through one and im not sure what to believe you see the national weather people and theyre telling you its gonna be really bad
9252472 i dont leave for nothing i didnt even leave for katrina
9252473 i mean look at the local weather guys they know what theyre doing not those weather channel people the local people say its gonna move north and thats enough for me
9252474 lot of folks around here are gonna make do with what they have and you wont hear a terrible amount of complaining
9252475 you cant just come in here and expect to hear people fussing about how they dont have nothing people just be used to not having much and so you dont even think too hard about it until someone starts asking you questions
9252476 now what do you think that would look like me and my little car sitting there in traffic with two big old rottweilers
9252477 guess im just gonna wait i just dont know its all stressful
9252478 its hard to explain to someone whos not from here why anyone would choose to stay
9252479 as long as i have power im good probably wont have power for long but this place is pretty tough
9252480 when you stand out there by that river and look at that levee
9252481 you are just so blessed to live here i am in love and so i make my choice
9252482 thats not the way we planned it we fully expected to win
9252483 but they did theirs better than we did ours and they win the game
9252484 hes been very good the second one wasnt a great snap or hold but he was accountable and said he should have made it and hes right
9252485 i wish we didnt put all that on him and had scored touchdowns but we made too many mistakes
9252486 we faced some adversity on first drive and hit a wall basically
9252487 i dont know why we werent able to bounce back but we never got it going
9252488 sometimes its like that little dutch boy trying to plug up the dike
9252489 i thought we played well in spurts but wed give up a big play and couldnt get off the field thats my fault not the kids fault
9252490 but youve got to wrap the ball up no excuses
9252491 we decided to go ahead with this after the enormous success of our first step into asia tokyo which was great in terms of recognition and sales
9252492 so we wanted to move into china and where else could you start but hong kong we found an incredible number of restaurants with very good quality
9252493 we made a pre selection of about 1 200 restaurants of maybe more than 15 000 and we dined in more than 800
9252494 we want to help people find out where you can get a really good meal and the good hotels its interesting that some of the big names are coming here joel robuchon was on my air france flight
9252495 hong kong is a melting pot for all cultures and many different types of chinese cuisine are available
9252496 ill be real honest with you we dont have a lot of play calls inside the 20
9252497 we stubbed our foot a lot it doesnt surprise me we made mistakes
9252498 we felt in order to take our growing practice to the next level our site needed to be revamped
9252499 as a practice that understands the full spectrum of womens unique health care needs we also understand that todays patient is relying more on the web as a source of information so our redesigned site provides new and existing patients a resource that will help them in preparing for their visit
9252500 a simple requirement in the constitution to have a presidential running mate would have saved zambia and its donor partners a staggering 70m dollars that is the estimated administrative cost of the upcoming bye elections
9252501 it took a couple plays to get the jitters out but i had fun
9252502 i wasnt trying to hurt him just trying to put everything into my hit that i could
9252503 byus a tough team and i also want my team to play tough like that
9252504 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9252505 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well
9252506 it came to a point where i couldnt mess around any more
9252507 my inner soul is blooming and my body becomes an eggshell
9252508 when you show kids that they are worth something they are less likely to get into trouble
9252509 i find it truly bizarre that the labour party is prepared to accept owen glenns money but wasnt willing to accept his word earlier in the week
9252510 i visited him and asked him to consider a donation his money is as good as anyones
9252511 all the entries and debits are perfectly clear there is no ambiguity
9252512 oh i dont know about that rubbish i couldnt discuss that
9252513 the press of new zealand has combined in a tidal wave of prejudice trying to besmirch him
9252514 its like a whole lot of sharks in the bloody sea around some sort of thing they want to eat
9252515 mr glenn has not made a fresh donation to the labour party
9252516 bizarre that the labour party have enough confidence to try and take more money off owen glenn but not enough confidence to believe him when it comes to his version of winston peters donations scandal
9252517 the prime minister now needs to tell new zealanders on how many occasions she raised the contradictary version of events with mr peters and mr glenn and furthermore why she didnt instruct mr peters to directly contact mr glenn when he clearly refuted his version of events in february
9252518 but i understand youve got to choose sides either north or south
9252519 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious
9252520 as long as im there i dont care whos there playing against me
9252521 i guarantee you because that citys going to go crazy i think to the players it would be awesome to the fans i dont know for me and lou
9252522 i actually root for the white sox when we dont play them
9252523 i really do i root for all the chicago teams i hope our fans do too
9252524 we went out from the beginning trying not to lose instead of playing to win
9252525 the moral of the story on this game is we did win the game we didnt play well and we know it i was excited with the character we showed nobody gave up the ship and we carried on
9252526 i dont think its our starters stuff or anything like that its been tough to have to come back so many times still you have 81 2 innings to come back and rally and we didnt get the job done
9252527 m s profunda y m s larga de lo que piensa la gente
9252528 sinceramente subraya los pr ximos doce meses ser n los doce meses m s dif ciles que el partido laborista ha vivido en una generaci n
9252529 that is cheap abundant and clean compared to fossil fuel
9252530 we obviously didnt finish the season the way we wanted to last year this is another opportunity another year to erase those negative thoughts
9252531 he said it the first day its going to be a little bit of a circus with a lot going on
9252532 ive been pleasantly surprised with how well it has gone for the most part everybody knows what we have going the perception of who we are were eager to get out on the field
9252533 peoples perceptions they roll with that stuff over and over and you just have to try and keep a level head about it all
9252534 but for us we dont add to it we dont all talk about whatever happened in adam jones past or critique his lifestyle or terrell owens and what hes wearing even though its exotic and crazy sometimes
9252535 we play a game and we enjoy it we just talk about that sometimes it helps
9252536 this is a serious situation the nzru have been patient i hope they can exercise just a little more
9252537 i hope this doesnt escalate into something more serious i can understand the frustration but there are mitigating circumstances
9252538 whats more they say all the players who play in the final will be made available for the june tests if they are not injured
9252539 what have i done wrong weve got nothing to hide other than maybe some shoddy administration
9252540 we could almost run our entire school on that that sounds very wrong that almost sounds like a semi professional team not a high school
9252541 the first couple of years we took money out of our own pockets to get it up and going i did all the books for nothing i even paid for some of the kids to get boots then we applied for pokie funds
9252542 my wife owns the pubs i speak on her behalf on these issues because shes quite a shy person im probably better at handling those kind of things what we found was you need to have a relationship with some of these people
9252543 they did know we wanted the money to go locally we had to plead our case of course
9252544 were trying to tidy that area up they dia believe if its for rugby it should go to the academy if its for mentoring it should go directly to tallys account
9252545 we do agree we should watch our backsides a bit more sometimes ill pay from the wrong account but i believe everything we applied for has been put to those activities
9252546 we have nothing to hide at all were happy to provide paperwork
9252547 some of our kids struggle to put food on the table i am not saying we feed them but we do a lot for them
9252548 from the schools point of view its been a fantastic thing theyve done kids who would otherwise be hanging around the streets are off the streets and we now have eight boys teams and one girls team which are very successful
9252549 we said tell you what well give bob some to take with him and how bout he drops it off on the way
9252550 zach braff comes in and says it smells like ass i say no it smells like cheese we eat cheese from everywhere france italy spain but the windsor blue is pretty much my favourite we used to buy it all the time and our local store said they couldnt get it any more so we emailed new zealand
9252551 it depends if they have to be in a bikini next week the cheese intake can change
9252552 we were like no we cant wait this is direct from new zealand this is special
9252553 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252554 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252555 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252556 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252557 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252558 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252559 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252560 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252561 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252562 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
9252563 obviously we need to make sure that the way in which we conduct our business is in keeping with what we would expect our members to expect
9252564 ive spoken to garth and he told me that he was involved in some filming over six years ago while he was single living in auckland
9252565 i have also spoken to nzhc board members who were previously unaware of the situation and they have accepted his resignation
9252566 i have nothing to say about this you have ruined my life
9252567 they were trying to personalise things talking about themselves and trying to get the attacker to talk about himself
9252568 they just processed things in their minds and they felt and i believe them that this was an isolated act
9252569 he came along and helped out comforted them they took their van back to his place where they stayed the night in the van
9252570 i think its just given the whole east coast a bit of a nasty reputation that it doesnt really need especially for tourism
9252571 the biggest benefit is to those who have had their houses retrofitted
9252572 the nicest thing about it is that it is a project that had hugely improved the quality of life in our community
9252573 its extremely difficult for maori community groups to establish relationships with the private sector
9252574 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252575 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252576 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252577 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252578 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252579 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252580 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252581 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252582 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252583 no parental control we were the envy of all other teenagers we actually had a ball
9252584 i am not sure its a state i will ever get used to
9252585 we went back to my flat and he said oh we need to drink some bubbles or something i remember opening a bottle of chardon and giving him a glass and he was absolutely horrified
9252586 you have had the most amazing life you eat caviar for breakfast you have had thousands of girlfriends
9252587 do you think gods a woman and its payback time
9252588 i have had some very good friends people whom im grateful came into my life
9252589 competition is always good for consumers and therefore the industry customers will ultimately decide where the best deals are and were confident that we have great value
9252590 theyre suffering from the arrogance of being in power too long at the moment theyre a coalition corpse theyre gone and anybody who is associated too closely with them is likely to be gone as well
9252591 clearly were not going to be the party that wins the most votes but we are hoping to be the players after the election and we are doing all that we can to take the seven maori seats and put ourselves in a position where we will not be the last cab off the rank but be the first limousine
9252592 southlands stories define who we are as a province and a people
9252593 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252594 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252595 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9252596 i can tell you that directing was maybe the happiest moment of my professional life just arriving on set i had a smile and it hasnt vanished until now
9252597 we never in real life tell stories in a linear way
9252598 i think that cinema is a very young medium and its beginning to find its own language and among these languages is the deconstruction of time
9252599 i have been obsessed with the weight of death over the living ones
9252600 my identity is constructed by the people that i love by the people that surround me every time one dies part of my identity is broken and lost i am obsessed at how that loss of someone that i love affects my own identity
9252601 im fascinated by how this industry survives how it struggles
9252602 i dont have to do it every time but its something that i really enjoy when i feel i meet people where were like minded and we walk the same road and tell the same story
9252603 especially i think now in her age more than when she was working in her 30s theres a strength with this leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch
9252604 a first in first served water allocation system is not appropriate
9252605 in southland the growing number of dairy conversions is putting pressure on councils ability to source domestic water supply now and into the future
9252606 theres some aquifers that are currently fully allocated allowing for no allocation to future water needs in communities such as lumsden
9252607 councillor jim copland made the comment that by the time it the policy comes along maybe the horse has bolted
9252608 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252609 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252610 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9252611 theyre suffering from the arrogance of being in power too long at the moment theyre a coalition corpse theyre gone and anybody who is associated too closely with them is likely to be gone as well
9252612 clearly were not going to be the party that wins the most votes but we are hoping to be the players after the election and we are doing all that we can to take the seven maori seats and put ourselves in a position where we will not be the last cab off the rank but be the first limousine
9252613 the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
9252614 evan and his staff have operated the track on behalf of the trust for the last five years and have had the creativity to upgrade the facilities at both aka and port craig lodges
9252615 the trust would like to express their appreciation to evan and his staff for their achievement in making the track an awesome experience and a must do adventure
9252616 the trustees are a lovely bunch of people doing a wonderful thing in a lovely part of the country however it was time for me to move on and explore new avenues
9252617 i wish trish and ali all the best for the new challenge ahead
9252618 we decided to try another challenge and when the opportunity to manage the track surfaced we jumped at the chance to get the bit between our teeth and give it a go
9252619 we will endeavour to run the track for the benefit of the local businesses and community
9252620 no parental control we were the envy of all other teenagers we actually had a ball
9252621 i am not sure its a state i will ever get used to
9252622 we went back to my flat and he said oh we need to drink some bubbles or something i remember opening a bottle of chardon and giving him a glass and he was absolutely horrified
9252623 you have had the most amazing life you eat caviar for breakfast you have had thousands of girlfriends
9252624 do you think gods a woman and its payback time
9252625 i have had some very good friends people whom im grateful came into my life
9252626 oh i dont know about that rubbish i couldnt discuss that
9252627 the press of new zealand has combined in a tidal wave of prejudice trying to besmirch him
9252628 its like a whole lot of sharks in the bloody sea around some sort of thing they want to eat
9252629 mr glenn has not made a fresh donation to the labour party
9252630 bizarre that the labour party have enough confidence to try and take more money off owen glenn but not enough confidence to believe him when it comes to his version of winston peters donations scandal
9252631 the prime minister now needs to tell new zealanders on how many occasions she raised the contradictary version of events with mr peters and mr glenn and furthermore why she didnt instruct mr peters to directly contact mr glenn when he clearly refuted his version of events in february
9252632 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9252633 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9252634 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9252635 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9252636 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9252637 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9252638 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9252639 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9252640 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9252641 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9252642 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9252643 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9252644 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9252645 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9252646 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9252647 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9252648 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9252649 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9252650 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9252651 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9252652 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9252653 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9252654 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9252655 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9252656 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9252657 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere ive always felt like i give whatever team im on a good chance to win but theres way more to it than one guy
9252658 the bottom line was that i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win it would be difficult as it would be anywhere but i felt like this would be a good fit for me
9252659 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9252660 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9252661 i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career
9252662 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9252663 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9252664 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9252665 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9252666 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9252667 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9252668 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9252669 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9252670 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9252671 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9252672 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9252673 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9252674 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9252675 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9252676 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver brad smith can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9252677 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9252678 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective
9252679 let me assure you that dr treadway and i have communicated about the presidency here at ohlone
9252680 today we are the michael phelps of education and sustainability
9252681 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9252682 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9252683 you feel for anyone who goes down especially when it looks like a leg injury
9252684 first you think oh is it a knee then is it an ankle from what i gather other than getting medical people into it its a foot thing x rays are negative but absolutely your heart jumps
9252685 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9252686 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9252687 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9252688 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out
9252689 we came in with the game plan that we were going to load up and run the ball so i was pretty prepared for it
9252690 i just wanted to let people know what i can do and help my teammates out
9252691 we wanted to get darel scott some confidence and once he got it he was gone
9252692 normally he would break some of those runs i dont think he quite had his third gear today
9252693 we probably ran the ball better than i thought we would run the ball but we probably didnt throw it as well as we have been throwing it
9252694 i thought he played pretty good in the first half
9252695 i know he can play better than he did in the second half
9252696 this is not like a moral victory i dont believe in moral victories
9252697 we had opportunities and we let them get away were greatly disappointed
9252698 we play a home game we make more money than playing this game down here when we scheduled this game i thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid acc school
9252699 obviously that last throw you cant be happy with i feel like i just misread it
9252700 you guys cant wait to get out there huh i cant wait myself
9252701 what is michigan football where is this program at weve got a bunch of guys in winged helmets who are going to go down that tunnel and play their tails off and will play with pride passion and intensity on every snap thats what michigan football is
9252702 because im new what do we call a double edge pressure
9252703 i dont want them blowing up because of all the free time they have
9252704 with all the freshmen we have we need to be in the stadium on thursday
9252705 two or three years from now we probably wont need to do that
9252706 i was supposed to be at a team meal at 10 30 and i got there at 10 31
9252707 bo schembechler never had wives and kids around like this
9252708 but i love the pace of this practice and bo wouldve too
9252709 were going to sing the victors and were going to wear winged helmets were not going to change the tradition or the culture here
9252710 but tradition isnt going to get us a first down you have to earn that tradition isnt going to get you a degree you have to earn that and i hope every one of you does just that i dont think people outside the program really understand whats going on here
9252711 when you make a big play celebrate with a teammates because chances are a teammate helped you make the play
9252712 im not bsing you guys we have a lot of unknowns
9252713 i aint been in a game with yall but i cant wait to find out who you are
9252714 we just didnt feel it reached that level so we choose not to file charges
9252715 the only way he doesnt receive cases is if hes no longer a judge
9252716 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9252717 this is the real deal this is not a test
9252718 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9252719 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9252720 there are reports of evacuees from louisiana going into east texas looking for shelters and some communities have received up to 200 residents from louisiana
9252721 we are making accommodations to take care of these people we will move whatever resources we need to
9252722 the interests of justice are too great to ignore the prospect that the evidence may contain the dna of one of these four named individuals
9252723 they had observed significant price increases and heard others interpretation of such increases
9252724 low income individuals who took out risky subprime mortgages with interest rates that would soon be adjusted upward were often unaware of the known risks inherent in such mortgages they had no clue that there was a real risk that in the event of a crisis they would not be able to refinance their mortgages
9252725 for a little town to have a parade that big was amazing
9252726 i thought there would be a few people but the parade was amazing and this tops it all
9252727 i look forward to working collaboratively with tyc youth and their families along with lawmakers tyc employees juvenile justice system partners community agencies and advocacy groups to respond to the challenges and opportunities facing tyc
9252728 whats really striking is the absolute level of poor fitness across the board in general
9252729 were moving resources into areas where theyll be needed so well be ready for whatever mother nature throws at us
9252730 our job is to control gustav not let gustav control us
9252731 the better you plan the better off you are generally the more drills you can do the better off you are when you have to implement
9252732 every capability the state of texas has is now activated
9252733 because our assessment of the market yield on the debentures issued by dnz foundation and dnz income of 13 exceeds the interest rate paid on the respective debentures the fair market value of the debentures will be less than the nominal value of principal outstanding
9252734 you cant go round raising money saying there is no way out it the money managers secondary market used to trade really well but since times have got harder there have been less buyers coming in
9252735 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252736 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252737 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252738 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252739 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252740 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252741 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252742 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252743 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252744 theres no point panicking about this as we have really just got to understand what it means
9252745 if we dont get the answers to the questions we have then we will look at appealing the decision
9252746 its a bit of a joke i think we did not even get considered at all
9252747 if there is an effect on land values it will be due to adverse effects on amenity it is the latter i have to consider
9252748 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9252749 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9252750 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9252751 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9252752 im not going to chance it not with my grandchild
9252753 something needs to be done to stop her because i honestly dont think shes going to stop doing this until she sees blood
9252754 what she is doing is manipulative and its evil its only a matter of time before someone ends up dead
9252755 we felt sorry for her she was the new girl so we took her into our group of friends
9252756 we had no idea of what she had done in auckland we had no idea of what she was capable of
9252757 i would get text messages from him and then she would come up to me and talk to me about her brother and ask how we were getting on and stuff like that
9252758 the subject of suicide came up very early on in the piece but i just ignored it i didnt really think anything of it i thought it was a bit of a silly game
9252759 i got a text saying she was dead and that it was all my fault and that i should kill myself too
9252760 she then called my friend and told her that i was dead and that she shouldnt go to school the next day so when i got to school she wouldnt be there
9252761 i thought my friend was dead i didnt know what to do
9252762 this girl is evil and she needs to be stopped before she finally succeeds in killing someone
9252763 she needs help and the public need to be protected from her what she did to our daughter was just so evil
9252764 i thank my lucky stars every day that our girl was smart enough to realise that suicide is never an option
9252765 i dont know why youve come all the way down here
9252766 i know that im not the only one targeted there are others out there
9252767 shes going to keep doing this until she gets the result she wants
9252768 someone has to do something to stop her before she kills someone
9252769 so were going to hold off starting for a while
9252770 were pretty envious that new zealand is surrounded by the ocean
9252771 oh i dont know about that rubbish i couldnt discuss that
9252772 the press of new zealand has combined in a tidal wave of prejudice trying to besmirch him
9252773 its like a whole lot of sharks in the bloody sea around some sort of thing they want to eat
9252774 mr glenn has not made a fresh donation to the labour party
9252775 bizarre that the labour party have enough confidence to try and take more money off owen glenn but not enough confidence to believe him when it comes to his version of winston peters donations scandal
9252776 the prime minister now needs to tell new zealanders on how many occasions she raised the contradictary version of events with mr peters and mr glenn and furthermore why she didnt instruct mr peters to directly contact mr glenn when he clearly refuted his version of events in february
9252777 we see a lot of drink type incidents because queenstowns a party town but frequently we cant find out what theyve consumed because people have mixed shots with other drinks
9252778 it was sometimes like people were on acid or something it changed their personality really quickly and then others drank it and were fine
9252779 the problem occurs when people get on the absinthe and do heaps and heaps of shots
9252780 we have no thoughts of banning it here weve had no problems with it
9252781 we as parents had to watch him die twice in the ambulance and once at southland hospital before he was put on life support
9252782 its like that with chemo you have your good days and bad
9252783 i thought f because you think its never going to happen to you
9252784 its such a scary scary time but the nurses and everyone in the oncology department at kew southland hospital are amazing
9252785 i get really down sometimes but youve got to let it happen and know its okay because tomorrows another day
9252786 but only if fellow family south trust member murray smith lives up to his ace deerstalking reputation to deliver the vital ingredient
9252787 we certainly wont be doing anything different during the week than we usually do
9252788 what have i done wrong weve got nothing to hide other than maybe some shoddy administration
9252789 we could almost run our entire school on that that sounds very wrong that almost sounds like a semi professional team not a high school
9252790 the first couple of years we took money out of our own pockets to get it up and going i did all the books for nothing i even paid for some of the kids to get boots then we applied for pokie funds
9252791 my wife owns the pubs i speak on her behalf on these issues because shes quite a shy person im probably better at handling those kind of things what we found was you need to have a relationship with some of these people
9252792 they did know we wanted the money to go locally we had to plead our case of course
9252793 were trying to tidy that area up they dia believe if its for rugby it should go to the academy if its for mentoring it should go directly to tallys account
9252794 we do agree we should watch our backsides a bit more sometimes ill pay from the wrong account but i believe everything we applied for has been put to those activities
9252795 we have nothing to hide at all were happy to provide paperwork
9252796 some of our kids struggle to put food on the table i am not saying we feed them but we do a lot for them
9252797 from the schools point of view its been a fantastic thing theyve done kids who would otherwise be hanging around the streets are off the streets and we now have eight boys teams and one girls team which are very successful
9252798 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9252799 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9252800 im not going to chance it not with my grandchild
9252801 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252802 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252803 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9252804 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252805 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252806 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9252807 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252808 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252809 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252810 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252811 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252812 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252813 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252814 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252815 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252816 but their efforts should be applauded they are obviously making a real effort to fix the problem
9252817 all i need to know is that they are doing something to find a solution
9252818 it is really encouraging to see them go out on their own
9252819 i am sure once the new material they have put in is fixed up it will be beneficial down the line
9252820 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9252821 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9252822 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9252823 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9252824 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9252825 you guys cant wait to get out there huh i cant wait myself
9252826 what is michigan football where is this program at weve got a bunch of guys in winged helmets who are going to go down that tunnel and play their tails off and will play with pride passion and intensity on every snap thats what michigan football is
9252827 because im new what do we call a double edge pressure
9252828 i dont want them blowing up because of all the free time they have
9252829 with all the freshmen we have we need to be in the stadium on thursday
9252830 two or three years from now we probably wont need to do that
9252831 i was supposed to be at a team meal at 10 30 and i got there at 10 31
9252832 bo schembechler never had wives and kids around like this
9252833 but i love the pace of this practice and bo wouldve too
9252834 weve got two recruits coming in for official visits this weekend
9252835 were going to sing the victors and were going to wear winged helmets were not going to change the tradition or the culture here
9252836 but tradition isnt going to get us a first down you have to earn that tradition isnt going to get you a degree you have to earn that and i hope every one of you does just that i dont think people outside the program really understand whats going on here
9252837 the day before we opened at wisconsin bo said lets take a walk
9252838 he said if i make you my quarterback can you handle 85 000 fans wanting your head on a platter
9252839 i havent told him yet but hes bright enough to know because he goes out there with the no 1 offense and takes a lot of snaps
9252840 the pepperoni roll is not sitting well in my stomach
9252841 when you choose a college its not a four year decision
9252842 when you make a big play celebrate with a teammates because chances are a teammate helped you make the play
9252843 were going to take the field like we own it
9252844 im not bsing you guys we have a lot of unknowns
9252845 i aint been in a game with yall but i cant wait to find out who you are
9252846 every other team on our schedule is a worthy talented opponent so we know every week is a fight for our lives but i think it helps our schedule
9252847 the more they learn about concussions theyll definitely be cautious with it safe and cautious
9252848 it will be an international event with some different ideas to make it attractive to international teams
9252849 the competitors told us they wanted us to run a rally
9252850 it will also be a round of the new zealand championship
9252851 the structure for the rally is still up in the air
9252852 were working to come up with something that will be enticing to the internationals
9252853 manufacturers like peugeot and renault already have super 2000 cars that could be the basis for a rally car
9252854 the world rally championship is quite healthy at the moment with four manufacturers but there could be more
9252855 the level of interest from teams has reached its bottom and is on the way up again
9252856 there will be a rally in indonesia and were going into eastern europe poland bulgaria and russia
9252857 but we would prefer to have the classic rallies monte carlo finland greece and great britain run every year
9252858 its probably the drivers favourite because the roads are smooth fast and flowing without any big rocks
9252859 yesterday p g swede per gunnar andersson was fifth on two stages and thats our best result so far
9252860 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252861 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252862 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9252863 no one knows whether sarah palin could be a competent president which shows how highly political and potentially reckless this choice is
9252864 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9252865 its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda
9252866 republicans rightfully have criticised the democratic nominee senator barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison
9252867 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency
9252868 senator mccain has not only succeeded in unifying or party but also in generating great enthusiasm
9252869 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9252870 for nearly eight years now american public policy has been shaped in whole or in part by a president of the united states who has methodically unrelentingly sometimes aggressively and sometimes deceitfully attempted to replace americas system of decentralized shared power with his own vision of a society governed by the few the powerful and the increasingly unaccountable
9252871 a new mix of philosophies brashly interventionist corporate monarchical theologically oriented has displaced true american conservatism on the political stage
9252872 as the second bush presidency wore on conservatives became increasingly disenchanted mostly because the president had appealed to them by talking like a conservative while governing like a big spending liberal
9252873 although as bush worked his way through his first term and into his second there was more compassion than conservative in the term
9252874 the democrats sudden rediscovery of that old time franklin roosevelt religion
9252875 safe streets successful marriages cultural solidarity and vibrant religious and civic institutions make working class americans more likely to be wealthy healthy and upwardly mobile
9252876 for america to continue to be well america a nation of limited government and strong cultural solidarity in which the goods of our national life are distributed as widely and equitably as possible without sacrificing ownership and self reliance in the process
9252877 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the georgian special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
9252878 raises the suspicion that someone in the united states deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation
9252879 the theft loss was reported immediately to officials at the airport and i got a new one the following year
9252880 there were obviously russians on board the flight i dont know who it was but it seems like he made a good profit from it
9252881 until we can contact mr white i cant give additional comment
9252882 helped me make sense about how i got seduced by the city and how i got seduced by my husband and i guess seduced by the idea of a house
9252883 new orleans was always our far more storied older sister to the south
9252884 a genuinely cosmopolitan city and one where everything from world class restaurants to transvestite hookers was available
9252885 falling hard for a man i knew i shouldnt have
9252886 like riding around in a big car with the air conditioning blowing and the radio blaring and all the windows rolled down it felt like home because it was
9252887 now here i am not committing to jack and all of a sudden im going to commit and im going to get the whole shebang the husband the house which overextended us without a hurricane
9252888 i cant say that i was smart enough to say that i planned it this way but writing the book sort of helped me make sense of my own trajectory when i have to describe the book at readings and such i say part of it is a coming of age story except its middle age so here i am i mean it took me so long to decide that i was going to straighten up and settle down and be a grown up something and put down roots somewhere
9252889 i was on charlie rose with writer walter isaacson a local boy just five or so days after katrina hit and he was saying i fear for the neighborhoods because the specific neighborhoods the treme the ninth ward uptown the irish channel create these certain characters
9252890 most people saw that it wasnt going to be disney world
9252891 people were saying oh the third one is when everyone is getting over their post traumatic stress syndrome but when youre driving around seeing all that stuff there aint nothing post about it
9252892 the main phrase you used to hear in new orleans was whatcha gonna do so the city council is pretty corrupt whatcha gonna do we dont have a school system whatcha gonna do
9252893 well what were going to do is a lot theres plenty we can do
9252894 there is nothing like a big old piece of real estate and a lot of debt to let you know where you are
9252895 she was on them before she knew it and best we can tell she wasnt speeding
9252896 kind of a grey white just like a regular sheep
9252897 hes trying to impress these two small children and he says look those are a couple of sheep and i go how did you know that
9252898 i said thats the reason the chinese are trying to control tibet
9252899 he asked me how i happened to get a couple and i said i had a friend who had a friend who knew someone in the monastery and thats where i got them
9252900 i said what happens is i shave these sheep two or three times a year and then i sell the fur to the chinese consulate in houston
9252901 i was really trying to get crazier and crazier each time
9252902 he kinda winked at me cause there were these two small children there
9252903 god forbid if something happened to president mccain i think shed be up to the job
9252904 the presidency is an executive office and the governorship is an executive office and certainly that prepares her better than being one of 100 in the senate particularly if youve been in the senate less than four years
9252905 we just finished about two years of a lot of the people in this country telling us they wanted a woman on the ticket
9252906 they would miss a payment and youd ring them up and theyd say sorry well get that right for you and theyd catch it up then theyd miss another one and so on
9252907 we tried to communicate with them and ask what was happening but they went to ground and wouldnt talk
9252908 it allows us to build those bonds with the community and build that respect and bond between officers and the children
9252909 it is a program critical to helping kids arrive at their future and securing the future of our community
9252910 they werent afraid to come up and ask her a question even in my presence
9252911 not all your high school principals are ph d s
9252912 its proven that she improved johnston and that was a very troublesome school
9252913 she didnt keep anything from you no matter what time it was shed call me up and let me know
9252914 investors should keep their eyes on dividends not necessarily share prices
9252915 indeed squinting our eyes it looks the best survey this year
9252916 at the same time companies want to see them stronger still and that is why we are not seeing them leverage to pay out special dividends this year
9252917 they might put a cushion under them if the economy continues to soften but no more
9252918 but they need to be because there is probably more economic bad news to play out yet
9252919 and that is pretty unusual they are normally not slow to say how well they are going
9252920 we are still downgrading and likely to for several years this seasons earnings downgrades is as bad as its ever been
9252921 theyre little things but they really do make an impact
9252922 it takes a while to bring the community on board with these things and change habits
9252923 i was surprised how open i was i would be running routes and i would be running by myself sometimes
9252924 max did a good job of delivering the ball on target and seeing the field we just moved the ball well on offense and exploited their weaknesses on defense
9252925 as this team moves forward they might listen more closely to their coaches rather than the outside
9252926 its a great thing when a coach prepares a team and then his word is substantiated
9252927 we knew we could move the ball on them we had been doing it all game we just cant afford that many fumbles especially in one quarter i dont think that we panicked at all
9252928 so how does michigans defense compare to the ones you face in the wac
9252929 we have a veteran group and we know how to win
9252930 that is absurd to talk in those terms right now we have played one good football team and won one on the road which is nice but we have 11 left
9252931 its an abuse of power and they shouldnt be allowed to get away with it
9252932 doc thinks it can charge 20 000 a metre thats very expensive in anyones book
9252933 theres no relation between the amount and the effect on doc land
9252934 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9252935 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9252936 hello and happy friday before you head out to enjoy the weekend id like to ask for your help as you may know i am just about to complete my masters degree in management communications with a thesis on the topic of corporate blogging as an internal communications tool
9252937 today is the day when i am dumping microsoft office suite for good
9252938 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9252939 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9252940 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9252941 its a deadlock so we keep on protesting we are determined
9252942 this is a see saw battle it goes back and forth and we dont know how it will end
9252943 that royal trump card may allow samak to hold his ground
9252944 will gain momentum over the next year and an average drop of at least 10 is on the cards
9252945 as long as it doesnt go under 215 000 im not doing too badly
9252946 on the whole properties have come back but not by horrendous amounts
9252947 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9252948 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9252949 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9252950 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9252951 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9252952 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9252953 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252954 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252955 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252956 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252957 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252958 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252959 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252960 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252961 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252962 the only new but nonetheless absurd suggestion from the mdc was that cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai zanu pf dismissed that not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9252963 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9252964 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9252965 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9252966 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9252967 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9252968 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases
9252969 escalate tensions in europe through speculation over non existent threats to other former soviet republics
9252970 we want the european union to be united and react to this situation adequately it is clear now that this is not only about georgia it is about europes security
9252971 i can tell you that directing was maybe the happiest moment of my professional life just arriving on set i had a smile and it hasnt vanished until now
9252972 we never in real life tell stories in a linear way
9252973 i think that cinema is a very young medium and its beginning to find its own language and among these languages is the deconstruction of time
9252974 i have been obsessed with the weight of death over the living ones
9252975 my identity is constructed by the people that i love by the people that surround me every time one dies part of my identity is broken and lost i am obsessed at how that loss of someone that i love affects my own identity
9252976 im fascinated by how this industry survives how it struggles
9252977 i dont have to do it every time but its something that i really enjoy when i feel i meet people where were like minded and we walk the same road and tell the same story
9252978 especially i think now in her age more than when she was working in her 30s theres a strength with this leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch
9252979 this is a serious situation the nzru have been patient i hope they can exercise just a little more
9252980 i hope this doesnt escalate into something more serious i can understand the frustration but there are mitigating circumstances
9252981 whats more they say all the players who play in the final will be made available for the june tests if they are not injured
9252982 it should have been a 10 but im feeling so confident at the moment
9252983 we do think there will be a loss which impacts on the trust and beneficiaries
9252984 it is all very well to look back on a decision made in 2005 with the benefit of hindsight
9252985 we have come to a point where the lease has come to an end and it would be one of the challenges on developing the way forward
9252986 clearly we felt our action in terms of our original lease made sense otherwise we wouldnt have done it
9252987 my discussions with the public trust have confirmed the concerns that have been raised
9252988 i made some further subsequent checks to see if i could corroborate some of the information given to me and as a consequence have asked for a meeting with the minister for public trust
9252989 the concerns that have been raised with me deserve to be taken up with the minister in a very vigorous way
9252990 until december 2006 there was insufficient finance to meet all objects of the trust
9252991 one thing i would say is that the position moving forwards is significantly stronger today than it was in 2000
9252992 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9252993 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9252994 im not going to chance it not with my grandchild
9252995 the first year i did extremely well i got straight a pluses i didnt know i had a good brain when i was younger
9252996 all the time when i was studying you have these family things going on
9252997 their gut told them that it was a stupid thing to do but they went ahead and did it anyway
9252998 you have a one in 10 chance of dying with this treatment
9252999 you have a nine out of 10 chance of surviving this treatment
9253000 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9253001 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9253002 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9253003 even if youve ridden out this storm before even if you think that it may pass over even if you think that you can wait until the last minute this is going to be potentially very very serious and for your own safety your familys safety people have to follow the instructions of the officials there
9253004 do not ride out again ride out of town get out of town
9253005 will gain momentum over the next year and an average drop of at least 10 is on the cards
9253006 as long as it doesnt go under 215 000 im not doing too badly
9253007 on the whole properties have come back but not by horrendous amounts
9253008 i never was sure id be in this position davis who is in his sixth year of eligibility said last week
9253009 it was like a 50 50 chance im so excited to be part of this team again
9253010 i just wanted to come into this year with a whole new look to show everyone
9253011 weve done this in a way to defend the taxpayer and still be responsible
9253012 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9253013 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9253014 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9253015 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9253016 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9253017 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9253018 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9253019 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9253020 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9253021 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9253022 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9253023 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9253024 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is
9253025 its nice to have those mistakes happen and still win
9253026 its a great thing when a coach prepares his team and his word is substantiated
9253027 they might listen more closely to their coaches than to the outside
9253028 we call it the movement thats taking the nation by storm
9253029 you still have to be a tinkerer to make things work but thats changing
9253030 were going to see a lot more design features for recycled water and rainwater catchment
9253031 people dont think about where their water comes from or how much they use
9253032 on up and mid tempo pieces you dont necessarily expose yourself but on ballads and slow blues youve got matrix time to deal with
9253033 you have to really come to grips with whatever you are about you have to ask yourself am i being honest when the smoke all clears its really about coming to grips with oneself and how one presents that to the public
9253034 we were in this club and she was sitting at the piano and these are the two phrases she gave me and she said thats all shes going to give me
9253035 i woke up and wrote it down and then i came up with the rest
9253036 from a historical standpoint theres always been this evolution in jazz
9253037 julius made me really aware that far from discarding the previous generation theres always this continuum
9253038 we know we didnt do so well in nominating a president last time or the time before but give us another chance because were going in a different direction
9253039 social networks play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved organizations are run and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals
9253040 blogs and wikis have the opposite effect of keeping unique ideas down and may even inspire people to try harder at their jobs based on the increased visibility of their work
9253041 the aggies also have a qb making his first start daniel alfaro who is filling in for injured greg denham the uc davis offense has not been shut out in 200 games making it an interesting target for whats expected to be tomeys best defense at sjsu
9253042 sjsu hasnt dropped a home opener since a 24 17 loss to southern methodist in 2001
9253043 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9253044 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9253045 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9253046 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9253047 it shows a lot about our football team that we dug ourselves a pretty big hole against a good football team and we came out of it
9253048 presbyterian is a good team and they are going to win a lot of football games one of the big things for us was we made some adjustments defensively and basically told the guys to settle down and play your technique
9253049 i think offensively on the line of scrimmage we started to create some space and got the ball inside and outside then took it straight at them we had some big pass plays and i was pleased with the ways our kids got after it
9253050 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9253051 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her
9253052 she said that she yelled something like terry wait and this was at about the same time as she pushed on the door to try to get into the bathroom and at the same time she heard a shot
9253053 i fell in love with cheryl the first time we met
9253054 i let someone come between you i which should have never happened
9253055 i look back on everything see where i gave up love companion ship for attention affection it would be wonderful if i could turn back our lives for the past four years
9253056 if you live gods will and give with a happy heart you will reap the rewards
9253057 do you remember where you were 13 years ago on this day
9253058 he just wasnt the happy go lucky guy id known all my life
9253059 to keep cheryl in the style she wants to live
9253060 i always thought my uncle was in pretty good financial standing
9253061 it was just a shock to me that his finances were in that bad condition
9253062 one day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you
9253063 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9253064 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9253065 but id rather go to a political rally than a rock concert
9253066 whether you agree with him or not you know where he stands
9253067 if we dont have that we dont need to worry about the economy
9253068 were probably a couple weeks away from seeing him and making a determination on him we elected to keep an extra guy just so we make sure that when we go into baltimore i know ive got the right guy to suit up on sunday
9253069 hes never had that opportunity so this is his chance
9253070 this is what hes asked for and wanted hes worked extremely hard to return from his injury to have this opportunity and hes made good on it now its time so he has everything to play and it ought to be exciting to him
9253071 i dont think that had anything to do with the decision
9253072 the possibility of claiming a player or two at some point by noon today and well settle our practice squad
9253073 if you believe me i promise you that we will not just win ohio we will win this election you and i and joe biden we will change this country and we will change the world
9253074 we need change in this country and ohio and barack is committed to policies that i believe will move this country forward
9253075 they could have picked off any woman off any street corner and it would have been more appealing to women
9253076 but reform means you understand the problem and you have a strategy to deal with it
9253077 it shows a lot about our football team that we dug ourselves a pretty big hole against a good football team and we came out of it
9253078 presbyterian is a good team and they are going to win a lot of football games one of the big things for us was we made some adjustments defensively and basically told the guys to settle down and play your technique
9253079 i think offensively on the line of scrimmage we started to create some space and got the ball inside and outside then took it straight at them we had some big pass plays and i was pleased with the ways our kids got after it
9253080 throw shit against the wall and see how much sticks
9253081 it took a couple plays to get the jitters out but i had fun
9253082 i wasnt trying to hurt him just trying to put everything into my hit that i could
9253083 byus a tough team and i also want my team to play tough like that
9253084 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9253085 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9253086 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9253087 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9253088 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9253089 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9253090 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9253091 its a reminder bust your tail because it can be taken away from anybody
9253092 very tough he has been significant to me he has been significant to this organization beyond me
9253093 its important that we start our season healthy and ive made that very clear
9253094 fell off in 07 and we just havent seen a lot of change thus far this year
9253095 big willie meant a lot to the team hes going to go to another team and be very successful i wish him the best i just hope he doesnt come back and play against us
9253096 we were hitting people in the mouth flying all over the place we wanted to let the nation know that we are a fast and physical team
9253097 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9253098 it was one of the greatest feelings of my life
9253099 theyre a decent team in fact one we were worried about coming into tonight
9253100 ive been looking forward to this for a while now our team can be really good this year
9253101 this preseason ranking is a great place for us to start our climb
9253102 the senior class experience is strong and they have great leadership
9253103 we were hitting people in the mouth flying all over the place we wanted to let the nation know that we are a fast and physical team
9253104 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9253105 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9253106 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well
9253107 it just appears to be at this point a spontaneous thing with people who were not known to each other
9253108 they tried to get themselves to the hospital but they were stopped
9253109 based on some real preliminary information from one of our victims
9253110 they were great tonight they were special to do what this defense did tonight in this kind of rivalry was really special
9253111 ive always thought a i was one of the better junior linebackers in the state
9253112 we just thought that we needed to hang in there because we knew they were going to come out and be really physical with us
9253113 we had to hang in there and ride it out once we stopped making mistakes we were fine
9253114 andrei weve decided that bringing you off the bench will be best for the team
9253115 as soon as i saw it i threw my hands up i knew it was going in
9253116 im just going to delete the blocks from my memory
9253117 so how does michigans defense compare to the ones you face in the wac
9253118 we have a veteran group and we know how to win
9253119 that is absurd to talk in those terms right now we have played one good football team and won one on the road which is nice but we have 11 left
9253120 as this team moves forward they might listen more closely to their coaches rather than the outside
9253121 its a great thing when a coach prepares a team and then his word is substantiated
9253122 we knew we could move the ball on them we had been doing it all game we just cant afford that many fumbles especially in one quarter i dont think that we panicked at all
9253123 its been a long time coming and i know hes been very very frustrated with his injury situation because its lasted a lot longer than he anticipated and a lot longer than any of us anticipated so to get him back at full fitness and for him to have a game like that should mean great things for us and great things for fabian
9253124 im happy i got to spend so much time on the field
9253125 its a fantastic pass by javier morales and a fantastic right footed finish out of a guy who usually stands on his right foot
9253126 beautiful touch over the goalkeeprs head too a very very nice goal
9253127 maybe ill just change everything on the road and well do everything different including meals and when we train everything im willing to try anything at this point
9253128 for a long time she thought she was going to have a boy said wilsons older sister jermira spears 31
9253129 she was still happy about having the baby and had baby clothes bibs bottles and pampers all over the house
9253130 she talked so loud you could hear her all the way from eastmont mall or from the other end of the street
9253131 and it was obvious they didnt care who they hit
9253132 its so easy now to get a gun then a job spears said
9253133 there are folks who know who did this these lives have to count for something
9253134 the killers cant go unchecked there has to be an accounting for this the only way to prevent them from doing this again is to find them
9253135 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9253136 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9253137 it has the capacity to take out more ferret habitat than anything weve run up against and do it in such a short order
9253138 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9253139 were learning as we go we really dont know the answer to that yet
9253140 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9253141 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9253142 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9253143 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat
9253144 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9253145 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9253146 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9253147 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9253148 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9253149 in a loft that was a converted ice factory it had 40 foot ceilings it was gorgeous
9253150 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9253151 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9253152 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9253153 i dont want people to think the public defenders are the good guys and the das office are the bad guys
9253154 were going for the gray areas i hope people are entranced with what michelle does shes not someone you can root for all the time
9253155 ill get e mails written at 2 15 in the morning because people are awake and theyre furious theyre trying to call 911 theres fireworks people are making tons of noise and destroying the community
9253156 we want to help people too but were stuck we have to prioritize calls
9253157 however its only a matter of time before the stabbing happens up here
9253158 some of the members of the community have gotten so disgusted with the beach after going on their morning jog and having to pick up trash they just say forget it
9253159 the problem is the ownership of that whole area is a patchwork quilt
9253160 we cannot have davenport beach be a land anymore its not fair someone has to step up to the plate and say whose jurisdiction is davenport beach
9253161 its a matter of working together but were going to be real honest about what we can do
9253162 are you serious shane you cant get a hit off of ron fucking villone
9253163 jayson stark spoke to teams who characterized the ms demands as
9253164 we said tell you what well give bob some to take with him and how bout he drops it off on the way
9253165 zach braff comes in and says it smells like ass i say no it smells like cheese we eat cheese from everywhere france italy spain but the windsor blue is pretty much my favourite we used to buy it all the time and our local store said they couldnt get it any more so we emailed new zealand
9253166 it depends if they have to be in a bikini next week the cheese intake can change
9253167 we were like no we cant wait this is direct from new zealand this is special
9253168 im agnostic to the science and the debate about what the cause is
9253169 all i know is theres water where there didnt used to be
9253170 suggest eocene atmospheric co2 of the order of 1 000 p p m v falling to levels as low as 200 p p m v in the middle miocene
9253171 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9253172 once this storm gets in the gulf of mexico and people really see how big and dangerous it is thats going to help our efforts to encourage people to leave
9253173 i would be ecstatic if we could say correctly forecast half of the time 24 hours in advance a rapid change in intensity which is the big problem with our errors
9253174 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9253175 obviously its been a reasonably high profile campaign with fairly extensive marketing its good to see we had about six to eight bidders on each property
9253176 i think they probably reflect fair value in the current market
9253177 theres certainly more people that what i thought theres no doubt about that
9253178 we set ourselves a price and didnt go over that
9253179 didnt an all loving god destroy the cities of sodom and gomorrah
9253180 if it wasnt for gays your dad would have been lonely
9253181 just step out of the closet you wont get hurt
9253182 we can find common ground even on the hardest issues including abortion
9253183 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
9253184 are you so committed to a party that you would sanction murder
9253185 im a barber not a protester and this is ruining my business
9253186 if the ladies would go back into the kitchen there would be more jobs
9253187 with your mouth you cant keep a man youre a feminazi
9253188 choose christ and have eternal life or reject christ and burn in hell
9253189 i cant go back no home to go back to
9253190 we cant expect people without boots to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
9253191 because he was such a great orator he palmer gave the introductory speech warning us to knuckle down this is back when students were talking about taking over classrooms he was a little out of touch
9253192 the working class the folks who brought you the weekend
9253193 but do i have to choose either clinton or obama just because im black and ive got breasts hes not my president
9253194 i just want to put a smile on peoples faces
9253195 we dont want a repeat of 1968 we dont want broken heads
9253196 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
9253197 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
9253198 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9253199 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9253200 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
9253201 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that
9253202 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9253203 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9253204 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be cuba gooding jr
9253205 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9253206 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9253207 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
9253208 hed put his head where you wouldnt put your feet
9253209 i was surprised how open i was i would be running routes and i would be running by myself sometimes
9253210 max did a good job of delivering the ball on target and seeing the field we just moved the ball well on offense and exploited their weaknesses on defense
9253211 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
9253212 found the right partner to fight those who put their privilege ahead of their responsibility
9253213 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
9253214 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9253215 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9253216 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9253217 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9253218 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9253219 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9253220 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9253221 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9253222 were trying to win these ball games but were also trying to win the playoffs
9253223 i didnt think starting pitcher juan rafael was into it i know we clinched a playoff spot and who cares about these last regular season games but i dont think you can turn the switch on and off
9253224 i expected a day of being flat friday but we dont have time for that we have to get ready
9253225 weve done this in a way to defend the taxpayer and still be responsible
9253226 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9253227 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9253228 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9253229 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9253230 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9253231 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9253232 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9253233 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9253234 its a party that is four days long family friendly and free
9253235 families and couples who have been doing this for years pay out of their own pockets to participate
9253236 they would do the designing and labor and pick the flowers themselves
9253237 its just a jamboree were just happy we got our first real scrimmage we just wanted to get it done and have fun
9253238 he plays that way in practice too hes the pulse of the team he plays with emotion
9253239 we still have a long way to go the desire is there we need to work on technique more than anything
9253240 i was never confident i was going to score throughout the whole thing
9253241 it was kind of amongst some brush or a fallen tree contacted us right away we activated fraser valley search and rescue langley rcmp are on scene bc coroner service is on scene removing the body
9253242 aba we have a photo of you and ima standing in front of this building
9253243 weve invited some special guests out here from the community
9253244 sign up and receive my posts the minute theyre posted
9253245 all of a sudden its the democrats who rejected a woman for the ticket and the republicans who added a woman to the ticket so all of a sudden its back to the drawing board
9253246 this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9253247 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9253248 what ive had to do though is in the middle of the night put down the blackberries and pick up the breast pump do a couple of things different and still get it all done
9253249 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9253250 she knows daycare issues she has a disabled child she knows healthcare issues shes a very good choice
9253251 the environmental movement and issues are top of mind now and theres a lot of politicians who are positioning themselves who are now trying to be become part of the movement or at least paint themselves as green
9253252 this is only happening because our foreign policy in the middle east is provoking blowback
9253253 and when american bombers kill tens of thousands of people from high in the air is that any better
9253254 hundreds of pencils cut them into 1 inch sections drill a hole in each section to turn them into beads sharpen them all and sew them together
9253255 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
9253256 and unto the judge that shall be in those days
9253257 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and governor youre no hillary clinton

9253259 it just appears to be at this point a spontaneous thing with people who were not known to each other

9253269 when it gets right down to it it really became just a durability issue
9253270 i believe that moran will do well wherever he goes
9253271 i think somebody who is looking for a fullback will find a very good player in moran that was a difficult cut today
9253272 he is a jack of all trades at this point probably a master of none
9253273 when you take the total package of michael robinson he is pretty valuable to your football team
9253274 he wasnt pushing for the job as we may have hoped
9253275 we have some decent defensive backs and i didnt want to put them out there in the street to someone elses benefit
9253276 what sarah palin promised to do during the general election when she was running against another corrupt alaskan politician in this case democrat tom knowles is pretty immaterial
9253277 if alaska wanted a bridge they would build it themselves
9253278 it was rather egregious harassment and there were real problems with the investigation of her complaint and preventing it from happening
9253279 we think its a good result and that we will have improved performance as an employer by sizzler
9253280 a long history of supporting diversity among its workforce and we take very seriously our responsibility to provide a workplace free of harassment
9253281 out of everything that could happen he didnt fall or get beat up by some screwed up parents it was something as innocent as a grape said his mother christine farrow
9253282 it should be clear that this doesnt mean we think this was appropriate care nishagaya said
9253283 judea made us look at life in a different way bolian said
9253284 i think hes in there as a matter of fact i think he is capable of anything i dont listen to everything the doctors say what can i do give up on him
9253285 when they get behind the wheel and they get to wear the captains hat they feel in charge
9253286 some of them have never been in charge of anything in their whole lives
9253287 last summer we tried hershey park but it was a disaster
9253288 i wanted to retire and i wanted to go sailing
9253289 but i didnt want to go sailing and be a bum for the rest of my life i needed a purpose
9253290 i wanted to do 20 sites in five years one site every quarter
9253291 it really is a learning experience for the kids and the parents
9253292 i was pretty well blown away by the work they were doing
9253293 you have to decide what you want to do with your life
9253294 i love the boy but i do not want to die with him
9253295 one of these days ill get one of those sticks that he used
9253296 im still shocked whenever i see him like a little kid im like is that the same guy who made all those catches triples were part of his game and theyve always been part of mine too
9253297 a triple is one of the most majestic things in baseball everyone loves a triple i know i do i hit two of em
9253298 those balls he hits 420 feet to right center field at our place
9253299 any time i hit a ball off the fence im thinking about a triple im looking to get three or four more
9253300 for a long time she thought she was going to have a boy said wilsons older sister jermira spears 31
9253301 she was still happy about having the baby and had baby clothes bibs bottles and pampers all over the house
9253302 she talked so loud you could hear her all the way from eastmont mall or from the other end of the street
9253303 and it was obvious they didnt care who they hit

9253310 ill get e mails written at 2 15 in the morning because people are awake and theyre furious theyre trying to call 911 theres fireworks people are making tons of noise and destroying the community
9253311 we want to help people too but were stuck we have to prioritize calls
9253312 however its only a matter of time before the stabbing happens up here
9253313 some of the members of the community have gotten so disgusted with the beach after going on their morning jog and having to pick up trash they just say forget it
9253314 the problem is the ownership of that whole area is a patchwork quilt
9253315 we cannot have davenport beach be a land anymore its not fair someone has to step up to the plate and say whose jurisdiction is davenport beach
9253316 its a matter of working together but were going to be real honest about what we can do
9253317 let me assure you that dr treadway and i have communicated about the presidency here at ohlone
9253318 today we are the michael phelps of education and sustainability
9253319 im very very happy for her it was a very dramatic case
9253320 we are kind of concerned about our safety out there nobody wants to respond
9253321 i have a job to do i have been told to uphold the rules of the courts and when i do i have been threatened and bullied
9253322 honestly not an emergency she was told we have something else going on right now and we arent going to be able to respond as quickly as we would like to
9253323 the bottom line though is they know its not allowed to do that sport on the tennis courts
9253324 im not asking parks and recreation to police it but when you call the police you kind of hope and expect for them to show up you know its pleasant hill what else are they doing
9253325 were not the park and rec security or complaint resolution department
9253326 the third time she had a bag in her hands
9253327 we want to make sure shes ok then sort out the legal ramifications
9253328 to try to avoid being pulled in one direction or another to be in a sense used by one side or the other

9253353 we want to help people too but were stuck we have to prioritize calls
9253354 however its only a matter of time before the stabbing happens up here
9253355 some of the members of the community have gotten so disgusted with the beach after going on their morning jog and having to pick up trash they just say forget it
9253356 the problem is the ownership of that whole area is a patchwork quilt
9253357 we cannot have davenport beach be a land anymore its not fair someone has to step up to the plate and say whose jurisdiction is davenport beach
9253358 its a matter of working together but were going to be real honest about what we can do
9253359 weve invited some special guests out here from the community
9253360 to come out with a w from the big house would mean a lot to the team
9253361 we have aspirations of a bcs bowl so we need to get a win its a must win
9253362 it didnt do us any favors having appalachian state going in there and whacking them like they did

9253369 its gotta be location because my stuff is there and my velocity hasnt dropped
9253370 i must be throwing beach balls out there the sad part is im getting ahead of everybody im just not sealing anything up its an embarrassment when we score this many runs and cant get a win
9253371 i thought we were going to lose in the last two minutes
9253372 as soon as i saw it i threw my hands up i knew it was going in
9253373 im just going to delete the blocks from my memory
9253374 its nice to have those mistakes happen and still win
9253375 its a great thing when a coach prepares his team and his word is substantiated
9253376 they might listen more closely to their coaches than to the outside
9253377 it took a couple plays to get the jitters out but i had fun
9253378 i wasnt trying to hurt him just trying to put everything into my hit that i could
9253379 byus a tough team and i also want my team to play tough like that
9253380 i was surprised how open i was i would be running routes and i would be running by myself sometimes
9253381 max did a good job of delivering the ball on target and seeing the field we just moved the ball well on offense and exploited their weaknesses on defense
9253382 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9253383 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well

9253396 the fbi investigations of alaska lawmakers were going on before she got elected
9253397 as this team moves forward they might listen more closely to their coaches rather than the outside
9253398 its a great thing when a coach prepares a team and then his word is substantiated

9253441 the third time she had a bag in her hands
9253442 we want to make sure shes ok then sort out the legal ramifications
9253443 the offensive line gave me enough time and the defense stepped up big
9253444 sometimes being 6 foot 4 he does not look like he can run the ball but hes a good runner its nice when you have a guy that can do that
9253445 im a soccer player so im sort of foreign to this whole deal its real nerve wracking i just had to get that first one under my belt to start the season off i tried to be more mentally prepared this week
9253446 i put last week in the past and from now on i hope its positive

9253532 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9253533 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell arsene wenger the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9253534 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9253535 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9253536 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede

9253551 some of our partners might like to freeze the process but we want to carry on

9253589 its funny shes very lazy and brian will tell you that
9253590 the last six weeks she has been very aggressive in her warmup which is not like her but shes been racing good
9253591 she missed half the year last year with throat problems and to come back from that proves how good she is
9253592 she has raced with the best all her life shes just a great mare theres no question about it
9253593 she had a great trip and at the top of the lane there was a lot of room and she took off
9253594 he just didnt keep his mind on his work right through the wire last year and it was certainly disappointing for myself and all of his connections
9253595 i wanted to get away a little closer to the front but i didnt think the no 1 and no 2 up front ben and knight of intrigue respectively would show as much gate speed as they did
9253596 when they were going out of there hard it kind of forced me to re adjust my thinking
9253597 i saw arch madness coming from the outside so i knew the first quarter and even the half were going to be decent fractions i was fortunate to get cover around the last turn following enough talk and when i tipped him out he did the rest
9253598 i have town hall meetings all over the country all of the time and i know how people are hurting
9253599 probably the best place all around of any site on the east coast
9253600 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9253601 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9253602 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9253603 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9253604 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9253605 weve seen him stick the end of his trunk in his mouth and suck on his trunk which is funny because hes breathing through it at the time so it gets a reaction out of him and he also picks up sticks
9253606 once when rose tu lay down the calf nestled between her feet almost as if to
9253607 rose tu and her calf have been together since 5 p m last night
9253608 the staff has been working day and night to help ensure this critical reintroduction is successful
9253609 at one point the calf was in the wrong place and rose tu gently nudged him with her trunk repositioning her legs so he could get better access for nursing
9253610 she seems especially calm around him and when he nurses it looks like rose is almost sleeping shes so relaxed its a very good sign
9253611 from the behavioral signs weve seen thus far were very hopeful that the reintroduction will be successful
9253612 when we brought the calf in the very first time she tried her best to get to it by breaking chains and breaking chains means she could potentially be free and posed a threat to her calf and the staff
9253613 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9253614 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9253615 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9253616 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9253617 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9253618 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf
9253619 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9253620 shes like a little sister to me its a relief to spend time with her an outlet im like a really big kid
9253621 we want to take the time to make good matches not just increase our numbers
9253622 youll need a wheelchair because ill still be whupping you at basketball
9253623 when you first give of yourself you dont always realize how much youll get back
9253624 several women and children exited the compound and were moved to a safe area at which time coalition forces again came under ak 47 and rpg fire
9253625 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9253626 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9253627 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9253628 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9253629 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9253630 im very happy i knew it was a tough match
9253631 i will just focus on my next match because every match is difficult hes playing very well i will have to play very well if i want to advance
9253632 i had a good passing shot on a break point that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9253633 i won the first set that was cool after the first set i was pretty pumped up
9253634 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too so i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9253635 reprisals on the military joint task force responsible for the killings of men women and children from their so called warning shots in the inland waterways to punitive expeditions on oil bearing communities
9253636 from our count the predominantly ethnic northern jtf lost a total of 29 soldiers in the combined assault we can not account for those that jumped into the water in panic and drowned we lost six of our gallant fighters
9253637 the deadly soviet made anti tank missiles at close range combat
9253638 to witness the wreck of gunboats which were still burning when we left to forestall any denial by the military

9253665 this is my simple religion there is no need for temples no need for complicated philosophy our own brain our own heart is our temple the philosophy is kindness

9253667 green capsule is a portable plant cultivation kit and part of a line of lohas products from boford lohas means sustainable lifestyle choose from cabbage basil green pepper and cherry tomato seeds
9253668 i wake up in the morning and i think oh boy whats he going to tell me today
9253669 thats the alternative a hook and release sports fishery it will be a tourist centred business
9253670 we are working with debbie and her management to discuss collaborative opportunities
9253671 we think she looks amazing we think she really resonates with women everywhere
9253672 eg brown skinned doll removed but angry mood wearing dresses princess
9253673 for their incisive vision sumptuous textures and colors and the sheer wonder these finely detailed descriptions of butterflies awaken in us i think rick sammons photographs are marvels
9253674 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9253675 we primarily address the enterprise market so we would certainly look for voice enterprise when it comes out
9253676 i wanted to tell you that i have been very pleased with tooth soap im one of those people getting a cleaning every 3 months i just had one done my pockets are shrinking i had gum surgery on my back teeth about 15 years ago the area was always very sensitive when i had a cleaning its much improved now im switching from a 3 month to 6 month cleaning i have the dental hygienist interested in the product too im also using it on my pug so far so good
9253677 i looked at the tragedy and what i had in my mind i wanted to put it on paper
9253678 i wanted it to make sense i wanted people to look at it and understand i dont do abstract
9253679 i think it turned out better than what i had to begin with
9253680 even if i dont sell a lot of prints if the families of those victims who went through a lot see my painting and believe that the victims are in gods hands now that theyre safe thats good enough for me
9253681 id give this position 110 percent because thats what it deserves
9253682 i have spoken with the police and it is believed that these incidents are adolescent in nature and that the vandals have mostly targeted vehicles that are unlocked
9253683 orchard park is not being hit any more than some other areas
9253684 but if people can keep their cars locked and off the streets if at all possible it will help
9253685 this is the first year where we are being much more proactive
9253686 although science is important we have not emphasized science in the primary grades
9253687 she was kind very kind i should have been as nice as she was
9253688 anyone could walk in and sit down at her dining room table everyone always left feeling better she had that knack
9253689 a lot of really great friends came out of that job
9253690 but at that point the pastor and others would come here to see her
9253691 she loved to go dancing with my dad especially at the senior center
9253692 she actually joined when she was still in her 20s both her and my aunt
9253693 she was active for over 30 years in it cooking for funerals and weddings and parties taking care of the firemen and doing fundraising
9253694 my mother loved playing the card game 500 you have to be a good strategist to play that game she was good at it
9253695 i guess you could say i was drafted into the army band of the 19th century
9253696 during battle once soldiers were injured the band would be given the order to stack their instruments and help with medical care
9253697 it was the only time in america history that a band would have been used in that sense they werent equipped to do fighting so they helped care for the wounded
9253698 they were ordered to not play songs reminiscent of home
9253699 those songs got the troops too homesick and some soldiers left and went home
9253700 the band director looked at me and said i need a tuba player and youre that guy
9253701 i have always loved music and loved performing i guess im a ham my wife says its because i have a big ego
9253702 but music is an aesthetic part of life you can escape the everyday part of life with music you can go somewhere magical
9253703 all the people of the world have a vital need for liberty
9253704 i never knew a man who wished to be himself a slave consider if you know any good thing that no man desires for himself
9253705 the role of the brass band during the civil war
9253706 i truly believe it will happen i truly believe it will be built and it will be what everyone thinks it should be
9253707 we all agree its going to be a huge anchor for the borough
9253708 were just very excited that things are really starting to roll now and everything is starting to fall into place
9253709 the library is the centerpiece of any town its going to draw people into this area whove never been here before
9253710 people would love to see that shovel in the ground and so would we its been a long process
9253711 lets light up the map and lets light a path for americas future
9253712 the bulk of information being sought is unprecedented and too broad for us to commit weeks worth of work to gathering and verifying
9253713 we have some issues and we are addressing those issues
9253714 were not afraid to look at ourselves warts and all
9253715 s t a l k e r clear sky discs recalled
9253716 were scared to death were going through katrina again here
9253717 were getting out even if its going to cost a couple hundred dollars in gas
9253718 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9253719 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9253720 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9253721 she was out there with then young son track pulling him around from house to house in a wagon
9253722 shes not afraid to speak her mind she really dropped the hammer on the politicians fleecing alaska
9253723 shes an excellent social conservative fiscal conservative and political conservative
9253724 if she can energize the conservative base it wont matter if she gets the womens vote
9253725 this is a really nice person and shes disarming in that way
9253726 she did some housecleaning with her department heads she had to learn about the sewers the libraries public safety
9253727 im still leaning toward obama i think sarah has been really good for our state and it would be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9253728 if it was her running for president thered be no question in my mind
9253729 the republicans right now are about big business and big oil i dont see sarah as a staunch republican in that way
9253730 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9253731 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9253732 rangel pissed off his largely pro obama constituency by backing hillary clinton in the democratic primary
9253733 craig schley an activist and former male model found 5 580 people in the last month who want rangel out of office and were willing to sign the petitions he needs to become an independent candidate for the congressmans seat
9253734 so i fell into old masters which were relatively plentiful at the time and not very expensive
9253735 that was 25 years ago and by 2007 i had 1 500 drawings instead of around 250 i was seriously off plan
9253736 because i could not decide on part all of it had to go
9253737 you have an obligation to look after it properly its part of the cultural patrimony of the world
9253738 theyre for shopping not collecting trouble is people have money but not the time
9253739 with the pending general election the olympics kids going back to school and the holidays ending its a bad time and probably the reason why the hall wasnt packed tonight
9253740 some of the men were really quite boring the only man with any passion was genest
9253741 i thought he was really well spoken but i would have liked to see the questions divided more evenly it was really dominated by liberals and the ndp
9253742 people dont seem to be as bound to the liberal party as they were which is good thing
9253743 im dismayed by the fact that the people of westmount are endeared to the liberals and that they cant open their minds to voting for someone who may bring this community a chance to develop
9253744 i think anne was even better than i hoped she would be
9253745 she understands people and she answers questions directly and clearly
9253746 una donna racconta la sua vita i suoi complicati e misteriosi amori per cercare di capire il confine tra realt e apparenza tra verit e menzogna tra torto e ragione
9253747 they agreed its needed thats why were so terribly disappointed in the pennsylvania decision
9253748 west virginia agreed that you cant look at a regional project in a vacuum
9253749 a grandiose answer to a minor or even non existent problem
9253750 based on our review of the entire record we have concluded that little or no need for reinforcement exists and or non intrusive options are available and probably should have been put in place before now
9253751 granting approval of the 502 junction to virginia segment at this juncture rewards a lack of foresight and proper maintenance and has policy implications for the location of future generation
9253752 we are understandably pleased with the conclusion of the judges who confirmed that these lines are not needed for reliability and are not in the best interest of pennsylvania
9253753 the future of pennsylvanias energy independence is dependent on forward thinking clear eyed decisions such as this
9253754 we stand by both projects because we feel they are needed
9253755 we need new lines thats what it really comes down to whether you want them in your backyard or not
9253756 we are discussing that i cant make a clear comment
9253757 ci arrivai quando cera il fascismo che ora sta tornando in abiti nuovi
9253758 divertente qui alla mostra del cinema ma per il resto fu una sciagura
9253759 garrone e sorrentino sono bravi e tra ventanni li celebrete come adesso fate con me
9253760 s ci sto da anni anzi la prima volta ci sono stato negli anni trenta lei non ci creder ma allora avevo gi let che ha lei adesso trovai in affitto una camera ammobiliata aveva lingresso scala cio indipendente in modo da poterci portare anche persone non frequentabili e poi ancora adesso entrando nei negozi del rione tutti mi accolgono in modo civile senza particolare riguardo e senza pretendere nulla da me mentre giravamo gli abitanti sono stati molto collaborativi ma senza smancerie
9253761 e pi grande pi affollata con pi divertimenti quando ci arrivai io negli anni trenta dopo le nove e mezzo di sera era gi tutto buio
9253762 forse il fascismo sta tornando non esplicitamente ma con un altro vestito e sta tornando anche la povert di allora ma allora eravamo tutti poveri oggi la povert non viene accettata
9253763 litalia una barca che due generazioni di classe dirigente hanno ormai portato alla deriva per salvarla ci vorrebbe un nuovo equipaggio dalla generazione precedente abbiamo ereditato la corruzione che si prolunga fino a ora non c pi musica non c pi letteratura non c danza c solo qualche sussulto al cinema ma in generale non c pi nulla
9253764 no quella stata una rivolta dei figli contro i padri i genitori insegnavano loro a rispettare la scuola a tirare la cinghia mentre i ragazzi hanno detto basta divertiamoci consumiamo e stata quella la generazione che ci ha trascinato nel consumismo attuale la gente invece di imparare a lavorare pensa a comprarsi la ducati
9253765 s cero facevo parte dellanac lassociazione degli autori che contestava la gestione dellepoca facemmo una manifestazione alternativa volevamo fare un cinema diverso fu divertente ricordo zavattini trascinato via i distinguo di pasolini allora almeno era unitalia molto combattiva oggi c il pensiero unico
9253766 lui una persona stimabile e poi la sandrelli ha dichiarato che il suo un film potente un aggettivo meraviglioso
9253767 aspettiamo che diventino vecchi anche garrone e sorrentino ho visto i loro ultimi film belli o virz marra amoruso e vedrete che applaudirete anche loro bisogna avere pazienza ci vogliono altri ventanni certo non tutti i film possono venir bene io ne ho fatti 65 ma ne vengono ricordati al massimo due quindi 63 non erano buoni il problema anche la distribuzione gli esercenti sono dei bottegai insomma siamo in mano ai salumai
9253768 e la mia ossessione pi vecchio pi bravo di me e ha fatto anche pi festival e pi sveglio e attivo perch viene dal circo equestre non vedo lora che scompaia scherza io invece vengo dalla portineria e faccio fatica anche a camminare a monti
9253769 per adesso non sto lavorando ma spero ancora di realizzare unidea che ho in mente da cinquantanni senza riuscire mai a farla non ho voglia per di parlarne sembrerei presuntuoso
9253770 i dont think anyone will go into a store to buy it just for the youtube support but it will be a nice extra when customers are trying to decide between two models
9253771 weve got to find a way to win these games
9253772 because winning one game here or there is not going to cut it
9253773 as a pitcher i dont think we want to intentionally walk anybody
9253774 in the same respect youve got to do the smart thing
9253775 we do have to find a way to be more consistent than weve been
9253776 everything is fine theres no excuses basically thats not a mistake youve got to give credit to him
9253777 i guess he wasnt too happy that i hit him
9253778 i hit him with two strikes i actually did him a favor i told him that i was right here he got a little more fired up when there were 24 men behind him
9253779 i was letting him know i wasnt going to take it im just tired of getting hit
9253780 women could stop using body creams and perfumes although we do not have conclusive evidence that they do harm there are components about which there are question marks for example it could be certain combinations of chemicals
9253781 i tried to upgrade but everything in business was taken
9253782 people found out who i was and so they were all coming to the back of the plane to get pictures of my medals
9253783 the princes will be remembering the princess privately and in their own way
9253784 suspension from membership of the party is a serious matter which will stand on councillor hanifs record in relation to all future activity
9253785 pigeons are at present being dropped in occupied territory by parachute
9253786 it appears that this incident took place following an argument at a party at this property
9253787 we are appealing for anyone who was at the address during the course of this party to come forward and make contact with the police
9253788 house to house inquiries are ongoing and there is a high visibility police presence in the area
9253789 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9253790 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9253791 its part of a round of next steps in our park improvement plan
9253792 theyve been using them quite a bit and theyve been damaging the trails making it harder for walkers and runners to use them
9253793 weve invested a lot of money in those areas recently and they are getting damaged from people parking there
9253794 you take the condition of a person who already had seizures you can easily stimulate that problem with that type of device
9253795 although the additional finding that i find myself emphasizing is its not 100 percent safe
9253796 when you feel you need to lay hands on somebody to control them physically you are authorized to use a taser
9253797 theres going to be a high level of injury the reason the taser is so effective in law enforcement is because it reduces and minimizes that type of injury
9253798 its taken longer but were getting a much better trail as a result
9253799 the projects along the mon wharf are all major construction projects that cost a lot of money and require a lot of permits
9253800 what im saying now is that this trail will be worth the wait
9253801 the switchback is a major project because of the vertical distance and also because we want the ramp system to meet universal access standards
9253802 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9253803 we believe we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9253804 we have contributed to the infrastructure in peters township for many years
9253805 small and mid sized arts organizations go up and down because theyre usually based on the work of a small amount of people
9253806 thats whats so sad about it what they were already bringing to the company and losing people who were already dedicated
9253807 now i will be moving back and forth because i see things in this area are a little off balance
9253808 were very open to new students and we want to do whatever we can to bring them in but it takes a lot of dedication
9253809 people come into this and think its like sweating to the oldies but its a philosophy in life
9253810 its a holistic life changing art thats what separates it from other arts it demands you to become more conscious of other people and of how you carry yourself which is what martial arts are about in the first place
9253811 you have to have discipline respect and you learn about your african culture
9253812 i am a threat to no one mr obama doesnt trump my constitutional rights the president of the united states doesnt trump my constitutional rights
9253813 i had a bible in one hand and an apple in the other i was going to pass out my fliers on the rights of law abiding americans to carry guns but i never got the chance
9253814 our people did talk to him he never entered the event area
9253815 they cuffed me and it wasnt fun my arms are as big as sewer pipes
9253816 didnt even give me a receipt for it there were lots of violations of my constitutional rights
9253817 the right of the people to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state shall not be questioned
9253818 i didnt think id get within a mile of the rally
9253819 i actually like sen obama but i havent made up my mind on whether im going to vote for him or for senator john mccain
9253820 not having a good day unless she is making a big government liberal miserable
9253821 politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests people expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
9253822 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9253823 we believe we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9253824 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
9253825 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags
9253826 and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics but there is a whole in between area that doesnt get talked about
9253827 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9253828 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9253829 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9253830 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9253831 i wouldnt call it a nightmare but it is a very perplexing challenge
9253832 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9253833 you gotta make as much money as you can because when we shut down and were gonna shut down thats it for a long while
9253834 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9253835 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess
9253836 our boss was into playing his trumpet down here more than he was into running a business so that all kinda went to hell and now im working here
9253837 ive never been through one and im not sure what to believe you see the national weather people and theyre telling you its gonna be really bad
9253838 i dont leave for nothing i didnt even leave for katrina
9253839 i mean look at the local weather guys they know what theyre doing not those weather channel people the local people say its gonna move north and thats enough for me
9253840 lot of folks around here are gonna make do with what they have and you wont hear a terrible amount of complaining
9253841 you cant just come in here and expect to hear people fussing about how they dont have nothing people just be used to not having much and so you dont even think too hard about it until someone starts asking you questions
9253842 now what do you think that would look like me and my little car sitting there in traffic with two big old rottweilers
9253843 guess im just gonna wait i just dont know its all stressful
9253844 its hard to explain to someone whos not from here why anyone would choose to stay
9253845 as long as i have power im good probably wont have power for long but this place is pretty tough
9253846 when you stand out there by that river and look at that levee
9253847 you are just so blessed to live here i am in love and so i make my choice
9253848 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9253849 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9253850 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9253851 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9253852 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9253853 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9253854 i think it is important that government ministers and particularly me as chancellor level with people
9253855 i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations
9253856 who is telling the truth at the top of government the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9253857 whenever the ball is within the 1 2 or 3 yard line thats the goal of the defense to pin our ears back to get that safety
9253858 if you have two safeties in a game you did a pretty good job of just getting off the ball whether its on runs or on sacks
9253859 shes continued the extractive political ideology that has defined alaska for decades
9253860 theres a long history of trying to get this pipeline in place
9253861 alaska has always been a storehouse of resources but sometimes its extremely expensive to get the storehouse to open and move the resources to market
9253862 hes the center of the offense the center of the team
9253863 he knows our offense well really well hes going to make excellent decisions
9253864 thats what i wanted to do come in and give it my best shot and try to make the team
9253865 is it one week or three weeks i cant tell you well just have to wait and see
9253866 i always felt being a free agent you dont have any room for mistakes so you always have to go out and play your best game
9253867 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
9253868 please advise your colleagues that petes house is actually sturmy house that house is the property of the trustees of savernake estate and any such thing would certainly constitute a breach of his lease of our property so should dohertys manager ever plan to carry out his threat please be advised in advance that there are absolutely no circumstances in which the owners of that house where doherty lives would ever sanction such a thing
9253869 john did come to see my show britt on britt we went for dinner and had a great time but it wasnt just me and him theres no romance on the cards
9253870 you will pay attention when i leave the union for
9253871 puntland state of somalias main ethnic group hence making ownership claims to the flag on tribal grounds
9253872 i couldnt do this last year i couldnt even do this six months ago thank you
9253873 after the live aid set there were no congratulatory hugs or smiles it was as if we were foreign from each other this would be the last time we played together in two decades
9253874 constant bickering and hostility had left the atmosphere acrid with tension we were tired of the incendiary arguments the dark depressions the bitter resentments we were tired of the 24 hour attention
9253875 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band
9253876 all of the follows family and close friends have been contacted weve filled a missing persons report and have reached out to the australian consulate for guidance
9253877 once we get together as a band and decide our fate im sure azaria will make a statement explaining himself
9253878 he served his country and he did a good job as a serviceman i will honour him for that but he is not presidential material
9253879 we enjoyed an incredible international convention this year which included many exciting announcements
9253880 we now provide our independent associates with two additional ways to earn income through their home based usana business we believe this announcement along with our new product rev3 energy will be key drivers of usanas future growth and our associates success
9253881 it is a privilege for the sunedison board of directors to engage with martin considering his financial and auditing experience across industries with both public and privately held companies
9253882 he is deeply committed to board work guiding companies that define their industries i have worked closely with martin on several boards and i am pleased that he is bringing his expertise and guidance to sunedison in our efforts to create long term value for our customers
9253883 i am looking forward to working with sunedison a pioneer and an industry leader of the solar energy services model
9253884 as a member of the board of directors and chairman of the audit committee i look forward to providing guidance as the company focuses on fully managed long term solar solutions for its customers
9253885 continued statements that everything is fine with the 787 global supply network just dont fly
9253886 its time for boeing to stop the lip service and take real action
9253887 face the fact that the global network is a failure and bring the critical work back so the experienced employees can get the 787 back on track
9253888 instead of thanking and rewarding employees for correcting the errors of suppliers and management boeing is banking profits and shifting costs onto employees
9253889 alltel takes very seriously our responsibility to ensure our customers stay connected to friends and family during hurricane gustav
9253890 alltel has made significant investments in its wireless network to improve coverage and reliability and we have once again taken all the necessary steps to prepare for gustav
9253891 the major difference with the qosmio is that its just smoother and more advanced tracking technology
9253892 we are discussing that i cant make a clear comment
9253893 we primarily address the enterprise market so we would certainly look for voice enterprise when it comes out
9253894 unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office
9253895 mom did you and dad get married to have me
9253896 i went to a doctor you know babies come from hospitals
9253897 does everyone who wants a baby go to a doctor
9253898 so where does the doctor get all the sperms from
9253899 i never gave it much thought i always imagined there were vets to help all animals even wild ones
9253900 we the people of alaska grateful to god and to those who founded our nation and pioneered this great land
9253901 it is impossible to build an empire without our fathers aid i believe the sacred writings which say that except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it
9253902 animated alone by the pure spirit of christianity and conducting ourselves as the faithful subjects of our free government we may enjoy every temporal and spiritual felicity
9253903 can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed the conviction that these liberties are the gift of god
9253904 the diffusion of the light of christianity in our nation
9253905 righteousness alone can exalt a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people
9253906 that it is the mutual duty of all to practice christian forebearance love and charity towards each other
9253907 that is the single most important thing needs to do in the convention
9253908 he has to make clear he not only is not george bush but that he would not govern like george bush
9253909 hes got to try to soften some of the gop negatives
9253910 i cant f king stand that f king song every time i have to sing it i want to gag problem is it was a big big tune for us
9253911 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris friday august 29 due to illness she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9253912 when the cuban authorities put evacuations in place tour operators will follow them to the letter
9253913 hurricane season happens every year so they are used to dealing with it and they deal with it well
9253914 when you dont want to be in a place you just dont want to be in a place he was here for eight years he got tired of being here
9253915 i got like 17 walks on the last road trip
9253916 manny is happy no more controversy between him and the team
9253917 when you dont want to be in a place you just dont want to be in a place he was here for eight years he got tired of being here
9253918 we were getting our butts kicked by anaheim and the yankees and everybody was pointing the finger at manny
9253919 i saw manny running 5 9 a lot of times
9253920 we dont ever try to play great in games we try to play to our capabilities and do it every game thats why we can go across the country into a hostile environment and play so well we dont care where the score goes we just play
9253921 he can strike deep in a heartbeat and we havent had that in the last few years
9253922 john david booty was very conservative and that was fine but mark has that attitude to just seize it he had two deep ball opportunities and hit them both
9253923 mark has unusual qualities and our job as coaches when you have someone with unusual qualities is to bring those qualities to the forefront
9253924 we wanted what they had and that was the fields
9253925 i was very upset because its not right you cannot profit on a public property
9253926 its one thing to exchange field time with a neighboring team without exchanging money
9253927 but when someone is trying to make a business out of it then it becomes fraud
9253928 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9253929 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9253930 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9253931 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9253932 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the
9253933 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9253934 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9253935 we were told by winehouses agent at 8pm that she would not be there and we were forced to cancel the performance
9253936 we have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence
9253937 it appears that this incident took place following an argument at a party at this property
9253938 we are appealing for anyone who was at the address during the course of this party to come forward and make contact with the police
9253939 the family are lovely i dont know if it was a party and i havent really heard any parties the two lads who live there are nice
9253940 we were all looking outside at 7am this morning and there was an ambulance and seven or eight police officers everyone was looking out shocked its a nice street
9253941 i was born in shreveport louisiana and my parents still live there so i know first hand how hurricanes can disrupt the lives of family and friends
9253942 we want to quickly get the word out to our customers in louisiana and texas who may need to temporarily relocate out of the area and provide them with some relief during this difficult time
9253943 one of the primary reasons for the loss of wireless service in a hurricane is the loss of commercial power to the cell site
9253944 neither caused terrible damage but they were serious and our crews got a good workout
9253945 the crews got in fast with generators and it was very impressive every storm that happens including katrina presents lessons to be learned
9253946 a power hungry tyrant uses venezuelas oil supply to overthrow the government and turns the country into a war zone
9253947 at the end of the day you have to remind yourself its a damned video game
9253948 it is time the venezuelan people stop paying for the greed of foreign interests we will make them pay dearly for our oil from this day forward everybody pays
9253949 the purchaser is cooperating with charnwood and has stated that the data has not been distributed to any other parties
9253950 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter we have worked vigorously to investigate the case i am pleased that we have quickly been able to identify and track down the hard drive and deal with the situation appropriately
9253951 many of these are similarly compromised through the selective rendering removal or adaptation of complex content such as flash and java in the network into a form consumable by the device but not necessarily representative of the web developers full intent
9253952 limited device capabilities often slow connections to the internet and a legacy of efforts to capture a web style experience through the use of wap continue to limit the ability of todays mobile devices to fully render web content themselves
9253953 were committed to making google apps premier edition a service on which your organization can depend during the first half of august we didnt do this as well as we should have
9253954 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
9253955 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
9253956 if you install internet explorer 8 beta 2 windows live mail will crash when you create or reply to an e mail message
9253957 this was actually an inaccuracy on our end that has since been fixed
9253958 live mail will work just fine for ie8 beta 2 users
9253959 internet explorer 8 beta 2 is compatible with windows live mail
9253960 to make sure that internet explorer logs off hotmail click the hotmail sign in link after you log off hotmail
9253961 ie8 beta 2 displays a compatibility warning when certain versions of the skype add in are installed
9253962 when you disable this add in the main functionality of the skype product is unaffected
9253963 this was my new girlfriend and we havent broken up yet
9253964 it may take a couple of months it may take a year but im going to get it
9253965 is it luck no its the knowledge that im not going to give up
9253966 back in 1994 95 the total number of files on a hard drive with the system on it was around 48 000 if that leopard starts with 540 000 files before you even enter your name
9253967 back in 1994 when i started most things were corruption or electronic or slight mechanical problems
9253968 hardly anything had to go into a clean room in that year
9253969 some of the guys are better at firmware some of the guys are better at component repair and then theres my solid state guy who rocks
9253970 each guy may touch ten recoveries a day ive got seven guys in here 70 a day i can do 1 400 a month
9253971 in earlier years different symptoms were impossible but now weve resolved them what was once impossible is now an easy fix
9253972 i used to think platter swaps were impossible and now my guys do them routinely
9253973 these younger guys just say let me have at it
9253974 every drive that goes back after recovery goes with tips on how to backup your data and protect it from data loss
9253975 i dont think anyone will go into a store to buy it just for the youtube support but it will be a nice extra when customers are trying to decide between two models
9253976 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9253977 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9253978 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9253979 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them
9253980 regardless i do want to apologize for the downtime youve suffered through thus far
9253981 at the moment it seems relatively benign but there are dangers lurking
9253982 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9253983 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9253984 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9253985 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9253986 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9253987 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9253988 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9253989 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9253990 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
9253991 the mother of all storms we want 100 percent evacuation it have the potential to impact every area of this metropolitan this is worse than a betsy worse that a katrina you need to be scared and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now
9253992 may have been trying to shock jaded residents into taking prudent step
9253993 warnings were considerably more dramatic than the forecasts issued by the national hurricane center
9253994 this storm could be as bad as it gets we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9253995 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
9253996 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
9253997 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
9253998 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
9253999 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
9254000 we started with master slave replication on mysql for a very simple reason we know it well and we know that while mysql replication has many wonderful features like simple set up it also has many deficiencies that have persisted for a long time
9254001 the code is in the early stages but will mature very rapidly
9254002 we are looking forward to creating something that brings powerful replication within the reach of every database user
9254003 a potential incremental scale out offering for customers using low end databases and hardware that either cant afford or dont want to buy into the whole oracle rac architecture
9254004 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9254005 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9254006 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9254007 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9254008 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9254009 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9254010 the search committee and board of trustees felt that i had certainly learned to ask for money
9254011 why dont you guys just sit on a block of ice and tear up 20 dollar bills
9254012 thats always a difficult situation in the second half when youre up 50 0 at halftime you want your backups to move it but you dont want to be a bad guy and be throwing it all over the place and taking advantage of whats there
9254013 those are all tough decisions thats just the way it goes
9254014 its the first time out this year trying to kind of avenge a loss at the fiesta bowl last year so there was a lot of preparation put in to come out and play well
9254015 a nice trait of ours is that our players have always played until the end of the game they came back and played hard the whole game from that standpoint i was pleased
9254016 it was a great win for us but at the same time we cant beat our chests because it was just our first game
9254017 weve got a new opponent coming in the second week that weve got to get this game behind us
9254018 everything isnt always perfect or how you want it to be
9254019 five years ago you couldnt sell a black tv set but now it has taken over the market
9254020 if you make a wrong decision it can topple your company if you dont have the financial muscle
9254021 i personally think its too close to some residences and some commercial areas and they have a history of a spill
9254022 its pretty clear academic preparation is the single most important thing prior to college
9254023 they come to college and they think they can do that again i tell them you cant do it that way you will fail if you think youre going to study two hours a week and get as and bs in college
9254024 i dont think we could push it higher than three out of four without passing out a lot of cheap degrees
9254025 the old notion of survival of the fittest and well weed students out is not the prevailing notion in education anymore
9254026 that doesnt mean there arent individual faculty members out there who feel the gate keeping courses those first level courses should be used as a way of weeding out students who arent academically tough enough to cut it in their major
9254027 an old school attitude that is in fact dying out as we take increasing responsibility for the success of our students
9254028 youve got to get beyond algebra 2 in high school
9254029 you dont have a lot of juniors and seniors who go on probation
9254030 what that does is to cut out the vast majority of students who enter college every year and dont do it full time and often have dropped out and come back
9254031 if we allow negative momentum to start early the consequences will snowball
9254032 all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed
9254033 ratings below these levels are unacceptable and are being addressed through service improvements
9254034 the procurement is taking longer than we anticipated which we recognize disappoints many customers we are trying to get this done as soon as possible
9254035 our assessment is that there s a large neutral survivalist tendency in this area
9254036 there s a clear majority ready to do better for their tribe but they re really sort of checking to see which way the tide is going
9254037 one of the insurgency stated intentions is to prevent the construction
9254038 this should be able to help the villagers with their illnesses and give us a good io information operations campaign to say that we can help them
9254039 there are 24 villages within a 10 kilometer radius of shar e safa
9254040 fourteen of those villages had no water no wells nothing
9254041 of course this kind of help is very good for the people of shar e safa
9254042 and for this kind of help the people are very happy for the u s being here
9254043 in the last five months this market has been safe and in the last four months it s been full of people
9254044 they really decided that they didn t want any more bombs they didn t want any more shootings here they got tired of it
9254045 i think people now are aware that they can trust us and they can trust the national police
9254046 the main complaint we re hearing right now is about electricity
9254047 but if they feel comfortable complaining to us about that it means they aren t as worried about harassment from the police or security
9254048 the market is about half full now and if they can get 80 percent of these stores full by the time i leave next year i ll consider this a big success
9254049 the navy exchange was being proactive in the event that a decision was made to distribute water to our personnel who live off base
9254050 if the program does not work out it s no loss to the nex because they will sell the water anyway at the nex mini mart commissary etc
9254051 it would be inappropriate for the nex or nexcom to comment at this time
9254052 since the water in about one third of the off base homes we tested had bacteria exceedences leadership decided that bottled water would be a precautionary measure until the health assessment was completed
9254053 everything does seem more expensive especially since i don t have income right now
9254054 i m nervous about what kind of job i m going to be able to get
9254055 but i don t have a lot to worry about right now
9254056 our assessment is that there s a large neutral survivalist tendency in this area
9254057 there s a clear majority ready to do better for their tribe but they re really sort of checking to see which way the tide is going
9254058 one of the insurgency stated intentions is to prevent the construction
9254059 the importance is to be able to determine if the patient has been exposed to elements of toxic concern dr joseph centeno a u s army research scientist told cnn
9254060 the commander doesn t know if a soldier is in a simulator or on the next ridge line
9254061 this is the best use of live virtual constructs we ve seen in the army
9254062 his expertise and knowledge of current doctrine have ensured the division s readiness
9254063 right now there are 10 divisions in the army and nine of them are concentrating on counterinsurgency as they need to be
9254064 at some point operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom will end and the army will come back to conventional warfare training
9254065 this division does a great job with the resources that we have
9254066 i know a lot of customers view us as mail carriers
9254067 i fully believe you re going to see changes around usafe
9254068 we went out and demi was dancing youre sylvain well bet you think this post is irrefutable proof that christian bale and kermit the frog have followed identical career paths sure we were skeptical when dlisted raved
9254069 if you held me in the corner and said here you go this is like going through survival school again and if you dont tell me
9254070 the thing i liked was that i thought we jarred the ball loose
9254071 we came out in pregame and i thought we were the tightest football team id ever been around
9254072 that wouldnt have been smart as a coach but i tell you it was close it was really close
9254073 you just had a bunch of guys out there today that this is the very first snap that theyve ever had in a varsity college football game weve got to grow and develop as a team really rapidly
9254074 what you look at as a coach is is it too much maybe playing both ways is just too tough for him well see what happens down the road a little bit that way again initially where we want him is on the defensive side of the ball
9254075 i applied for 75 jobs but i only had three interviews
9254076 i find myself more judicious about eating out and buying groceries my dogs are still eating well but i am not contributing at all to my retirement right now
9254077 as measured by our purchasing power our quality of life has not kept up with the cost of living as a result our standard of living has and will continue to diminish we are falling further and further behind
9254078 eventually the cost of doing business here will drop low enough to make the area more attractive for employers who provide high way jobs
9254079 every time we get a new order the work eventually moves to china as the project matures
9254080 the myth is that we are losing jobs because of chinas low wage rates but when you compare our wages and productivity rates with chinese wages and productivity rates the end result is not very far apart
9254081 the reason we are losing jobs to china is manufactures there have an 80 percent cost advantages because of currency manipulation and the fact that they rebate all taxes paid by manufacturers as an incentive to come there
9254082 the key to manufacturing is research and development if you can control the product life cycle and process you will get a much bigger piece of the pie including the manufacturing part of the operation
9254083 we need the type of federal research effort through nasa that followed the soviet launch of sputnik the government will have to partner with the private sector so that we can own product development again
9254084 what is colorado springs going to look like in 2020 if this trend continues we have to be realistic in what we replace these jobs with that pay a living wage with full benefits the types of jobs the next generation will need and want
9254085 it is time to determine what will give us the greatest chance of success we cannot allow the community to continue in this trend of declining quality jobs

9254088 weve been used to 20 to 50 wireless users in an area with another 20 to 50 maybe 50 or 100 feet away
9254089 when we first put this wlan in three years ago there were few wireless clients
9254090 these scaling issues are becoming more and more apparent where lots of folks show up and you need to make things happen
9254091 what its really about is understanding the throughput performance of a particular data stream
9254092 when i speak on this topic i always emphasize that we the it professionals not the vendors are the ones who best understand the user and application scenarios well be dealing with in our deployments
9254093 the dhcp server is not aware that someone has disconnected
9254094 we might be able to do something between the central wlan controller and dhcp so were not holding addresses for people who are never coming back
9254095 you have to look at your application and ask what am i trying to serve here
9254096 that will dictate whether you have to make use of a unicast or multicast transport
9254097 support for multicasting by vendors is all over the map
9254098 it guarantees faster speeds but it doesnt prevent one bandwidth hog from taking most of that
9254099 id like to have a fair share mechanism in the wlan so that cant happen especially in high density areas

9254134 we doubt that confidence will continue to rise if the pace of layoffs in the economy is increasing
9254135 our forecast projects that most states will experience two consecutive quarters of declining real gross product
9254136 further large declines in homeowner equity will adversely affect household budgets and hence local spending and have cascading negative effects on the financial system
9254137 the extent of the contraction in jobs and income in finance remains uncertain with ramifications in new york of course but also at financial centers across the country
9254138 we expect another moderate decline in payroll employment as headcount reductions persist in the construction manufacturing and various service producing sectors
9254139 strength in the less cyclical industries such as health care and government should continue to partially balance out the weakness elsewhere
9254140 while they may provide less signal than usual initial and continuing claims have moved higher and other survey indicators also suggest that labor market conditions softened somewhat in august
9254141 the august ism purchasing managers index should improve slightly on the back of similar improvements in various regional indices
9254142 the question will be whether the improvement will be broad based across components
9254143 considering that vehicle sales are declining and automakers are reducing sales projections and workforce levels the pickup in activity in this sector is likely to be temporary
9254144 sales are presently the slowest since april of 1992 buckling under tight credit reduced household equity and heightened inflation consumer spending depends heavily on the labor market
9254145 dont get a tattoo your skin will sag and look grose
9254146 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9254147 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9254148 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9254149 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9254150 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9254151 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf
9254152 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9254153 id love to have a discussion with him but hey i understand either way
9254154 i know im young and new out here but i do feel im playing good golf and play with a lot of heart i understand either way
9254155 it would be an incredible possibility but if not still been a dream year for me
9254156 i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9254157 yesterday i hit about as good as i could hit it i chipped in once and had a 6 footer that was the longest putt made all day
9254158 today was pretty nice but didnt feel quite as good as it did yesterday just kept it in play and tried not to make any mistakes
9254159 you have to allow so much time to get to the tee you are kind of cold and stiff by the time you get there thats a tough tee shot
9254160 i managed to get that one in play get it on the green and get a par under my belt
9254161 i kept coming up short on no 13 i came up short there
9254162 i hit a nice 9 iron from 136 yards that spun back and had about a 40 footer i three putted missed about a 4 footer for my second putt
9254163 theres a little breeze out of the north so the front nine was playing shorter than the back more birdie opportunities on the front
9254164 you listen to guys comments monday after they win invariably 90 percent of the time they use the word patience somewhere in the interview they still hit bad shots they still miss putts nobodys perfect but their attitude is such that they remain patient
9254165 i think tiger embodies that perhaps the best when he says all i wanted to do is keep giving myself chances
9254166 and i try to tell myself that out there i struggle with it at times because im not the most patient person around
9254167 my long game comes and goes im 6 foot 7 so im not going to be a premier ball striker i have my days where ill strike it well and ill have my days when i dont
9254168 mentally that was always one of my strengths when i was playing well was that i could finish it off i could elevate my game a lot of times to a level better than i was
9254169 i havent been able to do that this year its been getting better ive had a lot of chances to have good tournaments i just have made dumb mistakes little things happen just not in the right mental frame
9254170 my wifes comment after that last round was that was the first time ive seen you since you came back that you look like you used to look i feel like im starting to get there mentally
9254171 my golf bag was pretty old so i threw my bag away and i mailed them home
9254172 i have peaks of playing really well here and there
9254173 when i was doing golf schools with jim flick we had a really tall crew we thought about maybe putting on schools for the tall players we thought about targeting the nba nfl that sort of thing first
9254174 we had four of us that were all 6 foot 4 or above that would have been really cool we just never really gotten around to it
9254175 ive been hitting the ball nice and today i came up and it just was strange
9254176 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine my back nine a couple eagles really boosted the round for a while there there was certainly a chance of 59
9254177 obviously ive been chasing my first victory for quite a while and its just one of those things that hasnt happened
9254178 ive won on other tours but its definitely different out here its tough to win i can only hope once i do get over that hurdle there will be more to come
9254179 but im still enjoying it out here and i dont see that i put my added pressure to go out and win
9254180 i feel like the best way to go about it is go out and play golf and if its going to happen its going to happen
9254181 he just putted well today he did really well on the back but on the front he just gave himself a lot of opportunitites and he made them
9254182 the guy just putted phenomenal the putts on the last two holes probably should have gone in on no 8 the ball hit a spike mark and that one for par on the ninth could very well have gone in too
9254183 at the start of the year i was fighting a lot of things i couldnt really feel my swing very well and like i said the last few weeks ive just stopped thinking about my golf swing just going out and looking at the target and swinging thats just i guess how i seem to play my best golf
9254184 i guess i keep coming into the fedexcup way out of the picture
9254185 i guess im just focusing a little bit more trying harder i didnt play a practice round this week i didnt really even come to the course but thats when i seem to play my best when i relax off the course but i come out here to be focused and really try hard
9254186 i got off to a good start and it just snowballed from there
9254187 but im certainly not disappointed ive still got 36 more holes to play and a lot of golf left disappointed about the 59 but still at the end of the day when i was out there it was still early in the second round of the tournament

9254192 ok she she uhm so we discussed the divorce we discussed uhm well much of the discussion goes it goes quite well for me shes willing to give me the company shes uh uhm uh i suggest to her tat she wont be able to still get the thousand dollars a month that it wasnt really important to me you know because she didnt do well at the deposition but uh uhm the main thaing that i cant get out of her is is for her to share legal custody this was the only thing that was important to me in that negotiation uhm and uh she uhm discussed the falsified ailment and and uhm and makes clear that uhm well its clear that she never unintelligible falsified ailment she didnt believe in it herself and that she had fun and she turns sideways and smiles when she mentions how prestigious the dentist was you know after she describes it and uhm conveys to me that theres going to be more of the munchausens by proxy disorder stuff and that i will be unable to do anything about it and uh this uh caused me to become enraged and uhm i killed her and i shouldnt have done that im very sorry i did it

9254201 dennis kaufman is a conman nothing more he has some sort of axe to grind with his stepdad which is why hes accusing him of being z the first clue that hes full of it is the fact that he tried to sell a piece of what he claimed was stines shirt to tom for 50 000 ive seen the e mail and kaufman has spent the last several years denying that fact it only goes to show that hes trying to make money on this but otherwise has no interest in the case the fact that he wanted to sell a phony piece of stines shirt instead of turning it over to the authorities speaks volumes the second clue is his baseless claim that his stepdad murdered his mother i have a copy of her death certificate and it shows that she died at the uc davis medical center of cardio respiratory arrest due to anoxic brain injury due to respiratory failure due to autoimmune cholangitis in other words she died of natural causes due to the rare disease she had true she was only 50 years old but people can die of natural causes at any age dennis kaufman is not to be taken seriously law enforcement obviously doesnt or they would have arrested jack tarrance for the zodiac murders years ago
9254202 it could be a knife he bbqd with or killed someone with
9254203 i developed some gruesome pictures and they are of people he murdered
9254204 eight years of dennis kaufmans life has been consumed with attempting to prove the only father hes known since he was five years old is none other than the zodiac killer
9254205 oh youve got handwritting and pictures no well take those instead
9254206 hey would you rather find bin laden or the zodiac killer

9254211 im proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me and i intend to carry their legacy as long as i can
9254212 i told em if you hold hands with anybody in the huddle youre out of this place and on your way do you understand that
9254213 i told them you guys got a pretty good squad here but youre missing something and ill tell you what it is
9254214 its the very first meeting and he had an attitude
9254215 i mean the first thing i was thinking was wait a minute wait a minute
9254216 the new england patriots are a hard nosed football team and thats what we want to be
9254217 i dont care what plays we draw up what kind of meals you eat if you dont whup that guy across from you we just cant win
9254218 so you guys havent been able to beat the raiders oh every now and then
9254219 let me tell you where im coming from im coming from the new england patriots and we kicked their were gonna knock them in the dirt i dont care if you have to get in fights with them or whatever
9254220 was dead serious we took on an edge to our team that brought out an incredible confidence that we had that was waiting there waiting to come out
9254221 a wild man very very emotional and he hated the raiders
9254222 generally the chairs were set up so they were facing the front and there was a podium there
9254223 this time the seats were turned facing the side wall and there was a platform that had the projector on it there was a reel of film and there couldnt have been that much film on the reel
9254224 red comes in with the entourage of assistant coaches and works his way up to where the projector was and the rest of the guys lean against the wall red really never said anything theres stunned silence and were thinking whats going on here who died this is different
9254225 i want to tell you what i like about the oakland raiders
9254226 i dont like their colors i dont like their stadium i dont like their fans i dont like a thing about them
9254227 we could have gotten on a greyhound with our own money and gone out and kicked them i think we probably were higher then than we were for the game
9254228 to get my team to know that hey when you play the oakland raiders you have to beat them at their style that doesnt mean dirty hitting but hitting all day long and 1 2 3 4 5 and as many as 11 if you can get them all in on a tackle
9254229 the raiders were this incredibly talented team and it really did seem like the referees gave them a lot of leeway
9254230 they just got away with stuff they had a couple of guys back there like jack tatum and george atkinson who did some things and there was some holding and it always seemed that the referees kind of looked the other way or just kind of had the attitude of theyre the champs
9254231 so i come around the corner and theres red hes just lighting into chewing out the referees hes saying you guys call this game straight and if you dont i will be in your face
9254232 i was up for that game once in a while you have to get their attention you know i guess that was my way of doing it
9254233 it was one of those trick things you put in your bag and never would i have thought theyd call it
9254234 it took jim turner forever to get in the end zone
9254235 they followed riley odoms they followed norris they followed randy gradishar they all went to our right i went to the left and thank god there was nobody near me i had scored so many times in high school i think i was the second leading scorer in the state of california my junior and senior year so the scoring didnt bother me it was the catching and running god bless norris he threw it right on the money
9254236 it was a big play and sometimes it aggravates me that i kicked 304 field goals in my career and thats all they want to talk about that play
9254237 has to be the greatest day in the history of the denver franchise
9254238 and now gentlemen if we can play like that and hold together were going to be fine

9254243 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9254244 after 19 months of traversing through every state except alaska
9254245 which now that i think about it were going to have to go there now
9254246 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9254247 obviously this is a very serious situation every indication is that this storm is bearing down on the louisiana coast and it is potentially a very powerful storm i think the main message that gov jindal mayor nagin mary landrieu and other officials wanted to communicate is for the public in those areas that are potentially in danger to take the evacuation seriously even if youve ridden out this storm before even if you think that it may pass over even if you think that you can wait until last minute this is going to be potentially very very serious and you know for your own safety and your familys safety people have to follow the instructions of the officials there to make sure that this evacuation is going smoothly
9254248 this could be worse it may not be worse but katrina wasnt the it was the worst storm ever hit it but its not the worst storm that could have hit new orleans and the back end of this storm if the east end of this storm which is the tough side ends up being the place that goes over over new orleans this could be this could be gigantic in terms of its consequences but those folks who rode out do not ride out again ride out of town get out of town do what the governor is suggesting what the mayor is suggesting what the senators are suggesting get out of town
9254249 want to wade into the white house decision making at this point
9254250 we want to make sure that we are monitoring the situation and that we can be useful
9254251 i demand an immediate apology from michael moore to the people of south louisiana for his offensive and inappropriate comments
9254252 people in louisiana regardless of political affiliation are making plans to leave to protect their families from this serious storm and the god i know would not share michael moores glee for our plight

9254267 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9254268 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9254269 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9254270 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent

9254279 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9254280 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9254281 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9254282 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9254283 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9254284 and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution
9254285 its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides

9254294 i thought he played pretty good in the first half i dont know when he hurt his thumb i dont think he said anything to me
9254295 i just want to set the tone and let the people know what i can do
9254296 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9254297 im very proud of that said nishikori who at 18 is the youngest man in the us open round of 16 since marat safin in 1998
9254298 i still cant believe it he said i was playing great and he was playing great too
9254299 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9254300 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win nadal said
9254301 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9254302 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too querrey said i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9254303 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there serena williams said
9254304 the springboks got into the game they built momentum and we dropped off it and thats what happens at this level
9254305 the springboks are world champions someone has to be bottom of the table it doesnt mean youre not a good side
9254306 weve already seen in this tournament how little it takes to go from being a victor and enjoying the experience to a loser and not enjoying the experience
9254307 i guess whats evident is how much it took us to lift the mandela silverware so weve achieved something and weve got the opportunity to go on and achieve more so well hang on to that
9254308 weve got the opportunity now to regroup and get back and focus on what is a fantastic opportunity in brisbane
9254309 they came up and threw it in my face it was like they were mad at me
9254310 we knew we had the speed on them but we didnt think our drives would go that quickly
9254311 our coaches did a great job preparing all week and we executed vernon caldwell played great at quarterback for us and our defense beat them at the point of attack and stopped their power game
9254312 i was just focused on giving my daddy a good birthday today
9254313 he flew all the way out here to ohio for the game so i wanted to make it worth it
9254314 we moved the ball in spurts but when you play a good team like that you have to score it was a good experience to play in this event and well get better
9254315 weve been working toward this since february when you know youre going to play in the dallas cowboys backyard theres motivation there its a huge disappointment but a huge learning tool too
9254316 weve been working toward this since february when you know youre going to play in the dallas cowboys backyard theres motivation there there are some kids that havent been there its huge disappointment but a huge learning tool too
9254317 if youre going to err err on the side of caution
9254318 the central school system office worked all day on this with us but in the end we just couldnt do it in the end it came down to travel and what happens if the storm comes and we get stuck in dallas there were players who didnt have parents coming to the game and they would be separated from their parents and what then
9254319 just trying to sort the information out and to make a decision from a standpoint of when he might be available to us as a football team so thats what we are trying to figure our right now
9254320 the key right now is we have a lot of people looking at the injury and trying to get us the best information possible on what they think whats the best scenario whats the worst scenario thats what we are sorting out right now
9254321 we went out there and tried to make big plays
9254322 we got a sack on the first play of the game and set the tone
9254323 in the first half turnovers and penalties hurt us but in the second half we came out ready to run the ball
9254324 thats who we did this for hes been here all this time and it feels good to get him his first win as a head coach
9254325 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9254326 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9254327 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9254328 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9254329 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9254330 and you know its great that its the u s open
9254331 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9254332 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9254333 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9254334 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9254335 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9254336 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9254337 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9254338 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9254339 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9254340 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59 he said
9254341 im going to have to do a little better weir said
9254342 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible streelman said
9254343 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9254344 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9254345 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9254346 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf clark said
9254347 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9254348 but no 8 was always going to be tough he said and that proved to be true
9254349 you have to remember that ahman hasnt played a lot
9254350 to all of a sudden go out there and start and think he is going to carry the ball 25 times this weekend i think would be a mistake we could very well play three guys in the game
9254351 myself chris taylor fullback vonta leach and steve slaton were all going to be backing each other up
9254352 so im not worried about not having enough energy because those guys when they go out there on that field ill be resting up and cheering them on and vice versa
9254353 a lot of veterans told me that is the reason some running backs dont play they cant protect
9254354 thats one of the things that i felt i could do the most improving on
9254355 you have to remember that ahman hasnt played a lot
9254356 to all of a sudden go out there and start and think he is going to carry the ball 25 times this weekend i think would be a mistake we could very well play three guys in the game
9254357 myself chris taylor fullback vonta leach and steve slaton were all going to be backing each other up
9254358 so im not worried about not having enough energy because them guys when they go out there on that field ill be resting up and cheering them on and vice versa
9254359 a lot of veterans told me that is the reason some running backs dont play they cant protect
9254360 thats one of the things that i felt i could do the most improving on
9254361 pittsburghs defensive coordinator dick lebeau is a guy whos a genius at what he does and when you watch film on their defense it looks like youre watching organized chaos
9254362 because before the ball is snapped it looks like theyre all lost they dont know where theyre going they look like dogs in the neighborhood then all of a sudden the ball snaps and theyre hitting their gaps hard fast so weve got to be ready for that
9254363 for a little town to have to have a parade that big was amazing
9254364 i thought there would be a few people but the parade was amazing and this tops it all
9254365 to be honest with you ive been surprised that ive been out for so long with the national team
9254366 i was sort of disappointed a couple of times that i didnt get called in recently but at the end of the day i cant do anything about it but keep playing ball and to the best of my ability with the dynamo so i can get looked at im definitely thankful about getting another call up
9254367 all ive heard is people congratulating me today and i was like what
9254368 i do think i need to win but it is feasible and it would be a wonderful way to make the team
9254369 ollys the favorite but ill see if i can make him sweat a little
9254370 i think youve got plenty out of me this week thank you very much
9254371 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9254372 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9254373 barry o amp squo farrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9254374 i just remember thinking this is so great said castroneves who partnered with julianne hough to win last years
9254375 at that point someone started grabbing my butt it was time to get out of there but i was so happy i guess one day im going to get into trouble doing things like that
9254376 im glad i can do this still show my appreciation have some fun
9254377 we employed a very risky strategy at sonoma to win the race so we are prepared for it again at belle isle castroneves said
9254378 you can bet helio castroneves will be taking every risk to win on sunday
9254379 i feel great and we have an even better car for detroit castroneves said
9254380 i know what we need to do push hard take some risks the pressure is on these guys ganassi we go for it
9254381 scott didnt have the superb car he had in other races castroneves said
9254382 roger made this race happen in motor city castroneves said
9254383 he did everything in his power to bring it here
9254384 it became clear to us that the amount of time we spent taking care of pennies wasnt valuable in the long run
9254385 they think its a really good idea especially since parliament has been discussing getting rid of the penny its something the country is kind of moving towards
9254386 its something the cafe management thought was really great so were trying it out
9254387 if it continues to go well youll probably see this in our other cafes too
9254388 at the end of the day our cash is rarely off by very much
9254389 but i think at the same time the amount of time its going to save everyone would be outstanding
9254390 i think weve triggered an irreversible shift towards abolishing the penny
9254391 but i dont blame the local retailer for losing patience and unilaterally taking action
9254392 i dont expect to deal with that in the near future
9254393 the reason there are so many is because the penny is not used
9254394 there are still some people here and there that want to keep the penny as a symbol of heritage and the past the government doesnt want to put these people against them
9254395 all the progress weve made other than public opinion would be lost if an election takes place
9254396 but it gives us an opportunity to make it an election issue
9254397 i suggest we hold a birthday party and a funeral simultaneously and not issue any 2009 pennies
9254398 i thought our defense came out really strong early and it was a good thing they did since our offense needed a little time to get used to the game
9254399 we were just a lot more comfortable in the second half
9254400 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9254401 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9254402 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9254403 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9254404 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9254405 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9254406 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9254407 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9254408 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9254409 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254410 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9254411 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9254412 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd
9254413 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9254414 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9254415 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9254416 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9254417 make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out to get on your roof with waters surrounding you
9254418 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9254419 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9254420 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9254421 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9254422 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9254423 i am georgiana i am not diana the film is not about diana
9254424 the idea that she was constantly being watched and was never alone and yet was so lonely is something i find very interesting im fascinated that you can make a period piece set 300 years ago and set in a society that yes has some similarities to today but was really very different from the one we live in and yet you can still completely sympathize with whats happening and understand what shes going through i think human emotions havent changed that much
9254425 its very difficult its something thats taken a lot of getting used to if i have got used to it it can make you feel incredibly trapped equally im incredibly lucky
9254426 im doing a job i really really love doing and i am fortunate enough to be able to help get films made that i think are worth it so thats obviously amazing but there are always going to be downsides
9254427 i think part of my job is to be able to observe people so i can portray them and when youre turned into the person who is observed its very difficult to kind of grow and present yourself as an actress so there are certain contradictions within all of it that make it quite tough
9254428 but i was never in competition with my family and theyve never been in competition with me
9254429 both my father and my mother have achieved wonderful things played amazing parts written incredible scripts they may not have had financially the successes ive had but i think each person particularly in this profession you have to count your own triumphs you cant compare them to anybody elses and theyve both had enormous triumphs in different ways
9254430 as far as womens clothing goes we havent ah banning the corset is a good thing but there is a similarity between six inch heels and the rest of it
9254431 but we however have an option to wear trousers and not wear six inch heels the way georgiana was held up as a sort of fashion icon and every minute detail of what she wore was picked apart and her appearance was picked apart and written about its astounding that thats something we havent moved away from in fashion itself
9254432 theres a certain point when the parts dry up im very lucky im making good money right now but its not going to be like that forever so i think you have to be quite sensible about it i own my own flat in london thats incredible house prices are ridiculous so im very lucky i dont think im extravagant
9254433 my mom and dad have always brought me up to look after myself i never wanted to be dependent upon anyone else i expected to have to find my own way and ive been incredibly lucky to be able to do that
9254434 but the film industry is like gambling you can have the best script and the best people but the film may still not work or you can have the worst people and the worst script and for some reason the film actually does work
9254435 you never know what the outcomes going to be so its very important that you do things youre interested in that are going to be fulfilling within themselves then whatever happens with the final product it doesnt devalue the experience that youve had so im looking for something i find really exciting and when i find it i shall do it
9254436 today it is very difficult to predict if a film will have a broader audience
9254437 their presence this year reflects as has just been demonstrated at the cannes festival that our cinema is returning to levels of excellence
9254438 for us what is really very refreshing is the fact that we in venice can present a wide spectrum of all the possible roads open to italian cinema we have filmmakers who are very diverse
9254439 because on screen they would become magnified almost unbearable to watch
9254440 south australians can be proud of the fact we have significantly less litter and higher recycling rates of drink containers than any other state
9254441 on clean up australia day drink containers made up less than 10 per cent of sas litter compared with 40 per cent nationally
9254442 this is because of our nation leading approach to recycling
9254443 weve established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe
9254444 as prime minister i told harper i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9254445 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9254446 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9254447 our view is there should only be one liberal candidate in the leaders debate
9254448 you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9254449 cant bring in a ringer to boost him during the debate
9254450 i like to think canadians notice when someone breaks their word in such spectacular fashion
9254451 something spooked him and he changed his mind its contemptible
9254452 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9254453 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9254454 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9254455 we went after the police and i was in the second row i was tear gassed
9254456 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9254457 typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9254458 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9254459 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shutdown of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9254460 several patients came to st anthonys emergency department from a site in east st louis illinois with an unknown chemical exposure
9254461 as a precaution for our patients visitors and employees access to the entire hospital campus initially was restricted
9254462 will remain closed until the nature and extent of the exposure is determined
9254463 fifteen employees and one patient had to be decontaminated as a precaution but we dont believe that anybody else has been harmed
9254464 tests carried out on friday do not detect radioactivity any more in either the air or the water
9254465 further tests will take place in the coming days to follow the situation closely
9254466 i hope thats a signal to finish closing this deal
9254467 our joint efforts are clearly visible in the transnational pipeline joining turkmenistan with china along the banks of the amu darya river where turkmen specialists have discovered a gigantic oil and gas field
9254468 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9254469 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9254470 its been said that i was treated like a prince but that is not how it was
9254471 here i had difficult moments as well which i overcame with work and sacrifice now im very optimistic because returning to milan is like returning home
9254472 when i was at chelsea what i missed most was the organization the preparation and the atmosphere of this club lots of little things that are nevertheless important
9254473 arsenal are a great team but milan are the greatest in the world
9254474 ive seen that players work more here in the italian championship than in the english championship
9254475 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9254476 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9254477 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9254478 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9254479 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9254480 if you call in the next 10 minutes you also get
9254481 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9254482 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9254483 you feel for anyone who goes down especially when it looks like a leg injury
9254484 first you think oh is it a knee then is it an ankle from what i gather other than getting medical people into it its a foot thing x rays are negative but absolutely your heart jumps
9254485 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9254486 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9254487 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9254488 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9254489 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9254490 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9254491 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254492 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9254493 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children
9254494 just seeing obama on stage i cried my eyelashes off
9254495 it changed my life i feel like im going to do better and work harder
9254496 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
9254497 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9254498 i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9254499 had not been able to come to a formal agreement with mr wainwright and his management concerning plans for the work
9254500 the models will have to shift significantly westward during the next 12 hours i believe for the greater houston area to receive evacuation orders
9254501 such talk needlessly frightens people who would be better off staying at home theres no real reason for a cypress resident who lives in a sturdy modern house to evacuate
9254502 so just to clarify based on your opinion experience there would be no certain tropical system condition size breadth of storm wind speed where it makes landfall or expected path that would urgently require someone in my area to consider evacuation
9254503 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9254504 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9254505 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9254506 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9254507 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9254508 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9254509 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9254510 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9254511 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9254512 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9254513 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9254514 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9254515 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9254516 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9254517 my wife says i would rather speak to you on the phone than for you to come back here and be killed
9254518 she says id rather you talk on the phone to your children than for them to have no father
9254519 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9254520 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd

9254525 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254526 its been a big upheaval beveridge said of the draw
9254527 it all comes down to the venues as well you cant get the venues
9254528 it was really really frustrating because obviously we didnt want to be on the road like that at all
9254529 im not going any more than knee deep in australian water said the 186cm low
9254530 im going to try to get this brand new team going low said
9254531 hes one of the most unselfish imports ive ever seen beveridge said
9254532 hes a very intelligent player to me he could be one of the better imports in the league
9254533 he came out and toured australia with washington last year he played against the australian boomers and had 35 points in a game against the kings he can play and hes tough as nails
9254534 i dont think im far away from the nba he said
9254535 obviously it wasnt my time this year but hopefully i can improve my game in australia
9254536 those tablets changed him and he started to treat me like a slave
9254537 he was a gentleman and a good man but then he started taking the tablets
9254538 after taking those tablets he told me it was very important for him to have sex three or four times a day
9254539 until april 2001 he was very correct to me there was no violence there was no pressure of any kind to do anything
9254540 he put his gun in my mouth and said one day i will kill you
9254541 this is your punishment for not completely satisfying me and this is what i will always do
9254542 it confirms that the law is there to help victims of this type of thing
9254543 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9254544 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9254545 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9254546 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9254547 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9254548 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9254549 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9254550 people are starting to rethink what a healthy landscape looks like its not the trugreen chemical lawn anymore its a landscape thats more multipurpose that combines beauty and utility
9254551 i would love it the front yard of the white house we could get back to our roots
9254552 but weve had several cases where we had to tell people to cut vegetable gardens back residents were complaining
9254553 early presidents were responsible for providing for their own households and feeding dignitaries
9254554 but in general the history of vegetable gardening at the white house got lost because its so ordinary
9254555 most people dont realize that the victory garden program is a world war i program
9254556 her victory garden was a visible symbol that the family was pitching in doing their bit and making a sacrifice
9254557 i was watching my mother in law take things from their garden into the kitchen and transform them magically through the wonder that is belgian cuisine into things that were very very memorable to me
9254558 i was realizing that the europeans were really onto something when it comes to food
9254559 to pretend they can be a functional part of a front yard ornamental landscape is a stretch
9254560 bashing lawns as useless and environmentally unsound is a tired old story
9254561 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9254562 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9254563 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9254564 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9254565 make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out to get on your roof with waters surrounding you
9254566 we earn income from the horses being part of carnival activities and from donations but ei stopped the horses leaving the property last year so they earned nothing and tourists were not allowed on the property we are on the brink
9254567 we have three of the old champs going to the caulfield cup four to the launch of the flemington carnival this week and for the cup parade and four going to perth
9254568 that revenue will help us get through until the end of the year but that will be it as far as the money goes
9254569 frankly unless we can get sponsorship or a couple of major benefactors the future of the whole project is in doubt
9254570 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed amp we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team
9254571 i would definately sic make sure i got caught and impaled
9254572 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9254573 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9254574 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9254575 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9254576 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9254577 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9254578 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9254579 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can take only a few weeks off work
9254580 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in child care at six weeks i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth
9254581 i was talking to someone in child care in queensland this year she said that were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9254582 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in child care should i be doing it
9254583 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people the high flyers they think now we need a baby we can dress up and make look perfect
9254584 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world the child just wants to be held it wants to have attention to be the centre of a universe
9254585 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9254586 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9254587 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9254588 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9254589 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9254590 so someone sitting in the united states you see the news and you cannot differentiate
9254591 we visit different countries we have an investment law we have the government web site and ads on arabic channels
9254592 the perception in american boardrooms is informed by the u s state department travel advisory by what is seen on tv
9254593 the kurdish government is trying a lot but some things are not in our hands
9254594 dumb when the 25 year old lost his head during a pre season game in his home town of wollongong
9254595 i dont know what to say it was total frustration prentice said
9254596 it was a bit of a brain explosion and obviously i regret it
9254597 its disappointing but i cant blame anyone but myself for what happened i just have to learn from it and move on
9254598 moved on from an assault conviction in february when he was fined 1150 for an altercation in a perth restaurant
9254599 he was very disappointed about the suspension and he had every right to be prentice said
9254600 he didnt speak to me directly after the game but during the week he had a chat to me and i had to cop it on the chin what he said
9254601 he said to try to keep level headed and to stay tuned in all the time be switched on mentally and dont let small things get to me and affect the next phase of play
9254602 its always nice to put one past your old club he said
9254603 if we can get the three points well sit on top of the table or at least on equal points and then i think well have a full squad for the first time
9254604 dumb amp squo amp squo when the 25 year old lost his head during a pre season game in his home town of wollongong
9254605 during yesterdays chat i asked you what the latest news meant for conroe huntsville
9254606 basically do you think this area has more or less risk now based on the latest tracks and news im not an expert but it looks like our area isnt out of the woods
9254607 they were all here and the lights went out said hooker matt hilder who wore jersey 14 in a tribute to buderus no one wore nine someone hit the lights and it was dark in here for about two minutes they were getting into us it was good
9254608 a couple of mates had some money on me as first tryscorer he said captain kurt gidley added two penalty goals and even with greg inglis intercept try the underdogs led 10 6 at halftime
9254609 we sent him a message the messages are easy said smith
9254610 cameron smith was pouring down on him he knew what was coming how he threaded it through and hit it so sweetly under pressure
9254611 they were pretty determined to send danny out on a winning note with the old boys day so there was plenty of emotion for their team said storm coach craig bellamy
9254612 right up there for me in terms of victories with playmaker jarrod mullen missing most of the match with an illness
9254613 we did it for beds we did it for ourselves first and foremost said gidley
9254614 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9254615 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9254616 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9254617 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9254618 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9254619 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9254620 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9254621 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9254622 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254623 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9254624 but full credit to the cowboys we had to defend a lot i think they had 60 per cent of the possession for most of the game and we didnt utilise ours
9254625 he had a tight hamstring from last weeks game henry said
9254626 we have got an eight day turnaround so we will work overtime on a couple of players toget them up for our last game
9254627 theres just no excuse in this day and age to be wearing fur
9254628 princess mary is looked up to by a lot of people in europe and australia and shes looked up to as a mother i hope people will send a message to her that this is wrong
9254629 isabella will have grown out of the coat in a few months but those animals will still be dead mr baker said
9254630 we have serious concerns about the way a lot of these animals are killed and we think anybody wearing fur sends the wrong message that its ok
9254631 public awareness of issues surrounding the fur trade is quite high these days and it would be hard to find many people who think its ok to wear fur in australia
9254632 its a unique piece its various colours of mink sewn together but turned inside out sales manager elsa adams said
9254633 its really warm and its very soft and its quite strong quality as well
9254634 in the nordic countries it is very very difficult not to have fur because we get very cold winters fur is very warm and you will find a lot in the stores
9254635 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9254636 he hasnt lost yet dell so we hope he does a mick crocker and we can keep winning dragons coach nathan brown said
9254637 hes definitely doing well the big fella our last three weeks were going as good as anybody else everybodys trying to catch melbourne i suppose
9254638 ive been watching a little bit of those dancing shows so i was just getting my confidence up he said
9254639 if memory serves me correctly i havent scored that many tries in a match since the broncos played against the dragons in a semi final in 2001
9254640 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9254641 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9254642 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9254643 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9254644 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9254645 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9254646 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9254647 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9254648 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9254649 shes right large amounts of research are coming in showing that particularly for children under two but also under three childcare is generally likely to be harmful to them
9254650 theres so many pressures these days on just being a good parent that having negative coverage on childcare like that is very frustrating for a lot of parents
9254651 over 65 per cent of families have both parents working and for a lot of people its not about choice its because they have to
9254652 they both have to be earning money to pay off the mortgage
9254653 i think it does amazing wonders for their social skills
9254654 i dont see anything thats gone terribly wrong putting them into child care
9254655 childcare is not a good place for babies and we support her in that but we know that many families have elected to put very young children and infants into childcare because of serious economic pressures and we need to face up to that
9254656 and large numbers of parents have been convinced that their children should be in childcare at least one day a week
9254657 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9254658 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9254659 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8471
9254660 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9254661 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9254662 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9254663 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9254664 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9254665 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254666 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9254667 i love him i cant say enough good things about him he will always have a piece of my heart
9254668 it was honest and pure and wonderful and i cherish him always
9254669 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9254670 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9254671 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9254672 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9254673 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9254674 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9254675 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9254676 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9254677 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9254678 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9254679 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9254680 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9254681 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9254682 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9254683 its not too far from where you live and you can see a world full of things
9254684 its a variety of things you can do within a driving distance
9254685 this championship brings together lesbian and gay football teams from across the world encourages more gay people to get involved in the sport and through the spending power of visiting teams and spectators benefits the london economy
9254686 it challenges the machismo and homophobia that is often associated with football in many parts of the world
9254687 gay footballers help break down stereotypes and prejudice they are ambassadors for gay inclusion and equality gay football enhances understanding and acceptance of gay and lesbian people
9254688 have a good look at what hes doing if the talented all rounder is to save his career
9254689 theyve done the right thing by sending him home waugh said
9254690 theres got to be consistency in the group and youve got to stand for something you cant have players doing that sort of stuff
9254691 hes got to have a good look at what hes doing for sure hes got to re assess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9254692 sport across the board guys are getting paid a lot more money youre definitely more accountable for your actions
9254693 obviously having ricky back at home ive spoken to him a lot especially over the last 24 hours
9254694 i havent spoken to andrew in detail so its very hard for me to defend him
9254695 the statement this morning mentioned that cricket australia was concerned about andrews well being fearon said
9254696 i dont think that sounds like a case of his contract being torn up its a decision thats been made by the senior player group theyre concerned about his well being thats my understanding
9254697 the concern is to work with andrew to ensure that we get him back in harness for the next 12 months a spokesman said
9254698 michaels clarke concern is that he is as fully committed to playing international cricket as he needs his players to be
9254699 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9254700 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9254701 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9254702 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9254703 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9254704 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9254705 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9254706 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9254707 politkovska a tait le nerf de la russie cest le r gime qui la tu e
9254708 i believe in our quality and i think we got our fans back with this performance
9254709 when we all play together like that and show our spirit we have a chance to win
9254710 it was very important to show that if we play like this we have a lot of chances to win something
9254711 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9254712 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9254713 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9254714 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9254715 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9254716 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9254717 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9254718 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9254719 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9254720 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9254721 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9254722 i would not be surprised if this integration process would be going even quicker
9254723 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9254724 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9254725 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases
9254726 escalate tensions in europe through speculation over non existent threats to other former soviet republics
9254727 we want the european union to be united and react to this situation adequately it is clear now that this is not only about georgia it is about europes security
9254728 we dont suggest a complete isolation of russia but on the other hand appeasement policy will be even more dangerous
9254729 ive got a lot of clicking and popping going in there right now
9254730 being a starter is more meaningful to the korean fans
9254731 i for one am now breathing a sigh of earned relief as it looks like we in houston and west of here have dodged yet another bullet
9254732 people forget that its the real rate of return the headline rate minus inflation that really matters
9254733 and with inflation at a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent it means that savings accounts have to pay a very high rate just to break even
9254734 i thought there was something wrong with me i didnt fit with the cheerleader set
9254735 through the indicator i learned that the way i am is ok
9254736 i was a type that a lot of other people were introverted that freed me to go through the world being who i was
9254737 i was the only woman in some of those lecture halls
9254738 one thing ive learned in life are the limits of control
9254739 the purpose of knowing your type is to give you a better feeling about who you are but the next step for us is to help people look at their imperfections to see accept and forgive their dark side instead of projecting it out on other people
9254740 my wife says i would rather speak to you on the phone than for you to come back here and be killed
9254741 she says id rather you talk on the phone to your children than for them to have no father
9254742 it is expected any person whose case has been finally determined and they have no grounds for remaining in australia should depart
9254743 im not going to chance it not with my grandchild
9254744 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9254745 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9254746 really theres been no movement in any direction i dont think anything is imminent
9254747 freerun is about risk and risk is all about calculating
9254748 you make a calculation with your body if you see a jump or a move that you feel you can do then you should do it even if you are scared if you are afraid and you dont make the move then you are letting fear beat you you have to overcome fear and be successful
9254749 people think we are daredevils who would go for everything or anything but we have fears like everyone else our fears keep us alive
9254750 discipline is so important we train on ground level again and again and again until its perfect and only then do we take things up high
9254751 our three routes to success are dedication determination and discipline and if you are lacking one of these elements then youre not going to get very far
9254752 i teach people how to crawl first because thats something we often forget as humans how to walk using our hands and feet together
9254753 we have a saying start low and start slow its very important because if you start big or start wild or start crazy then youll get hurt and youll be put of the game
9254754 i used to be one of the kids whod vandalise things and get into trouble with the police
9254755 if a guy is close to getting into baseball activities then its a no brainer you want to take him on the road with you and monitor that
9254756 the dodgers are an organization ive respected for many years
9254757 we will unleash the fires of hell if the zionist enemy continues its crimes
9254758 the zionist enemy will have neither peace nor security while it occupies our land
9254759 will not rest until we have liberated all of palestine
9254760 i know pitching coach dave righetti knows what hes doing a lot of times it differs from day to day one day 100 pitches may be too much and the next time 132 may be just enough
9254761 its just that he has a tendency to have a violent delivery
9254762 sometimes hell have a very high pitch count inning hes had some 30s and almost 40 pitch innings those are the innings that really take their toll
9254763 the criticism you cant do anything about theyre going to blame somebody i see guys hurt all over baseball its just that there was more scrutiny with me than just about anybody i look around and there are guys hurt everywhere young pitchers new pitchers new managers old managers plus volquez has never gone this far plus out of the minor leagues they never go over 100 sometimes its 80 to 100
9254764 that might be a tough matchup for nate his first game
9254765 were going to be crowded in the outfield but were going to have to find a way to get nate in there
9254766 i guess people like the song i hope thats what accounts for it
9254767 i think its a new sound for me something people arent necessarily used to hearing its one of those risky records it just happened to work in our favor
9254768 i cant be overly optimistic sept 30 is still on the way i cant count numbers until they actually hit the paper but im always optimistic when my albums are about to be released i have very high expectations of myself and very seldom do i meet them but its definitely off to a great start
9254769 i tell people in my organization do not ever come up to me and say
9254770 as soon as someone says you have to be on itunes theyre the no 1 retailer i dont have to because i remember being a kid when i heard a song that i liked i would jump on the bus ride to detroit get a 2 50 transfer and walk a mile to the hip hop store to buy the new eric b amp rakim record youre not going to stop people from obtaining what they want if its available at some level
9254771 we get so caught up in technology and ease of downloading a single theres nothing wrong with listening to a whole record from start to finish
9254772 i like branding opportunities when its something im into and im definitely into beer and cigars
9254773 you probably wont see me on the cover of a wheaties box or selling tide detergent because its irrelevant to me
9254774 those tablets changed him and he started to treat me like a slave
9254775 he was a gentleman and a good man but then he started taking the tablets
9254776 after taking those tablets he told me it was very important for him to have sex three or four times a day
9254777 until april he was very correct to me there was no violence there was no pressure of any kind to do anything
9254778 he put his gun in my mouth and said one day i will kill you
9254779 this is your punishment for not completely satisfying me and this is what i will always do
9254780 it confirms that the law is there to help victims of this type of treatment
9254781 she was forced to undergo and undertake humiliating sexual acts without her consent and in circumstances where she was threatened with dire consequences if she did not succumb to his demands
9254782 everything is getting worse there are more kidnappings and more murders
9254783 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9254784 there is now a 9 percent chance of hurricane force winds in galvston from gustav and 14 percent chance for port arthur
9254785 whats a well built house were renting an old wooden house built in the 30s in west u
9254786 but to block the escape of people closest to danger because someone to the nw of houston doesnt want to be without power because of a toddler
9254787 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9254788 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9254789 what they the pad are trying to do now is overthrow the government
9254790 they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this is the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9254791 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9254792 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people
9254793 i cant hold back because a lot of the things musically that mark would have said ive got to say them hines said
9254794 i relied a lot on his ears and now i have to say what has to be said
9254795 i dont really want to change who i am but if it needs tobe said then ill say it
9254796 you can only be the black mother teresa for so long dickson said
9254797 i put it down to the fact that shes very comfortable this year she knows that weve got her back and theres a lot of warmth on that judging panel
9254798 and she knows its in these kids interests for them to get the real deal for them to get the true story
9254799 no amount of you go girlfriend youve done a great job is going to keep these kids warm when theyre on the outside world
9254800 i can amp squo t hold back because a lot of the things musically that mark would have said i amp squo ve got to say them amp squo amp squo hines said
9254801 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9254802 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9254803 but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9254804 the banks are in the same position and could easily do the same but while they were very quick to hike their rates independently to the rba when funding costs were increasing earlier this year they are now just stalling waiting until an announcement by the rba
9254805 they have talked for months about how they must concentrate on their own cost of funds not the cash rate now is the time for them to back up their rhetoric with action
9254806 they are boosting their bottom line instead of passing those savings to onto their customers
9254807 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9254808 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9254809 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9254810 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9254811 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9254812 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9254813 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9254814 we are the last non bank lender standing and the banks cannot just keep widening their profit margins and charging what they like while wizard is on the scene offering honest good value mortgages
9254815 if the banks dont compete with us customers will switch away from the banks because the savings could be huge
9254816 there is evidence that the australian banking sector may be more profitable than those of other jurisdictions
9254817 over the six years to 2007 the returns on equity of australias largest banks were higher than those in comparable international sectors including the united states canada and the united kingdom
9254818 this top down ultimatum delivered today stands to directly breach undertakings the company made yesterday afternoon in the australian industrial relations commission not to lock out staff who return to work on monday
9254819 its a category 5 at this point and gaining speed
9254820 we want everybody we want 100 evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9254821 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9254822 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9254823 off the bat there was a lot of screaming that it was a home run
9254824 obviously i must be throwing beach balls out there its embarrassing when we go out and score that kind of runs and we cant get a win
9254825 im not a home run hitter for me its tough enough to get hits from both sides of the plate
9254826 to hit a ball out there and not make an out is nice too
9254827 this is one of the best things for the healing process
9254828 its awesome what these softball players are doing its a huge lift
9254829 they said theyre trying to get three or four other high school teams involved with the cause its like a chain reaction
9254830 its not about the government we just want the vets to know were here for them
9254831 people like barry zito reaching out to us it means a lot
9254832 wait you traded me for a frickin hamburger wheres the fries and milkshake at least
9254833 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9254834 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9254835 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9254836 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9254837 make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out to get on your roof with waters surrounding you
9254838 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9254839 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9254840 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9254841 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9254842 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9254843 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9254844 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9254845 it seems incredible especially if you think about where the economy is at
9254846 youd imagine people would be cutting back on the expensive handbags but clearly not
9254847 theres obviously a movement towards age defiance but i think women want to be prepared and ready to go from day to night
9254848 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9254849 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9254850 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8471
9254851 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9254852 andrew has nothing to say hes not doing any media interviews
9254853 we have focused on a duty of care for andrew and we are concerned about his mental welfare he had a long and demanding summer
9254854 if you dont fulfil those unfortunately you are not going to be on our squad you need to be committed 100 per cent
9254855 i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because he is a very important player and we certainly want him as a part of our squad
9254856 he caught some good barra and was going to take out some of the boys from the cricket team next week
9254857 hes got to reassess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9254858 large scale evacuation will continue till all the marooned people are rescued in the next three to four days
9254859 we will have to provide food and shelter to the survivors until october as they will not be able to return home
9254860 essential commodities including food are now being transported by boat
9254861 more army personnel and medical teams have been sent to the affected districts with tents rubber sheets medicines and water purification tablets
9254862 we have been stuck here for the past 10 days with no rescue team reaching here our food and water stocks have run out our mobiles phones are working but they too will fail any moment
9254863 we have absolutely nothing with us here we left everything behind
9254864 the secretary general was saddened to learn of the loss of life and damage to property in bihar due to flooding
9254865 large scale evacuation will continue till all the marooned people are rescued in the next three to four days
9254866 a forward is always going to be frustrated when hes got two or three guys on him but i think he hall responded really well roos said
9254867 the opposition seemed to be throwing themselves on the ground and rolling around every time he got near the ball
9254868 so its a little bit of play acting going on from opposition teams which is a little bit disappointing
9254869 a home final is a real bonus everyone was just trying to get back into form thinking we were going to head to melbourne or adelaide so its great to be able to play up here he added
9254870 we can take about five and a half feet 1 67m of water above sea level but we cant take the 9 to 12 feet 2 7m to 3 7m theyre talking about
9254871 im supposed to be leaving but i keep waiting just a little longer to see what the storm is going to do i know its a risk
9254872 im a native who was born here my parents were born here if i can i will return and will rebuild and it will be stressful and it will be a challenge but this is my home and i love it
9254873 president bush called to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government
9254874 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9254875 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9254876 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd
9254877 its very warm and inviting kids can come you can bring a date its just a lot of fun
9254878 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9254879 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9254880 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9254881 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9254882 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9254883 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9254884 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9254885 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9254886 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my
9254887 i still cant believe it i felt happy and more positive thats why i felt i could fight through
9254888 im not surprised im sure he will be a very good player
9254889 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9254890 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9254891 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9254892 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9254893 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9254894 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9254895 we always knew that was going to do well as a video sex sells obviously
9254896 something id really like to see and i wish i could i dont know what ever happened to it there was a racier cut they werent allowed to air if anybody out there has ever seen that or knows anybody that has it i would love to see it
9254897 change the world with one song one dance and one vision
9254898 ultimately we want peple to vote its not about me its about a message
9254899 i didnt think i was out of it but i knew it was going to be tough to come back because he was playing really really well
9254900 he was serving close to the lines and hitting the ball so hard and flat and very deep
9254901 the toughest part was when i got broken serving for the third set i felt like he hadnt had too many chances on my serve up until that point
9254902 but i played some great points in the tiebreak to turn it around
9254903 i dont think im hitting a lot of unforced errors i feel like im moving well and i feel fit
9254904 well i think when youre at a tournament like this for me there is a chance that i could win the tournament
9254905 so i say to myself you know im going to give it my best shot to try and win
9254906 thats my goal for the tournament to try to win it i dont think that if you set yourself a target of the third round and you reach it you can kind of feel like youve achieved what you came here to do
9254907 i think its better to set the bar high and maybe you dont reach it i might not necessarily win this tournament but if i go with the intention of doing it it might not come as such a surprise if i do go deep
9254908 im not taking any chances i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9254909 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9254910 if its close to us our levee system wasnt designed for that kind of storm theres a tremendous risk
9254911 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the
9254912 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9254913 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9254914 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9254915 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9254916 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9254917 tomorrows summit must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9254918 i will also be pressing european leaders to increase funding for a project to allow us to source energy from the caspian sea reducing our dependence on russia
9254919 our mission is to prevent anyone from claiming that dokdo is not korean territory
9254920 we are striving to offer scientific incontrovertible proof that dokdo is korean
9254921 when i look at dokdo i am filled with pride at the idea that i am working for the country
9254922 instead of being apologetic japan is becoming more and more brazen
9254923 the island is much bigger than we had expected its beautiful
9254924 its a strong symbol but i just wonder if koreans have to always be shown portraying dokdo as a fight to the death
9254925 how did such a film get into the competition for the golden lion
9254926 without suspense which ends up irritating the spectator trapped in a cerebral and weak willed farce
9254927 despite some refreshing and surreal touches of humour the tone seems uselessly gratuitous
9254928 he reported to the king on the current situation and he will return to bangkok today
9254929 i want to go home i have nothing to do with this situation one frustrated australian man said
9254930 we will not quit we will not go home until we win
9254931 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9254932 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9254933 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell arsene wenger the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9254934 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9254935 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9254936 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9254937 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9254938 japans decision is very disappointing the south korean government should take immediate actions against the move
9254939 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9254940 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9254941 its a risk but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9254942 however the newspaper reports published today regarding the release of learco chindamo are entirely inaccurate
9254943 tap water in the area is supplied by welsh waters mynydd llandegai water treatment works this works takes water from the machlyn bach and ffynnon lligwy reservoirs
9254944 the treatment works that supplies capel curig also uses ffynnon lligwy as a raw water source
9254945 an increase in the levels of cryptosporidium has been detected through our routine water quality sampling programme this has prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9254946 if you have gastroenteritis dont return to school or work until you have been symptom free for 48 hours
9254947 it is all coming to an end now courtney said
9254948 hopefully we will be able to make an announcement just before phillip island there are some exciting times ahead he added
9254949 it is all coming to an end now amp squo amp squo courtney said
9254950 hopefully we will be able to make an announcement just before phillip island
9254951 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9254952 there are faith schools that are 90 per cent or even 100 per cent funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise five per cent of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9254953 90 per cent of the population have been ruled out straight away
9254954 if they can actually recruit from 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of those available they will get a better calibre of teacher
9254955 we need schools which embrace the diversity in our communities not schools which divide pupils and staff by faith all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9254956 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9254957 as a rabbi i am committed to jewish values and to passing them on to my children but as a rabbi i also understand that no one gains if this is done in such a way that it damages good community relations as in separate religious schools
9254958 faith schools are a long established part of the state school system in england
9254959 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children
9254960 a vegetable garden in front of the white house is a great idea and im really interested in history
9254961 whatd be really neat is to change the garden every couple of years to do something that celebrates the american history of gardening and what the presidents in the house and their first ladies may have done
9254962 thousands and thousands of people wrote mrs roosevelt personally describing their gardening experience or asking for seeds or tools
9254963 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9254964 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9254965 when you dont want to be in a place you just dont want to be in a place he was here for eight years he got tired of being here
9254966 i got like 17 walks on the last road trip
9254967 manny is happy no more controversy between him and the team
9254968 when you dont want to be in a place you just dont want to be in a place he was here for eight years he got tired of being here
9254969 we were getting our butts kicked by anaheim and the yankees and everybody was pointing the finger at manny
9254970 i saw manny running 5 9 a lot of times
9254971 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9254972 its a deadlock so we keep on protesting we are determined
9254973 this is a see saw battle it goes back and forth and we dont know how it will end
9254974 that royal trump card may allow samak to hold his ground
9254975 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9254976 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9254977 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9254978 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9254979 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9254980 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9254981 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9254982 chamlong told us to clean up the mess left by police so that pads five supreme leaders can use the offices inside the building during the rally
9254983 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9254984 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd
9254985 i asked permission to make the calls i thought i was doing the right thing at all times if i had been in breach of security the commanding officer would have mentioned it to me
9254986 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9254987 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9254988 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9254989 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9254990 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9254991 it was a tough choice it was a close choice
9254992 and the rest as they say is internet retail history
9254993 when i started to break away from major labels and go out on my own the big thing the internet offered was a glorified mail order system it was better than what we had before it offered hope to people like me that they could get out from under the labels and start over on their own
9254994 i spend a lot of time on computers but im not a huge fan of what they provide
9254995 they have taken away from us in a way it has made available so much entertainment that people are constantly distracted myspace and facebook gave hope to everyone who ever owned a guitar and some kind of recording device their music is now available and fighting to get noticed along with everybody elses there are millions of singers and songwriters and bands and when there is too much choice my reaction is i dont know what to listen to so my choice is not to listen to anything
9254996 its a weird profession to have i might have to get another job if people dont pay to buy a record im not going to be able to pay to make a record my ego is not so huge that i have to put out records just to make records if it doesnt pay for itself you have to reconsider how youre doing things
9254997 im still living in the 80s in that respect i always loved records that had the gatefold sleeves and the more elaborate artwork i still love it though i dont know how much longer ill be able to afford it
9254998 i had heard the early beatles before from my older brother but i thought this was somebody different the sgt pepper band
9254999 as a little kid that kind of thing is awesome
9255000 you cant say anything bad about paul mccartney or john lennon but i have to say johns melodies werent always great and while mccartney is absolutely the standout musician in that group he probably shouldnt have been writing lyrics
9255001 tiger williams ive covered the super bowl nba finals and stanley cup finals ive had former bears lineman stan thomas act like he was going to squeeze my head like a zit ive interviewed roger clemens hank aaron and donald trump ive been cursed at by mike keenan ive watched denis savard go into the hockey hall of fame ive been yelled at by bill wirtz i talked sports with ben affleck at the world series of poker and i cry almost every time i see jim craig skate up the ice looking for his dad in the stands as the 1980 u
9255002 were the guys there was no way they couldnt make it
9255003 creature with the atom brain why is he acting so strange
9255004 tiger williams ive covered the super bowl nba finals and stanley cup finals ive had former bears lineman stan thomas act like he was going to squeeze my head like a zit ive interviewed roger clemens hank aaron and donald trump ive been cursed at by mike keenan ive watched denis savard go into the hockey hall of fame ive been yelled at by bill wirtz i talked sports with ben affleck at the world series of poker and i cry almost every time i see jim craig skate up the ice looking for his dad in the stands as the 1980 u
9255005 tiger williams ive covered the super bowl nba finals and stanley cup finals ive had former bears lineman stan thomas act like he was going to squeeze my head like a zit ive interviewed roger clemens hank aaron and donald trump ive been cursed at by mike keenan ive watched denis savard go into the hockey hall of fame ive been yelled at by bill wirtz i talked sports with ben affleck at the world series of poker and i cry almost every time i see jim craig skate up the ice looking for his dad in the stands as the 1980 u
9255006 i think one of the disadvantages is if you have players right in the middle of other sports
9255007 several of my guys played baseball and have been swinging a bat instead of a club all season
9255008 its always best to go into sectionals at the top of your game
9255009 when sectional time comes were playing against monroe county teams that have been playing all spring it definitely gives them an advantage
9255010 most importantly weather conditions are superior in the fall over the spring i believe a person that is talented enough to make sectionals isnt going to need a spring season to prepare themselves for competition
9255011 it is very difficult for golfers in the spring to impress college coaches with their scores because the weather is so bad at the beginning of the season
9255012 during the fall theyve had all summer to prepare with no school to worry about
9255013 kids are out there honing their games in a better setting during the summer leading into the fall
9255014 its the best time of year when trying to prepare for the season there is no question that i would vote for a fall season i would love to see unity between all of the leagues throughout section 5 i think the entire community playing together would make us stronger in the unity of golf not just in section 5 but statewide
9255015 if there was ever a vote i would vote to stay put
9255016 i am pleased that we did not give up we just need to clean a few things up
9255017 sarah the last of the andres controlled the midfield for us
9255018 it was good to get this win after our loss to north rose friday
9255019 our defense led by our sweeper ally hoover was excellent also
9255020 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9255021 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9255022 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9255023 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9255024 he tormented me humiliated me hurt me physically scarred me emotionally and has placed a feeling of fear and mistrust in me that i have never been able to get past despite giving it a good effort
9255025 my fear is that he does have a temper which sometimes leads to violence and saying awful things and that it could flare up again when provoked i do worry if he is alone with them and one of the children upsets him that without someone to step in if he gets into a fit of rage that one of the children could get hurt based on his past behaviour
9255026 from the ages of about 10 to 21 my dad frequently would hit me pin me up against a wall slap me and hold either my arms or my face with extreme force frequently causing bruises
9255027 sometimes he would attack me under the influence of alcohol and sometimes he was totally sober
9255028 one night i arrived home from a party with my friend an hour after the curfew imposed on her
9255029 we walked around the corner to find my dad standing in the dark with a gun pointed at us and we were terrified
9255030 he was pointing the gun at us as his way of teaching us a lesson about punctuality
9255031 in 1992 when i was about 18 i sometimes forgot to flush the toilet out of laziness in my own private bathroom one time he went into the bathroom and saw that my toilet was not flushed and he pulled me out of a chair in the living room dragged me into the bathroom lifted the toilet seat up and pushed my face inside of the toilet bowl into my own urine to teach me a lesson about flushing toilets
9255032 we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9255033 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal
9255034 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9255035 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9255036 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9255037 the wind here is terrible this is looking very bad

9255039 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own

9255041 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9255042 make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out to get on your roof with waters surrounding you
9255043 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 11pm sunday aest on the west bank
9255044 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9255045 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9255046 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9255047 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9255048 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9255049 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9255050 id 8796869 300 pollheight movie path last two arguments are width and height
9255051 good matchups but in the end the experience of the dream team would win out and easier than you would expect
9255052 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
9255053 to put it simply we have been cheated because a country really fulfilling its obligations should not have to wait so long to join the world trade organisation
9255054 we are not going to change our manner of negotiating
9255055 some of our partners might like to freeze the process but we want to carry on
9255056 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
9255057 unless we see progress on that issue we cannot sign off on russias application for the wto
9255058 im not able to do the number of laps i like doing
9255059 everything was going quite well in the morning but i struggled a little bit in the afternoon session
9255060 the bike i had the quickest time on this morning didnt work in the afternoon
9255061 this weather is a lot better for going to the beach than to the race track
9255062 but its better like this than at other races where we always have a lot of rain
9255063 i did a good job in qualifying second position is good for tomorrow i had a problem in the second sector in some corners i wasnt fast enough
9255064 but i have done some good work on the set up and hope tomorrow i hope ill be faster

9255073 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of roman pavlyuchenko to the club
9255074 we must act urgently to improve our childrens performance in maths and encourage those with aptitude to go on to study it
9255075 literacy and numeracy in the primary years are crucially important to ensuring all students participate in education and make a positive transition to work and learning in adult life
9255076 students who do not achieve the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are least likely to stay on through secondary school or to end up in further study and employment
9255077 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9255078 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd
9255079 weve put a seven million pounds bid on the table to manchester united
9255080 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9255081 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9255082 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9255083 i met mike mccormick a couple of times and he said it would be nice to pass the torch
9255084 i said it would be great to take it from him
9255085 i told him ive been carrying this torch for 41 years and would be pleased to pass it on to him
9255086 he said he had a long way to go and i told him to keep doing what hes doing
9255087 i do like his chances hes been pretty dominating in every game and i love how he challenges hitters he might be the only one in the league without a streak of poor performances hes an incredible young man so poised for his age and his upbeat and relaxed attitude is a real positive
9255088 strikeouts and era are in your control wins and reaching the playoffs are not
9255089 for timmy to be a strong candidate hes got to win 18 or 19 but itll be tough if webb keeps winning
9255090 the thing with timmy he just wants to go pitch he enjoys pitching everything else is a bonus
9255091 its great to hear a cy young winner say ive got a chance
9255092 its a compliment to hear from him i could be one of those guys but im not thinking about winning a cy young award today tomorrow or the next day
9255093 i am very pleased with our effort and organization this early in the season
9255094 we had 12 shots in the first and a total of 20 for the game both teams played hard we just couldnt finish
9255095 im very very pleased with the passion and speed that our players played with
9255096 its like going back to the days in college where im trying to make the best of all the opportunities
9255097 i had a lot of them out there and im trying to make the best of them we are all out there competing for a job were playing with each other trying to get a win and at the same time were all out there fighting for a spot on this team and thats all i was trying to do was go out there and fight
9255098 when steve got his hands on the ball he caught the ball
9255099 some of them were what we would call routine catches but some of them i thought he plucked the ball off to the side close to the ground he showed sure hands and he showed some run after the catch too
9255100 he really has a knack a feel for the game you can throw the ball to him in certain positions and he can make nice catches i have really been impressed with steve
9255101 i wanted to play well for them i wanted to make some moves
9255102 i didnt get to see them out there but i know they were out there it was fun for me knowing that i was playing in front of them
9255103 i think buffalo is like lexington hopefully i am here to stay and we can make some things happen for the future
9255104 although we are strong at the top of our ladder our teams success depends on how well our doubles teams perform this year
9255105 the rest of the team is very close in ability and we need to find the winning combination at third singles and both doubles
9255106 canandaigua mynderse whitman and hac are some of the top programs
9255107 newark has been competitive the last few years and there are usually other teams that will surprise you pal mac should be in the hunt
9255108 we have quite a few girls who are new to the program this year
9255109 we are a young team but we have started out well defeating both penn yan and lyons in our first two games
9255110 we have a very young team with all of them first year players except for one
9255111 our goal is to have fun and improve our skills as the year progresses
9255112 this is a great group of girls who are very talented
9255113 filling the shoes of former coach jen oravec will be difficult but we are doing our best to carry on the strong whitman tennis tradition
9255114 we barely lost the league championship to whitman in the league championship match and we lost the cc sectional championship to east rochester
9255115 we have five starters back and are excited by the addition of freshman megan allen who will fit right into the singles line up the challenges will be to take clutch singles points and find a replacement at second doubles
9255116 our strength will be in our singles matches while our doubles matches will be a learning and growing experience
9255117 they have the basic tools which need to be improved on our goal is to learn from every match and enjoy tennis
9255118 this will be a challenging year for our team which is very young and inexperienced
9255119 we have a positive attitude and look forward to making progress this year
9255120 come october 1 rogers will have new plans in place a 25 plan will provide 500mb of data downloads for 25
9255121 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9255122 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9255123 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9255124 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9255125 during the entire offseason we had been in conversations with her agent about abrosimova coming back
9255126 to go with a new team it was not an easy decision
9255127 minnesota was the only u s team i had played for in europe every two three years id play for a different team
9255128 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
9255129 and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
9255130 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
9255131 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in
9255132 if youre turned on by this then we didnt do our job very well
9255133 the arctic is a vast ocean and to find nine bears swimming in one area is extremely worrying because it means that dozens more are probably in the same predicament
9255134 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
9255135 im not taking any chances i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9255136 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9255137 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9255138 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9255139 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8471
9255140 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9255141 they are trying to shift blame from themselves to the striped bass for the collapse of salmon and delta smelt when it is in fact massive exports of fresh water from the california delta that have resulted in the dramatic fish declines
9255142 the fire danger in the forest is higher than it was when the 16 000 acre power and 8 000 acre freds fires started in 2004 its higher than 2001 when the 16 000 acre star fire started and its higher than 1992 when the 24 500 acre cleveland fire started
9255143 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9255144 the olympics is one of the more conservative international competitions
9255145 its a struggle sometimes to come up with new ideas
9255146 sometimes its a revelation sometimes its just work work work
9255147 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did
9255148 oh i think im definitely at my best now i think i understand the game more
9255149 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9255150 you just kind of put your foot down a little and show them that youre really out there to win and you know thats big
9255151 i kind of thought he was about ready to break through and he looks to me like he might be getting the confidence
9255152 you win three rounds of the u s open and you start getting the confidence you can beat these guys
9255153 is 10 times better my transition game coming to the net and being aggressive is better than it used to be
9255154 she was kind very kind i should have been as nice as she was
9255155 anyone could walk in and sit down at her dining room table everyone always left feeling better she had that knack
9255156 a lot of really great friends came out of that job
9255157 but at that point the pastor and others would come here to see her
9255158 she loved to go dancing with my dad especially at the senior center
9255159 she actually joined when she was still in her 20s both her and my aunt
9255160 she was active for over 30 years in it cooking for funerals and weddings and parties taking care of the firemen and doing fundraising
9255161 my mother loved playing the card game 500 you have to be a good strategist to play that game she was good at it
9255162 all the people of the world have a vital need for liberty
9255163 i never knew a man who wished to be himself a slave consider if you know any good thing that no man desires for himself
9255164 the role of the brass band during the civil war
9255165 i looked at the tragedy and what i had in my mind i wanted to put it on paper
9255166 i wanted it to make sense i wanted people to look at it and understand i dont do abstract
9255167 i think it turned out better than what i had to begin with
9255168 even if i dont sell a lot of prints if the families of those victims who went through a lot see my painting and believe that the victims are in gods hands now that theyre safe thats good enough for me
9255169 this is the first year where we are being much more proactive
9255170 although science is important we have not emphasized science in the primary grades
9255171 i looked at the tragedy and what i had in my mind i wanted to put it on paper
9255172 i wanted it to make sense i wanted people to look at it and understand i dont do abstract
9255173 i think it turned out better than what i had to begin with
9255174 even if i dont sell a lot of prints if the families of those victims who went through a lot see my painting and believe that the victims are in gods hands now that theyre safe thats good enough for me
9255175 all the people of the world have a vital need for liberty
9255176 i never knew a man who wished to be himself a slave consider if you know any good thing that no man desires for himself
9255177 the role of the brass band during the civil war
9255178 i have spoken with the police and it is believed that these incidents are adolescent in nature and that the vandals have mostly targeted vehicles that are unlocked
9255179 orchard park is not being hit any more than some other areas
9255180 but if people can keep their cars locked and off the streets if at all possible it will help
9255181 i guess you could say i was drafted into the army band of the 19th century
9255182 during battle once soldiers were injured the band would be given the order to stack their instruments and help with medical care
9255183 it was the only time in america history that a band would have been used in that sense they werent equipped to do fighting so they helped care for the wounded
9255184 they were ordered to not play songs reminiscent of home
9255185 those songs got the troops too homesick and some soldiers left and went home
9255186 the band director looked at me and said i need a tuba player and youre that guy
9255187 i have always loved music and loved performing i guess im a ham my wife says its because i have a big ego
9255188 but music is an aesthetic part of life you can escape the everyday part of life with music you can go somewhere magical
9255189 id give this position 110 percent because thats what it deserves
9255190 she was kind very kind i should have been as nice as she was
9255191 anyone could walk in and sit down at her dining room table everyone always left feeling better she had that knack
9255192 a lot of really great friends came out of that job
9255193 but at that point the pastor and others would come here to see her
9255194 she loved to go dancing with my dad especially at the senior center
9255195 she actually joined when she was still in her 20s both her and my aunt
9255196 she was active for over 30 years in it cooking for funerals and weddings and parties taking care of the firemen and doing fundraising
9255197 my mother loved playing the card game 500 you have to be a good strategist to play that game she was good at it
9255198 thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
9255199 i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made id do it again
9255200 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me hes raced me that way and thats the reason it went down like that in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and pile drove me
9255201 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9255202 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9255203 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9255204 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9255205 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9255206 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9255207 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9255208 i would not be surprised if this integration process would be going even quicker
9255209 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9255210 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9255211 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9255212 this is the first year where we are being much more proactive
9255213 although science is important we have not emphasized science in the primary grades
9255214 i personally think its too close to some residences and some commercial areas and they have a history of a spill
9255215 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9255216 we believe we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9255217 i have spoken with the police and it is believed that these incidents are adolescent in nature and that the vandals have mostly targeted vehicles that are unlocked
9255218 orchard park is not being hit any more than some other areas
9255219 but if people can keep their cars locked and off the streets if at all possible it will help
9255220 i guess you could say i was drafted into the army band of the 19th century
9255221 during battle once soldiers were injured the band would be given the order to stack their instruments and help with medical care
9255222 it was the only time in america history that a band would have been used in that sense they werent equipped to do fighting so they helped care for the wounded
9255223 they were ordered to not play songs reminiscent of home
9255224 those songs got the troops too homesick and some soldiers left and went home
9255225 the band director looked at me and said i need a tuba player and youre that guy
9255226 i have always loved music and loved performing i guess im a ham my wife says its because i have a big ego
9255227 but music is an aesthetic part of life you can escape the everyday part of life with music you can go somewhere magical
9255228 politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests people expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
9255229 she was kind very kind i should have been as nice as she was
9255230 anyone could walk in and sit down at her dining room table everyone always left feeling better she had that knack
9255231 a lot of really great friends came out of that job
9255232 but at that point the pastor and others would come here to see her
9255233 she loved to go dancing with my dad especially at the senior center
9255234 she actually joined when she was still in her 20s both her and my aunt
9255235 she was active for over 30 years in it cooking for funerals and weddings and parties taking care of the firemen and doing fundraising
9255236 my mother loved playing the card game 500 you have to be a good strategist to play that game she was good at it
9255237 as i tried to say way back when nobody believed me if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football
9255238 thats the only thing i know to do im not that smart
9255239 he very well may have been 31 of 33 with no picks
9255240 he proved today hes as good passing as he is running
9255241 if hes going to do that im going to get him the ball
9255242 coming out of the huddle pat told me he was coming to me hed seen something in the coverage
9255243 we were more of a bubble screen team than downfield he always had this in him
9255244 i think its going to back them up a little bit
9255245 they have to figure out a way to get off the field
9255246 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9255247 we see a larger percentage of gen yers or millennials or whatever tag we want to use have a closer relationship to their parents and feel more comfortable relying on parental support
9255248 we see that as a good thing that college grads are willing to go to their parents for support but we encourage students to stand on their own it seems the reliance can be too much and spill over on their ability to do the job
9255249 emerging adulthood the winding road from the late teens through the twenties
9255250 people jump to the conclusion that they are lazy and irresponsible and pampered and self indulgent
9255251 it is not true think about the ones you know are they lazy do they stand around in their underwear watching tv no they are out working their bottoms off trying to make money in these crummy jobs available to them in their 20s
9255252 we joke about the movie grandmas boy hanging out all the time sleeping on the couch
9255253 i can put 600 toward school loans instead of rent
9255254 rather than living for right now i am thinking about a house and retirement i can put up with this for a few years
9255255 the ones who give me flak are the ones spending money like idiots
9255256 they are also the same ones who complain about not having money
9255257 if children regret coming home it is not because of the stigma they like their parents and their parents like them but they want to make their own decisions without parental commentary parents arent that crazy about it either they like not knowing if they dont have any idea what time their kids come home or who they are with ignorance is bliss
9255258 i could never do that to my son as long as he is not causing any problems
9255259 i am not going anywhere until i am at least 30
9255260 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9255261 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9255262 said holtz who has led the pirates to consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1999 2000
9255263 theyre working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9255264 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9255265 unless you study the game you dont understand the implications of a win like that
9255266 shes exactly exactly what you and i need shes exactly what this country needs
9255267 to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first the country second
9255268 politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
9255269 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and serve the common good
9255270 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america into energy independence
9255271 refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political cost as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as commander in chief
9255272 we tease him a little bit call him vanilla ice sometimes
9255273 he will start to groove a little bit when the music comes on
9255274 you need to manage the game it is not incumbent on you going out there and trying to win it late in the game yeah you might have to thats ok youre ready to do that
9255275 kids grow up dreaming about these opportunities i hope he enjoys it
9255276 after workouts one morning he said lets go get a breakfast burrito
9255277 i didnt want to go all the way to jose bs he said no there is a place on campus northern lights theyre great trust me
9255278 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9255279 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9255280 requested that the priest return to the archdiocese to assist
9255281 mr abbott has been retained to conduct an inquiry into the process and procedures regarding this matter
9255282 we will place no limits on the extent of the inquiry or where mr abbott wants to go with this to address this issue in the interests of due process the archdiocese of adelaide cannot comment further
9255283 the allegations you make against fr fleming are of a very serious nature they should be investigated by the police and i would encourage you strongly to pursue your complaint with them
9255284 i was so angry that this man who had abused his power over me and had such a huge impact on my life an immediate impact had been put in a position of power again over young people
9255285 i cannot imagine how a person who has questions about their integrity can be put into such a position
9255286 i believe the catholic church must have been in contact with him because he rang me distressed about it and asked me to tell the archbishop that there was no penetration
9255287 it appeared really important to john that i advised the archbishop that we did not have intercourse i did tell the archbishop the exact relationship i had with john which involved no penetration but i didnt think it mitigated anything i recall the archbishop asking me whether he should ordain john i told him that it wasnt up to me to make that decision
9255288 the proper course is for these allegations to be investigated by the police or the church in the ordinary way
9255289 this is not the appropriate forum for him to come out with any response to the allegations
9255290 the appropriate forum is the courts or the ecclesiastical disciplinary tribunal mechanism
9255291 as archbishop of sydney cardinal pell has no jurisdiction over other dioceses or priests belonging to them
9255292 when allegations are received about priests in other dioceses complainants are encouraged to go to the police or the professional standards office in the relevant state
9255293 a copy of the complaint is also provided to the appropriate professional standards office to follow up responsibility for the selection and appointment of staff at campion college is a matter for the college which is a private institution not an official church agency and outside the sydney archdiocese
9255294 i take him as being probably the best driver on the circuit you never know what he can come up with during a race or what him and crew chief chad knaus can come up with in their cars to make it fast
9255295 we talked about it this week my trainer and i we were kind of going over the guys that were really going to be tough and it goes without saying jimmie johnson has proven that he can do it when it matters i think thats one of the guys youre going to have to beat youre going to have to beat jimmie to be the champion
9255296 we looked at the big tracks and know thats where weve been behind and weve been working hard to catch up
9255297 i think were there i really do you would always like to be ahead and thats why were still testing and doing all we can we should be a factor in this thing
9255298 thats the thing about the new format with the chase is all it takes is two bad races and all of the sudden youre chasing
9255299 those guys seem to have the chemistry they seem to have the momentum and they have their cars and the talent to really pull it off
9255300 those are definitely the guys to beat and ill be surprised if one of them dont win it
9255301 that team theyre dangerous because they can turn things around theyre a two time champ and theyve got a lot of confidence even though those guys theyve been getting beat by the 99 edwards and the 18 busch i dont think they ever count themselves out
9255302 i just know how dangerous hendrick motorsports is in general we just always are working to find whatever deficit we have or how we stay on top and you can never count them out
9255303 it really puts a lot of pressure on those guys when it all evens out and they have to pick it right back up again
9255304 we went through that last year and pretty much prevailed the best teams and cars going into it were me and jimmie
9255305 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9255306 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9255307 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9255308 i was talking to someone in childcare in queensland earlier this year
9255309 its actually child abuse its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9255310 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9255311 babies have very much higher levels of stress in childcare
9255312 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people the high flyers they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9255313 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9255314 the trappings of the cute dresses the adorable little boys clothes the toys the beautiful nursery all of those things the child doesnt know
9255315 the child just wants to be held it wants to have attention to be the centre of a universe for a few minutes of a day at least
9255316 if parents had a choice they wouldnt go back to work with their children so young
9255317 most mothers return to work because they are not in a financially viable position to stay at home maybe we need to be looking at a national maternity leave scheme
9255318 we havent had to have babies since the 60s when people could prevent themselves from having babies quite easily without having abortions
9255319 babies are difficult they are hard work the joy that children bring is sensational just brilliant but five kids in a family thats hard on some of the kids because not everybody can have the same amount of attention
9255320 to know how it can happen in our society is astonishing
9255321 those tablets changed him and he started to treat me like a slave
9255322 he was a gentleman and a good man but then he started taking the tablets
9255323 after taking those tablets he told me it was very important for him to have sex three or four times a day
9255324 until april he was very correct to me there was no violence there was no pressure of any kind to do anything
9255325 he put his gun in my mouth and said one day i will kill you
9255326 this is your punishment for not completely satisfying me and this is what i will always do
9255327 it confirms that the law is there to help victims of this type of treatment
9255328 its good to have a rivalry like that thats big in any sport
9255329 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9255330 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9255331 and you know its great that its the u s open
9255332 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9255333 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9255334 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9255335 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9255336 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9255337 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9255338 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9255339 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9255340 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9255341 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9255342 i have withdrawn my papers in line with the partys decision that asif ali zardari will contest as the presidential candidate
9255343 dictators can go there us fascists murderers can go there but the democratically elected chief minister of a federal state of india cannot go there nobody is dying to go to america no one needs a certificate from america
9255344 should america bow down to this kind of vilification campaign by a group of people whose agenda is anti bjp throughout
9255345 even 10 years after launching the dena credit card we have not been able to make much dent in the market hence we decided to go ahead with the sbi
9255346 our talks are in advanced stage sbi will handle all the back office functions and other process it will be mostly on revenue sharing basis
9255347 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work on saturday
9255348 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9255349 we believe we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9255350 we have contributed to the infrastructure in peters township for many years
9255351 the bulk of information being sought is unprecedented and too broad for us to commit weeks worth of work to gathering and verifying
9255352 we have some issues and we are addressing those issues
9255353 were not afraid to look at ourselves warts and all
9255354 we will spend 70 million dollar in setting up another plant in rudrapur and a r amp d centre in gurgoan in the next one year
9255355 we have the necessary approvals from the foreign investment promotion board for our investments
9255356 its part of a round of next steps in our park improvement plan
9255357 theyve been using them quite a bit and theyve been damaging the trails making it harder for walkers and runners to use them
9255358 weve invested a lot of money in those areas recently and they are getting damaged from people parking there
9255359 maintenance and repair of the kosi river embankment is the responsibility of india as per the agreement signed by the two countries there have been some shortcomings in the maintenance of the kosi embankment
9255360 it providing compensation is understood as both countries are bound by the treaty
9255361 we expect india to help us in the rehabilitation of the flood affected people in nepal
9255362 i do not have any peace formula and talks are going on between us and the government so where is the question of such a proposal
9255363 the transfer of land to the board should be complete during the yatra the restoration of the land that was taken away by the governments order should be done
9255364 there was no formula given to us so the question of rejection does not arise
9255365 our spirits are high and we are ready for an agitation for two years or even two decades
9255366 congress is continuing with the british era policy to keep itself in power it constituted the sachhar committee a head count was ordered in the armed forces which is considered as a secular institution
9255367 the muslims are being cheated in the name of reservation i would like to tell them that muslims with a sound economic background would only be able to enjoy the benefits of reservation and the poor man would still not be able to enjoy its benefits
9255368 politics adopts the character of the persons handling it when gandhiji used politics it became a shakti power but in the hands of congress it has become vipatti crisis
9255369 the aiadmk is not a secular party as it had supported the karseva before the babri masjid demolition
9255370 if somebody snaps ties with us it is quite obvious that anyone would feel bad about it
9255371 last year also during this time the state had acute power shortage
9255372 i personally think its too close to some residences and some commercial areas and they have a history of a spill
9255373 the upa chairperson and the prime minister requested the sp to join the union government but the sp politely refused the offer because of its deep and serious engagements in strengthening the samajwadi party in uttar pradesh
9255374 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9255375 shes a person of strong faith she just had her fifth child a downs syndrome child and theres a wonderful quote that she gave about her baby and the fact that she would never ever consider having an abortion just because her child had downs syndrome shes strongly pro life
9255376 playback singing was something i never dreamt of coming so easily i am happy that people like my voice and composers are ready to sign me for their projects
9255377 on the playback front lots of things are happening i am also singing the title tracks of de taali and chandni chowk to china there are also lots of other projects like golmaal returns rama the saviour kambakht ishq and mere khwabon mein jo aaye
9255378 for anything to strive it has to be more than just a plastic manufacturing product
9255379 there were some differences and we all wanted to do our own thing i had no option but start everything afresh
9255380 vjing with channel v was a lot of fun though i had to work hard and develop a quick sense of wit i got to travel and meet so many people
9255381 its pretty clear academic preparation is the single most important thing prior to college
9255382 they come to college and they think they can do that again i tell them you cant do it that way you will fail if you think youre going to study two hours a week and get as and bs in college
9255383 i dont think we could push it higher than three out of four without passing out a lot of cheap degrees
9255384 the old notion of survival of the fittest and well weed students out is not the prevailing notion in education anymore
9255385 that doesnt mean there arent individual faculty members out there who feel the gate keeping courses those first level courses should be used as a way of weeding out students who arent academically tough enough to cut it in their major
9255386 an old school attitude that is in fact dying out as we take increasing responsibility for the success of our students
9255387 youve got to get beyond algebra 2 in high school
9255388 you dont have a lot of juniors and seniors who go on probation
9255389 what that does is to cut out the vast majority of students who enter college every year and dont do it full time and often have dropped out and come back
9255390 if we allow negative momentum to start early the consequences will snowball
9255391 the kind of neglect that has been shown in our foreign policy in last four years did not happen in all the years earlier
9255392 silence is not a foreign policy the presence of india is invisible invisibility is not a policy its a surrender to forces detrimental to india
9255393 i will not be surprised if in months to come we find chinese sitting on the embankments of kosi river
9255394 entire neighbourhood of the country is in a state of turmoil the country is surrounded either by failed states or those becoming failed
9255395 you take the condition of a person who already had seizures you can easily stimulate that problem with that type of device
9255396 although the additional finding that i find myself emphasizing is its not 100 percent safe
9255397 when you feel you need to lay hands on somebody to control them physically you are authorized to use a taser
9255398 theres going to be a high level of injury the reason the taser is so effective in law enforcement is because it reduces and minimizes that type of injury
9255399 small and mid sized arts organizations go up and down because theyre usually based on the work of a small amount of people
9255400 thats whats so sad about it what they were already bringing to the company and losing people who were already dedicated
9255401 now i will be moving back and forth because i see things in this area are a little off balance
9255402 were very open to new students and we want to do whatever we can to bring them in but it takes a lot of dedication
9255403 people come into this and think its like sweating to the oldies but its a philosophy in life
9255404 its a holistic life changing art thats what separates it from other arts it demands you to become more conscious of other people and of how you carry yourself which is what martial arts are about in the first place
9255405 you have to have discipline respect and you learn about your african culture
9255406 its taken longer but were getting a much better trail as a result
9255407 the projects along the mon wharf are all major construction projects that cost a lot of money and require a lot of permits
9255408 what im saying now is that this trail will be worth the wait
9255409 the switchback is a major project because of the vertical distance and also because we want the ramp system to meet universal access standards
9255410 we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9255411 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal
9255412 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9255413 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9255414 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9255415 the wind here is terrible this is looking very bad
9255416 basically we had planned a talent hunt programme but with the heavy rains the ground condition will not be not that conducive at the eden now so we dont want to take a chance in that case it will be a courtesy visit with john buchanan meeting the officials and the kkr players
9255417 i am a threat to no one mr obama doesnt trump my constitutional rights the president of the united states doesnt trump my constitutional rights
9255418 i had a bible in one hand and an apple in the other i was going to pass out my fliers on the rights of law abiding americans to carry guns but i never got the chance
9255419 our people did talk to him he never entered the event area
9255420 they cuffed me and it wasnt fun my arms are as big as sewer pipes
9255421 didnt even give me a receipt for it there were lots of violations of my constitutional rights
9255422 the right of the people to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state shall not be questioned
9255423 i didnt think id get within a mile of the rally
9255424 i actually like sen obama but i havent made up my mind on whether im going to vote for him or for senator john mccain
9255425 these places were far more organised than your average medieval town
9255426 was looking for stone cities he was looking for athens
9255427 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9255428 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9255429 i am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things
9255430 a lot of times their eyes are bigger than their stomach
9255431 if you have stuff you should be able to use a tray
9255432 in his discussion with me he stepped down because his situation with georgia was going to be dragging on for quite a while
9255433 obviously the situation that happened to francois sainfort and julie jacko has not been a positive one for us
9255434 we have cooperated with the georgia attorney generals office and we were led to understand that they were going to be deciding what path to go down by the end of august or early september
9255435 the last thing that i heard through the us office of general counsel was that the attorney generals office in georgia was a long way away from determining what they are going to do
9255436 what im hopeful for is that the georgia attorney general will choose not to file charges and that they can continue here in their faculty leadership roles
9255437 we have certain issues with expenses that were charged to both institutions that we are looking at which are related to but not the same as issues that are of apparent concern to georgia attorney generals office
9255438 we have only limited ability to obtain documents until they are done with their investigation
9255439 they agreed its needed thats why were so terribly disappointed in the pennsylvania decision
9255440 west virginia agreed that you cant look at a regional project in a vacuum
9255441 a grandiose answer to a minor or even non existent problem
9255442 based on our review of the entire record we have concluded that little or no need for reinforcement exists and or non intrusive options are available and probably should have been put in place before now
9255443 granting approval of the 502 junction to virginia segment at this juncture rewards a lack of foresight and proper maintenance and has policy implications for the location of future generation
9255444 we are understandably pleased with the conclusion of the judges who confirmed that these lines are not needed for reliability and are not in the best interest of pennsylvania
9255445 the future of pennsylvanias energy independence is dependent on forward thinking clear eyed decisions such as this
9255446 we stand by both projects because we feel they are needed
9255447 we need new lines thats what it really comes down to whether you want them in your backyard or not
9255448 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9255449 the shri amarnathji yatra which has been going on for many centuries is a shining symbol of communal harmony and brotherhood in jammu and kashmir and reflective of the states composite heritage
9255450 sadly certain decisions of the state government relating to the yatra created misunderstandings which led to controversy and agitation and loss of many precious lives apart from the damage to property there has been a colossal loss to the states economy in different sectors like trade transport industry horticulture and tourism
9255451 the state government shall set aside for the use by shri amarnathji shrine board exclusively the land in baltal and domail comprising an area of 800 kanals traditionally under use for the annual yatra purposes the proprietary status or ownership or title of the land shall not undergo any change
9255452 raising of temporary pre fabricated accommodation establishment of tented accommodation by private camping agencies and setting up of the shops by shopkeepers locals permanent residents of the state facilities for ponywallahs and pithuwallahs
9255453 provisions of medical facilities setting up of free langars by private persons and groups which are licensed by the board facilities for helicopter operations or parking of vehicles also arrangements of security by local police and para military forces and other security agencies as per the arrangements in place here to fore and undertaking measures relating to soil conservation land protection and preservation of ecology
9255454 as regards the registration of criminal cases against various persons during the period of agitation it is agreed that all cases of non serious nature which shall mean bailable and compoundable will be withdrawn
9255455 the remaining cases will be reviewed on the merits of each case by a committee headed by anil goswami principal secretary home within 60 days till the completion of this process no action will be taken in such cases also specific allegations of atrocities on agitators based on prima facie evidence could also be looked into by this committee
9255456 further a working group under the chairmanship of chief secretary will address all compensation issues relating to both jammu and kashmir divisions and the central government will be approached for extending enabling financial support to the state government for this purpose within a period of two months
9255457 to make the exercise meaningful one representative from each of the affected sectors will be associated with the deliberations of the working group
9255458 the sasb will be reconstituted keeping in view the provisions of the act and the past precedents
9255459 id say ive taken little steps but for the most part im gaining confidence day to day
9255460 im fortunate to have a good defense to look at in practice so when the game comes its easy for me
9255461 i just take it for what it is im just happy to have the opportunity
9255462 deep down inside sometimes you want a couple plays back but thats the way the cookie crumbles i did the best i could do it was totally up to them
9255463 my whole thing was to try and come out this year and make some plays and make sure i made it harder for them to make that decision
9255464 its part of a round of next steps in our park improvement plan
9255465 theyve been using them quite a bit and theyve been damaging the trails making it harder for walkers and runners to use them
9255466 weve invested a lot of money in those areas recently and they are getting damaged from people parking there
9255467 i am a threat to no one mr obama doesnt trump my constitutional rights the president of the united states doesnt trump my constitutional rights
9255468 i had a bible in one hand and an apple in the other i was going to pass out my fliers on the rights of law abiding americans to carry guns but i never got the chance
9255469 our people did talk to him he never entered the event area
9255470 they cuffed me and it wasnt fun my arms are as big as sewer pipes
9255471 didnt even give me a receipt for it there were lots of violations of my constitutional rights
9255472 the right of the people to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state shall not be questioned
9255473 i didnt think id get within a mile of the rally
9255474 i actually like sen obama but i havent made up my mind on whether im going to vote for him or for senator john mccain
9255475 we have contributed to the infrastructure in peters township for many years
9255476 its taken longer but were getting a much better trail as a result
9255477 the projects along the mon wharf are all major construction projects that cost a lot of money and require a lot of permits
9255478 what im saying now is that this trail will be worth the wait
9255479 the switchback is a major project because of the vertical distance and also because we want the ramp system to meet universal access standards
9255480 i didnt want to let my mother down i wanted to do everything right it wasnt working for me in seattle i came down here for a new beginning i did everything i was supposed to do and im still doing everything im supposed to do
9255481 you want to wrap up and get under those pads you dont want to just hit him maybe hell bounce off you want to hit him as hard as you can every time
9255482 it takes a lot of vision and you cant be scared you have to hit the holes and do what you have to do to make the tackle you have to take the guy out
9255483 we tease him a little bit call him vanilla ice sometimes
9255484 he will start to groove a little bit when the music comes on
9255485 you need to manage the game it is not incumbent on you going out there and trying to win it late in the game yeah you might have to thats ok youre ready to do that
9255486 kids grow up dreaming about these opportunities i hope he enjoys it
9255487 after workouts one morning he said lets go get a breakfast burrito
9255488 i didnt want to go all the way to jose bs he said no there is a place on campus northern lights theyre great trust me
9255489 weve found other hotels for those passengers who were unable to stay on in their accommodation
9255490 there were all these traffic jams because there were mobs rioting and stuff and to get out of there we walked for a kilometre and climbed the fence to get into the airport
9255491 on the way to the airport it was a bit scary to be honest and we panicked because weve never seen real shooting guns
9255492 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9255493 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9255494 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9255495 we saw how law enforcement officials in london were able to track the suspects using their surveillance system during the july 2005 terrorist attack
9255496 it will be critical because now our police officers who have data mobile units in their cars will be able to tap into the camera network and have a sense of what is going on before they get to a crime scene
9255497 the fastest way to identify violent crime and move against it
9255498 i assume the presentation you three are working on will deal with those things in addition to volcanoes and wind
9255499 you passed out in the van and i carried you up like a bride
9255500 it will be excruciating youre all about to go to hell
9255501 why else would he have known to put on a windbreaker for a long drenching night
9255502 you can always take layers off you cant always put them on
9255503 there was consideration to go for it on fourth down in the first half
9255504 but i thought we were playing good defense then so we played the field position game because you dont want to give their offense an opportunity they are a veteran group that has scored a lot of points and knows how to do it
9255505 one time it worked out the punt was downed at the 6 one time the ball went into the end zone
9255506 i think austin ransom being the leading tackler shows what kind of young man he is
9255507 when shane murray got hurt we had not been pleased with where we were at with a couple of young linebackers austin is a smart guy and the right guy against this style of offense he gave us a chance to cover players since he could run a little quicker than some of our other linebackers
9255508 they dont deserve to be ranked ahead of us now
9255509 i thought he played solid and did everything he could do
9255510 i have very carefully selected a set list for your maximum enjoyment
9255511 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on the top of big brown to beat the white sox right now hes on a roll
9255512 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it whoever hits in front of him this guy right now is on fire no matter what you throw there hes going to get it i cant believe it you can change professions from one year to another to go from the kentucky derby to the boston team stats ballpark and perform thats amazing
9255513 i got to the yard and found out that youk was sick and i told david he better stop bitching about getting pitches to hit because he got a lot tonight
9255514 pedroia said this was long overdue and ortiz said he was retiring
9255515 they just came down and put it in the system
9255516 average is about the worst thing you can say about somebody
9255517 weve been going against each other for 30 days so we were ready to go
9255518 this win really validates all the hard work we put in
9255519 when vanessa plays like that she gives us a huge lift
9255520 as a coach you always like it when those threes go down
9255521 she hit a couple big shots we found a play we were able to go to
9255522 but i definitely dont like mccain because of the eight years with bush well see
9255523 i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9255524 everyone here is pro coal thats what the economy is built on
9255525 everything i hear he seems to be more anti coal
9255526 all hes going to do is raise your taxes spend spend spend
9255527 anything hes going to do is going to enlarge government and raise taxes to support larger government
9255528 theres probably not been enough money printed to support his plans
9255529 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9255530 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9255531 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9255532 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9255533 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9255534 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9255535 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9255536 to put the problem in perspective fannie and freddie have a collective market value of 8 1 billion dollars in insurance protection exposure for more than 5 5 trillion in insured mortgage instruments
9255537 if youve got a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out
9255538 if youve got a bazooka and people know youve got it you may not have to take it out
9255539 we do not believe the gses will be successfulin raising capital in the public markets on economically feasible terms
9255540 this will likely mark the end of the gses in their current format as an awkward public private hybrid we believe the gses will be nationalized in some form
9255541 after what happened with bear stearns the government cant come in and save the equity holders
9255542 the treasury may have to bail out holders of their preferred shares as well as their debt otherwise small banks may suffer another round of large losses
9255543 breaking them up would be messier than some critics think and nationalization isnt the best way to bring mortgage rates back down
9255544 better would be an unequivocal statement from the treasury department saying that the gses debt holders will not lose money whatever policymakers decide to do they should do it quickly as the uncertainty threatens to upend the fragile financial system and housing market
9255545 weve found other hotels for those passengers who were unable to stay on in their accommodation
9255546 there were all these traffic jams because there were mobs rioting and stuff and to get out of there we walked for a kilometre and climbed the fence to get into the airport
9255547 on the way to the airport it was a bit scary to be honest and we panicked because weve never seen real shooting guns
9255548 thats what happens when you worry about the parties more than the programming
9255549 im just not drunk enough to sleep with a geek
9255550 we found that especially services are facing problems displaying dual prices 89 percent of them did not comply with the norms
9255551 people do not pay much attention to dual prices yet but they have to start getting used to it
9255552 i am not sure whether our customers have even noticed dual prices
9255553 we had to stay at work late and rewrite the price tags by hand
9255554 it the campaign is not fair to small tradesmen who have to bear all the costs alone we would like to be optimistic about the euro introduction but so far it has brought only trouble cost and the fear of fines
9255555 the withdrawal of british and irish buyers from the bulgarian market was prompted by the financial crisis in their countries but also by the bad infrastructure and the excess of concrete here
9255556 a decline in speculative investment will have a sanitising effect on the economy
9255557 real estate for bulgaria was like oil and gold for other countries
9255558 more and more often we come to a point where we see how money that we have reasons to believe came from criminal activities is wired through foreign banks and returned here in the form of investment
9255559 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9255560 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9255561 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9255562 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9255563 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9255564 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf
9255565 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9255566 if anything block it and prevent it from going to the outfield
9255567 it just ended up going in the glove i feel fortunate i could make that play
9255568 the liver if neglected invariably leads to cirrhosis of course you are all familiar with the symptoms of cirrhosis
9255569 sure cirrhosis are red so violets are blue so sugar is sweet so so are you
9255570 the spirit of this film its fierceness and gaiety the total absence of well constructed constructive diagnosis and prescription the enormous liberating force of its quasi nihilism its humor directness kindliness criminality and guile form for me as satisfying a revolutionary expression as i know
9255571 if you cant be an athlete be an athletic supporter
9255572 poor france will be in sorry shape in 10 years
9255573 how would you overcome the staging difficulties posed by ibsens rosmerholm
9255574 the banks growth projections are likely to be distinctly lower
9255575 but because the upside risks for price stability remain high the bank will continue to keep all its options open
9255576 business surveys so far suggest that eurozone gdp gross domestic product will fall again in the third quarter implying that the region is in the midst of a technical recession
9255577 the ecb may be forced into a rate cut debate early next year
9255578 i truly believe it will happen i truly believe it will be built and it will be what everyone thinks it should be
9255579 we all agree its going to be a huge anchor for the borough
9255580 were just very excited that things are really starting to roll now and everything is starting to fall into place
9255581 the library is the centerpiece of any town its going to draw people into this area whove never been here before
9255582 people would love to see that shovel in the ground and so would we its been a long process
9255583 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed amp we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team
9255584 i would definately sic make sure i got caught and impaled
9255585 nikki has a black eye from all the girls pushing me out of the way to get prime position by the window seeing naked aussies in rooms across from us
9255586 im quite light hearted and dont take myself seriously i was having a bit of a laugh
9255587 i definitely wouldnt have written those quotes if i knew everybody could read it
9255588 im always so careful to ensure the sport is portrayed in the best possible way we dont drink in public or silly things like that
9255589 the organisation is disappointed that private communications has entered the public domain and players will again be counselled on this matter
9255590 im not sure if im supposed to comment on that but yeah it could have gone either way really
9255591 ill take the goal im not too sure but lucky we got the goal
9255592 we played a fantastic team game it was close all day we were able to just stick at it and stick at it and we sort of managed to get those last couple of goals at the end which were crucial
9255593 must sees dans le q amp a pour son premier film de
9255594 we believe that we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9255595 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9255596 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9255597 in harmony with nature ii photos by donald m robinson
9255598 what thrills me about the finale is you will not see this coming
9255599 the safety and security of the random house building and employees
9255600 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
9255601 wicked is a story about an awkward girl one with nascent magical powers and a steely sense of righteousness who comes up against a ditzy opportunist named glinda and a megalomaniacal dictator calling himself the wizard of oz i modeled the green skinned witch elphaba after my heroines the young virginia woolf for her acerbity and intellect the young laura nyro for her invention and energy and the older emily dickinson for her willingness to retire when the going gets unseemly

9255604 evoke the sort of feeling of shakespeare or greek tragedy that you cant sidestep fate
9255605 i felt fairly liberated because i realized that l frank baum had not come out of the grave to scream at me
9255606 could have been singing the phone book or in sanskrit the hair on the back of my head stood up
9255607 faye arthurss liquid phrasing in blue moon partnered by charles askegard was another special pleasure in a fine cast
9255608 what thrills me about the finale is you will not see this coming
9255609 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9255610 it was exciting i wanted everything to go right we got a lot of plays and executed a lot i dont think i got touched all day
9255611 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9255612 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9255613 brent and royster did all the hard work and i just kind of got in there at the end
9255614 it was fun i was just trying to make some plays show what i could do
9255615 it is unbelievable how many guys can do special things
9255616 i am just so excited to see what the season has for us there are definitely a lot of guys that can create plays
9255617 my goal was to get three scores and i got two
9255618 its grounded with real character stories and emotional stories and whether these kids drive maseratis or whatever mansions they live in we want people in iowa watching going thats how i feel when my dad gets mad at me thats how i feel when someone doesnt like me were trying to tell truthful emotional stories but also keep it pretty funny too
9255619 trust me your concerns about sachs and judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyone has had including jeff and i
9255620 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9255621 he still asks us to give notes on rough cuts and at table reads and on scripts that family will never be apart
9255622 our writing is not gonna change this is who we write this is how we create stories
9255623 were both fathers we like this central family that moves into beverly hills and its a question of how do they hold onto their moral center
9255624 we think this generation of parenting is different than the ones we grew up with we as parents did almost everything that our kids are doing our parents didnt do that its a lot harder to lie to us we know what theyre doing and they cant get away with stuff that they think they are because we did it 20 years ago
9255625 all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed
9255626 wicked is a story about an awkward girl one with nascent magical powers and a steely sense of righteousness who comes up against a ditzy opportunist named glinda and a megalomaniacal dictator calling himself the wizard of oz i modeled the green skinned witch elphaba after my heroines the young virginia woolf for her acerbity and intellect the young laura nyro for her invention and energy and the older emily dickinson for her willingness to retire when the going gets unseemly

9255628 cost of the choices one has to make may bankrupt even the morally soundest
9255629 evoke the sort of feeling of shakespeare or greek tragedy that you cant sidestep fate
9255630 i felt fairly liberated because i realized that l frank baum had not come out of the grave to scream at me
9255631 could have been singing the phone book or in sanskrit the hair on the back of my head stood up
9255632 i said i never looked at it in the first place
9255633 my lord my god show yourself merciful to these lovely people in their automobiles
9255634 i try to bless all the cars everybody needs a blessing
9255635 i hope they dont ever get in any car wrecks because i know that being handicapped physically and mentally will change your life
9255636 a lot of them dont know theyre getting blessed but thats ok
9255637 they arent prepared or they start out too late in the day or they dont know when to turn back
9255638 you should always try to camp with at least one partner so if someone gets hurt the other person can help
9255639 also before you leave for the camping trip be sure to notify someone at home where you are going and when you expect to return
9255640 using a knife to open a can or cut wood can result in a serious laceration
9255641 when you are making a decision think about the consequences
9255642 think about the injuries and the rehab if you make the wrong decision its not worth that its always ok to turn around
9255643 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
9255644 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
9255645 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
9255646 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
9255647 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
9255648 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
9255649 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
9255650 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
9255651 we dont ever try to play great in games we try to play to our capabilities and do it every game thats why we can go across the country into a hostile environment and play so well we dont care where the score goes we just play
9255652 he can strike deep in a heartbeat and we havent had that in the last few years
9255653 john david booty was very conservative and that was fine but mark has that attitude to just seize it he had two deep ball opportunities and hit them both
9255654 mark has unusual qualities and our job as coaches when you have someone with unusual qualities is to bring those qualities to the forefront
9255655 apart from at the start of the second half we were always in control and played the game we love and showed the way we can play
9255656 the improvement comes from a completely different attitude we showed that against twente and did it again tonight the fulham match had come at the start of the season after difficult games including one away in the champions league and maybe we were not ready mentally
9255657 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri
9255658 then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i saw which is what i was upset about i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing but you cant do that joey has done nothing wrong im concerned about my team not individual players
9255659 he has to have an x ray on his ankle hopefully nothing is broken he is the link between the midfield and the strikers which is very important in the game we want to play
9255660 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9255661 i was playing great and he was playing great too
9255662 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9255663 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9255664 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9255665 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9255666 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9255667 i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9255668 the lowest delay per traveler of any city with over a million commuters
9255669 ten percent of commuters get to work by some method other than driving which helps keep congestion to one of the lowest levels in the country
9255670 to serve as a scapegoat for the inappropriate affairs and activities of others
9255671 those two linebackers can really run and close space and the two safeties play like linebackers
9255672 gives him a little bit longer to look at things
9255673 he had to make those passes without having the opportunity to get much of a look at the defense
9255674 we had a lot of open guys i should have hit
9255675 at that point i was trying to do too much trying to get a big gain
9255676 i had an underneath guy open and i should have hit him
9255677 were trying to get into his head were having fun with it
9255678 it would mean a lot there is a lot of pressure going on at the moment
9255679 the cisf brought the actor to us and once rajasekhar produced the original license of the weapon the revolver was returned to him
9255680 i think i understand the game more trying different kind of shots too lately trying to add some variety
9255681 i think the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realise not everything had to be perfect all the time
9255682 thats helped me if i dont have a perfect practice i dont get really upset about the whole tournament i think that helps me to relax
9255683 she did what it took that day and since that time she has gone on to the top 10 so obviously shes a good player
9255684 i thought maybe my last my name was williams owski or something
9255685 they were inseparable they lived together for half a century effectively like husband and wife
9255686 there were repeated allegations during newmans lifetime about his circle of homosexual friends it is uncertain whether their relationship involved sex it is quite likely that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sexual relations but abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation
9255687 an act of dishonesty and betrayal by the homophobes in the vatican
9255688 part of the established procedure prior to a beatification requires that if the body of the new beatus exists then it must be exhumed inspected and transferred to a place of honor befitting the persons new status
9255689 as a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself cardinal newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the holy see and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable
9255690 if we want to unleash the energy hidden under north slope tundra
9255691 the best way to get the job done is to unleash the energy of a new generation of leaders
9255692 clean campaigns that stick to the issues and stick to the truth
9255693 wayward ammunition causes damages when politicians run negative campaigns aimed toward opponents feet instead of shooting straight with voters
9255694 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9255695 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9255696 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky if they see one
9255697 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9255698 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9255699 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing

9255718 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9255719 we have to try and be on our game here
9255720 this is the type of track we have been struggling with this year
9255721 it feels good to have a little cushion for sure but with my luck being so bad this season ill never count any cushion as enough unless im locked in
9255722 we just havent had the runs havent had the cars and when we did have the cars we havent been able to put it together
9255723 you dont have to win a race to win the championship
9255724 we do need to get our performance up a bit to compete with kyle and carl
9255725 no matter where youre at when you start the chase you have to be ready when the chase starts and be able to seize that opportunity
9255726 i feel like if we just go out and not make many mistakes kind of like our whole year if we dont hurt ourselves i think well be fine
9255727 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9255728 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital police had to use capsicum spray with the crowd
9255729 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9255730 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9255731 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing
9255732 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9255733 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9255734 there were a lot of doubters but we proved that the ciaa is a football conference
9255735 our conference can play with anybody catawba is a good team
9255736 what they did for us in there was pretty outstanding the trouble they went to
9255737 he thought he jones might be a risk to me
9255738 he should do his time first i think they should have thought a bit more about what they were doing
9255739 there were a number of investigations made to ensure the bride or any other family members including children were not at risk
9255740 we must act urgently to improve our childrens performance in maths and encourage those with aptitude to go on to study it
9255741 literacy and numeracy in the primary years are crucially important to ensuring all students participate in education and make a positive transition to work and learning in adult life
9255742 students who do not achieve the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are least likely to stay on through secondary school or to end up in further study and employment
9255743 i came all the way from minnesota and all i got was crabs from ars
9255744 to say the least i cant tell you how disappointed our football team is considering how much work and effort was put into the start of the season
9255745 all during training camp we protected the ball we did a good job on turnovers we have been smart with the ball and to go out there today and put the ball on the ground several different ways that makes it very difficult
9255746 i thought our players came out and were ready to play but working hard just gives you a chance to win it doesnt guarantee anything i told the players this is the lesson to learn from this game
9255747 we felt like we wanted points and we wanted to go in and feel good about it
9255748 we didnt want to take a chance for a sack and we didnt want to take a chance on a turnover and i think any time you are in that situation and you have a chance to get three points you take the three points because if you take a chance and throw a pass and it gets deflected or you turn it over or you take a sack now you are not giving your team a chance to win
9255749 i think some people doubted how good we are i hope everyone realizes how hard it is to win on the road against a bcs program i dont care who it is in our league it is big
9255750 we are not supposed to beat these people we are not supposed to do that but our kids relish these games
9255751 our greatest fear is an adult would pass it to an infant who has not yet received the pertussis vaccine
9255752 he got us on a bad day hes ok he didnt really impress me
9255753 i thought his poise and his mound presence were outstanding
9255754 early on a lot of fastballs he fell behind the first hitter as he got into the game he started using his changeup and his breaking ball hes got enough on his fastball and hes got some deception hes throwing out of his ear and he can get some downward angle on that fastball
9255755 not only in that inning but in a couple as i got myself into a little bit of trouble and i minimized the damage
9255756 it could have been a lot worse than what it was but i made some pitches at the right time and luckily it worked out for the best
9255757 i think it was inevitable that i was going to walk the first guy because my heart was pounding pretty hard but after that first guy i settled down got into a rhythm
9255758 i think at this point they still expect lawrence tynes to be healthy and be able to kick this year
9255759 but i dont think anybody has a timetable on that
9255760 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9255761 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9255762 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9255763 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9255764 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9255765 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9255766 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9255767 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9255768 as much as i loathe obama biden i cant in good conscience vote for a mccain palin ticket palin has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i simply dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc
9255769 on the face of it mccain has failed the ultimate test that any presidential candidate must face in picking a running mate selecting someone who is unambiguously qualified to be president
9255770 gregg erickson she is strongly in favor of oil development she just wants the state to get a bigger share of the profits and wants the companies to develop their alaska resources faster than the companies consider profitable or prudent
9255771 finding the person most qualified to step in and assume the presidency
9255772 but then this nation has historically afforded certain privileges to its military personnel and the old navy flyer john mccain is confident he has earned a pass
9255773 for an old man so apt at playing president john mccain iii badly misjudges the important demands of the office he seeks
9255774 that is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons even death may die
9255775 matthews had to school buchanan on not calling her a
9255776 anyway its a dilemma for the republican party because theyve spent the last 40 years exploiting prejudice but much of their best talent doesnt fit the evangelical white male model romney palin jindal
9255777 the candidate s wife tells abc s this week that obama s derision of the mccain family s wealth was unfair and offensive my father had nothing he and my mother sold everything they had to raise 10 000 i m proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me in thursday s stadium speech obama says mccain doesn t know and doesn t get what ordinary americans are experiencing
9255778 i had been reluctant to acknowledge how flawed and dead the conservative movement has become thats over now no more excuses no more clinging to old visions of rational discourse and principled debate i really have witnessed the death of conservatism and its replacement by a kind of toxic babbitry which would be merely laughable or cringeworthy if it were not also so extraordinarily dangerous
9255779 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9255780 governor palin was caught off guard by bob lesters reference to senate president lyda green
9255781 small town mayor with a taste for mooseburgers to the governors office
9255782 refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9255783 minneapolis will not soon be selected again by the republicans as a place for holding a national convention

9255785 according to the ketchikan daily news edition on august 8 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the primary election campaign people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because they ve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan area s potential for expansion and growth palin said alaska s congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge as part of a package deal and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge and according to the ketchikan daily news on september 29 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the general election campaign part of my agenda is making sure that southeast is heard that your projects are important that we go to bat for southeast when we re up against federal influences that aren t in the best interest of southeast she cited the widespread negative attention focused on the gravina island crossing project we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that s so negative palin says
9255786 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9255787 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9255788 only the ones that dont care about reproductive or womens rights some at now sees it as cynical
9255789 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9255790 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9255791 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9255792 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9255793 i dont think it was women in the center the swing voters could be pulled in though shes compelling
9255794 while i share the view that in the end the vp choice doesn t mean much

9255811 this is especially valuable for the placement of apostrophes in possessives we would all say bosss office but absurdities such as boss office frequently appear in print probably because of some silly rule

9255815 would it seem foolish to you to consider the concept that the trampling of languages mores is symptomatic of societys general disdain for its laws and their enforcement or that the laziness of modern american usage parallels our decline as a science engineering mathematics powerhouse

9255831 data from european demographers and statistical bureaus show that a majority of children in sweden and norway are now born out of wedlock as are 60 percent of first born children in denmark
9255832 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage

9255836 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

9255859 we ask whether or not a candidate is religious because in the eyes of most americans the only valid expression of morality is through religion i dont agree with that because i have plenty of highly ethical friends who claim no religious faith whatsoever

9255861 cuts are almost sure to also hit people in several other regions in central and western bulgaria whose drinking water supplies are not guaranteed by nearby dams but come exclusively from high mountain and spring catchments
9255862 moreover the majority of this water flows downriver into neighbouring countries and the only way to ensure constant stocks of clean water is through a system of dams
9255863 in bulgaria there is a common view that water is a gift from god it does not cost anything and is not worth saving this is absolutely not true
9255864 it is a crime to use drinking water for irrigation when people do not have enough to drink
9255865 we used to be rather wasteful but things are changing

9255871 the fateful word confronting our generation is not terror but globalisation it is the rise of india and china not the goings on in the mountains of pakistan that will leave their imprint on this era

9255876 families throughout the ages sought advice from trusted elders in their community be they tribal or clan leaders religious leaders those thought to be sages or a special person deemed to be able to be helpful

9255882 weve been to washington d c and other places and this is one of the cleanest prettiest cities with the nicest people weve ever seen we saw more water coming in on the airplane than we have in the whole state of arizona
9255883 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but
9255884 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9255885 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9255886 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9255887 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9255888 discussions strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates he asked a lot of questions and listened didnt tip his hand to too many of us he was very insistent that this process often wounds people and we were to stay very quiet
9255889 we obviously were looking at a lot of different options
9255890 we looked at base options women pro choice pro life people outside the party it was a very broad and deep search most of the people we checked out never made it into the public domain and some speculated on were very very competitive for the job
9255891 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation just because everyone thought it was going to be mitt romney for a month and then it was going to be joe lieberman for a month
9255892 shes got an ability that far exceeds her tenure in office
9255893 it appears chicken is still being used as a political tool
9255894 but theyre still the most significant and if they quit buying that would certainly dull that bright spot
9255895 i dont think they deserved to be put on probation
9255896 it just depends on how intense that meeting was with nascar how serious they are about the probation
9255897 there are probations that are like a slap on the hand and then there are probations where they might have you by the shirt saying you do this again youre really in trouble
9255898 thats really where the question lies im not really sure what type of probation theyre on
9255899 i know its one word but it might have many levels to it
9255900 what the heck they dont get it you know what i mean
9255901 theyve messed up the winston and the all star race and theyre messing up the shootout
9255902 they ought to line us up and make us run 10 laps
9255903 they want us to run around there for 25 laps first like a 25 lap segment that would be cool but then 10 laps to go all or nothing thats what the fans want thats what the drivers want
9255904 that last segment being 50 laps i mean were all just going to sit there for 30
9255905 i dont know what the focus group is theyre talking to to get these kind of formats
9255906 its frustrating because i want to like those races i dont want to dread them and right now im dreading running them because the formats arent fun
9255907 i just hate the format its not exciting its not fun its 50 laps at the end right thats too long what for this is a shootout were going to stroke the first 30 laps
9255908 rick hendrick has given me an incredible opportunity ive got a great team every piece of it has just got to work together
9255909 weve got to find some harmony and get back to where we were at the beginning of the year
9255910 weve got to get our head on our shoulders weve been messing up a little bit and struggling with the car
9255911 but weve been trying some stuff too were not really running what we ran at the start of the year and maybe we need to learn a lesson and move on
9255912 but with these cars youve got to move out of the box and see what the tricks are
9255913 carl edwards is super fast here hes obviously got a great set up so we have to figure out what that is
9255914 our old stuff is decent but we aint going to outrun him with that
9255915 weve got to work harder but sometimes when you try to find a trick set up you go the wrong way
9255916 i made a mistake and that was that that was against the rules and i just didnt know anybody was watching back there
9255917 he came and told me he was having a couple of meetings with roger and he didnt know what to do and he just needed somebody to tell him what was right
9255918 i told him i could tell him what i thought but that rick hendrick would be the best person to talk to
9255919 i think brad did the right thing hes got a great opportunity where hes at hes running great with the nationwide team would you want to trade where you are and opportunities with rick in the future at the cup level with where you could be with roger
9255920 if he could get the deal with rick hed have a better chance of running better and i would hope that happens i told him if i was building a cup team i would tell him to go drive for roger
9255921 you have to control what youre allowing the interviewer to know and see
9255922 you kind of feel like youre sticking it to the system when you let them all see all and tell all because we kind of get caged i guess a little bit and put in a box sometimes
9255923 so maybe he was just blowing off some steam in an area where he knows he can and probably get away with it
9255924 if you are interviewed by playboy youre going to talk about your sex life theyre going to ask you about it youre not going to talk about that in the boston globe know what i mean
9255925 we were in a very awkward situation at the start of the year and there was just so much press back and forth about him and me
9255926 we just never had the urge to reach out to each other
9255927 but more recently in the last half of the season i think weve grown
9255928 obviously hes got to be super happy about how things are going for him and i feel pretty good about my situation i think weve grown to be able to accommodate each other
9255929 ive got to get jason keller before he retires you all remember my first race at myrtle beach he come off the wall and spun me out i was running sixth
9255930 its like carl said you ask yourself if youre in that situation what would the guy do if the roles were reversed and thats how you drive people thats how you race people
9255931 they are totally different personalities but the fans respect what they are on track and what theyre doing
9255932 i hope to be in there and have you guys talking about three guys here pretty soon and showing you im not so pc and i can get in there and spin people out too
9255933 i think wide receiver is the biggest question as far as injuries are concerned and well just have to see how that goes over the next few days thats what well do look at the waiver wire when it comes out and see if theres anybody that can help us
9255934 obviously we were sorting through the roster cuts this morning and the timing wasnt very good thats for sure
9255935 but we had difficult decisions and it came down to we had a couple of guys we know who we had here last year and we made the decision to keep them
9255936 he had great respect from the players he provided veteran leadership and experience he played well it came down to whenever you look at those two reserve safety spots you look at safety plus special teams we felt that nate and quentin both did a good job on special teams and theyre good young players but that was an extremely difficult decision because terrence came in and played well for us and really brought a lot of intangibles into the locker room
9255937 youd always like to add another but in the scope of it you have to work with the numbers and thats just sort of how it fell
9255938 if you write down your goals and put them in a place you see them every day youre a lot more motivated to do it
9255939 not only could i afford it but i also had money for aero bars
9255940 we thought that rather than having such a huge goal of college too abstract if we broke it down into smaller pieces and gave him something that he was interested in food that the idea of saving wouldnt be so daunting
9255941 it doesnt matter what it is its like it became a competition with himself to save money
9255942 fiscal responsibility at times means less immediate gratification but the pride i feel in reaching a financial goal for a major purchase far outweighs the small sacrifices needed to attain it
9255943 anything that can be carved out and not necessarily viewed as core to the retail commercial bank is potentially fair game
9255944 i think at this point we can assume there are a number of businesses on the table
9255945 stephen is a proven business leader with the credentials and experience to lead our management team accelerate our growth and improve the efficiency of our fulfillment organization
9255946 were new with our new partners boston ventures david zucker our new ceo is doing a great job hes peddling 900 mph trying to get hold of everything
9255947 what weve been missing are a lot of the business decisions that need to be made and a lot of the business connections we need
9255948 our guys are being very strategic in how we do it i have to make a good case for what i think we need to buy and that makes me feel good because i told them before this transaction went down that its not going to happen overnight
9255949 and if it does happen overnight it wont last like bobby ginn last year
9255950 as far as driver lineup for next year we are very aggressive on moving forward
9255951 were still working on those plans kyle will run some races next year and bobby will have a teammate that we hope can grow into that b level or a level player
9255952 if you look at dodge teams as a whole and i dont feel comfortable saying this but we are the weaker teams
9255953 i was on the other side when i was with rick hendrick and i saw what rick put into it how committed he was and how involved he was in making sure he got the right people in the right places
9255954 i could get going on a tirade about car owners they like to sit in the big meetings and complain about how the manufacturers arent committed but the real commitment starts here at the top
9255955 but weve got to use the money weve got wisely
9255956 everyone is a little up in arms over these test dates for next year well get 24 nascar approved testing days at nascar tour tracks but our team has already tested 30 times this year at non nascar cup tracks like kentucky under the old rules
9255957 they do a nice job of getting us on national television so we can get big sponsors so we just have to use our head count as effectively as possible and get the most out of your folks
9255958 and the question now has to be how long will rick and jack and those guys maintain those head counts
9255959 i think there have probably been conversations among rick and jack and chip and felix sabates and the others
9255960 people who havent been watching their head counts will have to start watching their head counts because the people are very expensive
9255961 when you look at the manufacturers their support is great but when you look at a teams budget the manufacturers part is the smallest piece of the pie
9255962 from where we sit dodge has done everything theyd said theyd do and theyre always offering to do more whether its more seven post computer time or more wind tunnel time
9255963 that is one area we all feel weve been dragging our feet on the development of that engine
9255964 the twins just announced their september minor league callups pitchers bobby korecky philip humber jose mijares infielders matt tolbert and matt macri outfielder jason pridie and catcher ryan jorgensen
9255965 i couldnt give my all because of my left hand
9255966 i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best
9255967 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9255968 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9255969 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9255970 i joked someone would have to push me over the finish line if i got here first
9255971 single speeding is a bit stupid but at the same time the simplicity is lovely
9255972 its restrictive but within those constraints its easier theres your bike now get on with it
9255973 if a fast rider comes through hecklers corner and people empty beer over him thats just fine
9255974 hes not supposed to be on the phone with his manager
9255975 i get paid to race bikes but most people out here are fun loving beer drinking riders who dont get paid to race bikes
9255976 i dont need to show up here and be a pro
9255977 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9255978 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9255979 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9255980 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9255981 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9255982 i missed some easy ones and we had some dropped balls we missed some blocks we didnt execute on third down it was an all around bad game for the whole team
9255983 we would make a good play then have a down play
9255984 we hit coco on that first play and everybody got excited and then the next thing you know you get slammed
9255985 we executed last year against michigan we just couldnt do it this time
9255986 we just werent as sharp we really had problems executing when they blitzed
9255987 we came off the football and did things on offense and defense that we need to do
9255988 the offensive line open up big holes and i just found them
9255989 we were all running to the ball and playing hard but we just did not execute our calls
9255990 it was a season opener and you dont know what to expect
9255991 guys think that we could have played better we had a lot of mistakes a lot of penalties a lot of dropped balls but for a first game theres nothing better than coming on the road and taking a victory home
9255992 its going to be nice to be at home and play ole miss
9255993 i told our players that theyre just going to have to expect that the stakes are going to keep going up every week
9255994 we definitely could have played better especially on the defensive side of the ball we gave away a few gifts missed tackles 15 yard penalties im looking forward to this saturday and hopefully we can play better
9255995 honestly i thought when he had time he did a good job of keeping his eyes down the field and finding receivers
9255996 but i thought what he did best was move around the pocket really well
9255997 weve got to run the football better theres no question that would be my biggest disappointment
9255998 they really felt like they wanted to talk to the other player and relieve him of that burden
9255999 we all talk about being good christians and living good lives but that was one of the most selfless acts ive ever seen
9256000 you just cant separate the game from what happened i just want to honor the gfellers and matt and my kids that i have now
9256001 he has made it okay to be patriotic again ive never felt this way in my entire life
9256002 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9256003 this election has never been about me its been about you
9256004 japans decision is very disappointing the south korean government should take immediate actions against the move
9256005 i still feel like if im 1 on 1 with somebody i can beat them but everybody looks at me as a quarterback i look at myself as a quarterback also but its a little different ive got to change my mind set i guess well see
9256006 its always good to be out there playing with the guys this is really an opportunity for the young guys to get evaluated and see what they can do but its time to get the show going
9256007 training camp is behind me and the next thing is the real deal
9256008 im excited im just ready to get the ball rolling
9256009 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
9256010 and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
9256011 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
9256012 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in
9256013 if youre turned on by this then we didnt do our job very well
9256014 the election of 2000 just after the supreme court decision protests riots in the major cities a movement to abolish the electoral college defeat of the bill in congress a new movement led by the mayor and borough presidents of new york city secession federal troops attack
9256015 o nce you witness violence on that scale it isnt difficult to imagine something worse and once your mind is capable of doing that you understand that the worst possibilities of the imagination are the country you live in
9256016 my name is towner whitney no thats not exactly true my real first name is sophya never believe me i lie all the time i am a crazy woman that last part is true
9256017 i have left the black sea my skin golden and salty and my hair tangled brighter from the sun to take the train that crosses the land by the violet blue sea and the sunflower fields near bucharest then cuts through mountains into resin pungent forest
9256018 a damnable lie a black infernal creation of a twisted distorted mind
9256019 obscene in the extreme the burning and banning of john steinbecks the grapes of wrath
9256020 when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need
9256021 the right of persons to move freely from state to state
9256022 occupies a more protected position in our constitutional system than does the movement of cattle fruit steel and coal
9256023 its grounded with real character stories and emotional stories and whether these kids drive maseratis or whatever mansions they live in we want people in iowa watching going thats how i feel when my dad gets mad at me thats how i feel when someone doesnt like me were trying to tell truthful emotional stories but also keep it pretty funny too
9256024 trust me your concerns about sachs and judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyone has had including jeff and i
9256025 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9256026 he still asks us to give notes on rough cuts and at table reads and on scripts that family will never be apart
9256027 our writing is not gonna change this is who we write this is how we create stories
9256028 were both fathers we like this central family that moves into beverly hills and its a question of how do they hold onto their moral center
9256029 we think this generation of parenting is different than the ones we grew up with we as parents did almost everything that our kids are doing our parents didnt do that its a lot harder to lie to us we know what theyre doing and they cant get away with stuff that they think they are because we did it 20 years ago
9256030 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9256031 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9256032 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9256033 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9256034 unless you study the game you dont understand the implications of a win like that
9256035 i didnt hear a whistle it was probably some pitt guy blowing the whistle
9256036 we made so many mistakes today and the defense had my number
9256037 im sure the team is hurt im sure nobody expected this its tough
9256038 we were hearing everything about lesean mccoy and their great running game so we wanted to make sure we handled that and tried to get them into passing
9256039 that bowl loss lingered and i get asked about that to this day thats done i hope
9256040 they gave us some unusual formations and we had a tough time adjusting to it
9256041 it would have been nice to get a touchdown but you know we follow the leader wannstedt

9256051 i would say its not been quite as good this summer the fishing he said
9256052 we played a good game and proved we are a changed side from last season
9256053 it was nice to be able repay the club for all their hard work with some goals
9256054 he was playing unbelievable in the first two sets hitting serves bang on the line and hitting his forehand huge
9256055 but i managed to fight and when i broke him in the third set for the first time in the match i started to feel a little better i just started to return a bit better as the match went on
9256056 today i played better than the last days i started playing well and today i served very well
9256057 the truth is that i was practising much better yesterday than the first few days
9256058 are like going back to the carter era all it did was make us more dependent on foreign oil
9256059 high fructose corn syrup does not appear to contribute to obesity more than other caloric sweeteners
9256060 eighty per cent of bone mass is accrued in the first 20 years and especially around puberty due to the circulating hormones this study targets a window of opportunity in adolescence to maximise peak bone mass with high intensity weight bearing activity
9256061 peak height velocity is at different ages in boys and girls most boys in the group were right at that stage while most girls in the study were past puberty
9256062 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development
9256063 instead of using plant branches this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out
9256064 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
9256065 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
9256066 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
9256067 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
9256068 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
9256069 the last thing on earth we need is to have tobacco added to that list
9256070 they dont have expertise in tobacco and heaven knows they dont have the funding to do what theyre doing now
9256071 this is a back door way of simply shutting down the industry entirely
9256072 i dont think fda has the staff to do tobacco regulation at this point in time
9256073 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
9256074 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9256075 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
9256076 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
9256077 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
9256078 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9256079 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
9256080 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
9256081 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9256082 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9256083 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9256084 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9256085 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9256086 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9256087 one elephant was 86 years old and had no teeth so she got her watermelon peeled
9256088 its big enough to support what were trying at least we have lower start up costs
9256089 and theres a network of 25 farms within a 60 mile radius and the peorias farmers market sets up right in front of my doorstep
9256090 pork belly why in the heck would any dag nabbed fool pay 20 for pork belly
9256091 waiter rant thanks for the tip confessions of a cynical waiter
9256092 i prefer after tax because it helps our tip which helps us pay our own taxes i tip after the tax
9256093 it is cold i guess we are guilty of some corporate speak when i see a customer glaze over i pretend to pull a string out of my neck or something to make it more personal on my side though the customer has their really annoying lines too i never want to hear that you are a good friend of the owner
9256094 nowhere it tells me youre out of your league the owner would have taken care of you by this point but i hear it
9256095 the whole foodies thing is irritating because its no longer about the taste with these no longer a steak but a black angus coated with a clarified butter made by trappist monks know what its just a steak
9256096 if youre going to be late for your reservation please call
9256097 never say do you know who i am why did you forget who you are
9256098 do not snap your fingers to get the waiters attention remember we have shears that cut through bone in the kitchen
9256099 50 ways to tell youre working in a bad restaurant
9256100 management hires you the moment you say im looking for a job
9256101 there arent enough teaspoons so you hoard them in your apron in order to have enough to do dessert service
9256102 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9256103 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9256104 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9256105 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9256106 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9256107 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9256108 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9256109 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9256110 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9256111 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont increase base airfares
9256112 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9256113 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9256114 the state made the correct decision in denying novants application
9256115 the equipment proposed by novant already is available in king and is underutilized
9256116 there is enough demand for imaging services in stokes county
9256117 we believe stokes county physicians and residents deserve to have the best possible imaging care available in their community
9256118 this level of care is not being offered by wake forest university baptist medical center in stokes
9256119 however now that our davie county hospital has been approved the state must take this into consideration when they decide the need for another hospital
9256120 it would be no different than the state taking into consideration the existence of hugh chatham hospital in elkin if we were proposing a hospital three miles away
9256121 the question becomes with the increased capacity that exists or will exist with the davie county hospital replacement in advance is there still a need for a hospital in clemmons
9256122 thats the grand canyon they drive off of in the end
9256123 once to see what would happen then they cleaned it up and did it again and cleaned it all up and left
9256124 until they made a mesopotamia in america between the valleys of the green river and the middle snake
9256125 rule no 1 dont panic rule no 2 hold on
9256126 fletch youve got to row now thats brian out there
9256127 we had boats run every hole except the marker we had a boat on little niagara
9256128 we had a boat on frogs hole we had a boat on the gut it was sick
9256129 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9256130 see after all the negativity were back in first place just like that
9256131 dan he wasnt throwing that good and had no outs he is getting paid to get outs and close out games
9256132 nathan looks worse and worse the more he appears on this road trip
9256133 wow guys really when are you going to start rallying to cut nathan loose so its been a sour road trip tomorrow will come and the twins will still have the chance to claim first
9256134 we better not be in 2nd at the end of the season by one freakin loss
9256135 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
9256136 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9256137 when the issues are not with you you go with celebrities and fanfare
9256138 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
9256139 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
9256140 its going to get us through the peak of the day by using excess energy at night
9256141 makes wind a very different kind of energy than it is today
9256142 i cant take it any more whats the point of walking or cycling when you arent going anywhere
9256143 any form of aerobic activity is good for us sports like tennis badminton or football make you run this exercise pumps up the heart rate when that happens you burn fat
9256144 you have to be pre fit to play tennis because it takes a lot out of you
9256145 if you are not used to exercise and are a smoker diabetic or above the age of 40 its best to see a doctor for a cardiac evaluation before you take up any strenuous activity
9256146 the other boys called him buckie which he hated and that was may be how he came up with the name freddie to beat the bullies freddies famous overbite was caused by the presence of four extra teeth that pushed his incisors out
9256147 his band was called the hectics but everyone in the town knew them as the heretics because they were so different and extreme for the time
9256148 homosexuality exists in any school and it was certainly did in st peters at the time that freddie was a student here
9256149 when he moved to mumbai he was apparently close to a boyfriend there
9256150 his father would have been informed and im sure very disappointed the family has a very rigid background going back generations and zoroastrians completely forbid homosexuality
9256151 it was very obvious that freddie was different from the other boys
9256152 he would run around calling everyone darling and he often got over excited
9256153 at school i think he had a bit of a tough time i think he was put upon a lot in the dormitory and my mother said that his escape route was the art room and his music
9256154 for die hard queen fans from around the world st peters is a mecca and there are many that make the pilgrimage
9256155 we do get queen fans coming to the school quite regularly
9256156 a couple of years ago five czech students broke into the school at night and slept on the school playground we had always known freddie was big but it is incredible that people still come from so far just to see his old school
9256157 however students at the school are not told about the famous former student
9256158 it is a two way thing in terms of rejection he is not accepted in this school or in india because he was gay and as indians we are not yet cool with that but freddie also turned his back on his indian roots he had a problem with it and never talked about it
9256159 he did play it down a bit being indian i think it was because he felt people wouldnt equate being indian with rock and roll
9256160 freddie saw himself as persian due to his parsi roots according to his family and that he never talked about his past because he was the kind of person who always looked to the future back in panchgani freddie has faded
9256161 freddie mercury is totally dead in this school and town
9256162 ten years after he died in the same week a fire devastated the school hall where he performed i dont think it was a coincidence
9256163 villagers like her initially people were curious to see her but now they admire her sincerity and genuine efforts
9256164 however one can see fewer boards and inauguration stones bearing the name of mp jayaprada but many still look up to her as facilitator of developmental works
9256165 floods and the dearth of link roads in the interiors have always been a major problem for lakhs of villagers in rampur
9256166 we havent met her but like her because she genuinely works for deprived people
9256167 it seems like she believes more in serving people than in politics
9256168 he said she had contested the rampur elections on his invitation and succeeded to reduce the impact of the local nawab family which is politically active
9256169 like sunil dutt she is an exception among actors who became politicians she works for the needy
9256170 fifty per cent of women have their first child when they are between 28 and 32 then they either have a second baby immediately or dont have any more at all
9256171 i was working with pricewaterhousecoopers and pfizer in the us and my career was going great guns
9256172 and in any case marriage was never the priority i was in manhattan and loved being single and independent
9256173 a career and all it stands for economic independence a sense of self worth and a sense of achievement is the primary motive for women who postpone their motherhood says dr anuradha kapoor
9256174 these days a girls first priority after college is to establish herself in her career
9256175 and since it takes at least three or four years for a person to settle into and get comfortable in her field theres no thought of having a child till then
9256176 the age matters because babies are seen as life changing these days when women have many many things to do as well as raise children as every new mother realises once the bundle of joy arrives in this world life will never be the same again
9256177 i was 31 plus when i had my daughter ruhi and id planned it that way
9256178 i took two years off work to be with her while she needed me full time which meant that in terms of work i was five years behind my contemporaries when i returned to it but it is better to take a break later in your career than when you are 25 or 26 and have just started your professional life it gets very difficult to return to work when you left it so early
9256179 those are crucial years because thats when you cross over from middle management to top brass
9256180 if i had taken a break then i would have lost everything i had achieved
9256181 so isheeta had her son adarsh when she was 33 and it worked for her
9256182 once you reach a certain level and establish your credentials its easier to return after your maternity break
9256183 we had fun as a couple and also as individuals and we partied and had the greatest time before chhavie was born
9256184 so when she was born and we couldnt go out on a whim the way we had earlier i never regretted it because wed already been there and done that i was able to fully enjoy every stage of my life being single being married and carefree and also being a mother whereas my friends who had children had to be involved with them 26 7 and they did resent that at times
9256185 a baby changes a couples life and as the child grows the responsibilities increase you are never free again
9256186 but before i became a mother i lived a fulfilled life so i didnt miss anything when my babies arrived i was a chilled out mom experienced in the ways of the world
9256187 there should be no pressure on anyone to have kids they should have their children whenever they want to provided of course that the biological clock still has time and that both partners in the relationship agree on when to have a child
9256188 if i had had a baby immediately after i got married i would have had loads of issues i wouldnt have resented it perhaps but i do think things might have been difficult
9256189 this way i had time to be there for my husband and we had our share of selfish us time
9256190 i got married when i was 27 and though my parents and in laws were keen that i conceive immediately we had our first child when i was 31
9256191 the four year wait was worth it by that time both of us had enough money to bring up a child with what we thought were the best facilities
9256192 all grown up it isnt only finances that trouble parents to be when they think of having a child its also the realisation that however cool they plan to be once theyre mum and dad they will be mum and dad and that will whether they like it or not change the way they live
9256193 you may become a mother at 25 and bring up your child very well but the fact is when youre older youre able to plan better
9256194 for instance the first thing my husband and i gave each other when we learned i was pregnant was a book on pregnancy
9256195 and it helps she adds that when youre in your thirties your own parents and in laws tend not to interfere with how you bring up your child because they know that new mum and new dad are mature and self sufficient
9256196 i would have been a disaster i wouldnt have had the patience and commitment that i have now
9256197 i was quite footloose and wanted to be on the move all the time i wouldnt have taken well to being a mother then
9256198 when you are young you are so full of aggression that you tend to lose your cool easily which might even lead you to hit your child
9256199 but at this age i find i dont lose my temper fast im able to sit with my daughter and explain what i dont like about her behaviour
9256200 young mothers can be very stressed because they are new at handling so many things
9256201 theres the career the married life and the new life that the baby ushers in
9256202 this is my first anniversary without jake im going through all the firsts without him he was going to try to come home from iraq on r amp r for this day and we were supposed to go on a cruise ive been thinking about our wedding day and playing all the days out from there in my mind i wish every day would have had more i love yous and more affection and that i had spent them holding on a little tighter and a little longer i wish i could do every day all over again
9256203 i dont see why theyd just give him medicine and allow him to go back to iraq without someone following up on him
9256204 soldiers are supposed to be strong they defend us so they dont like to admit they have a problem with depression
9256205 the war and getting all our people home needs to be the number 1 thing of importance weve lost so many lives but sometimes it seems like its just another life lost each soldier that its not important to anyone else
9256206 im going to start looking for some grief counseling now that the kids will be back in school
9256207 im going to hang on as long as i can
9256208 we always said goodbye by telling each other infinity forever and one
9256209 so its quite low in the future this ratio has to go up the service sector is the one from which the government expects to get more revenue in future
9256210 but in spite of that we are hopeful that with additional revenue on service tax and some policy factors which have come the target of rs 3 20 000 crore will be achieved
9256211 the number of investors in kolkata and its suburbs is expected to increase from 20 to 30 within a year as the realty prices in kolkata are more economical compared to that of other metros including mumbai for instance an apartment in baliganj area in kolkata is priced at rs 4 000 to rs 6 000 per sq ft as compared to rs 10 000 to rs 15 000 per sq ft in posh bandra mumbai
9256212 due to inflationary trends we are now looking at speeding up development of high rise apartments in the south with a land bank of over 125 million sq the group has over 20 mn sq ft residential and commercial space currently under construction included in this are on going residential projects amounting to 18 30 mn sq ft with a total of 11 010 homes
9256213 we are looking at acquiring more land for development of high rise apartments apart from converting bungalows into high rise apartments
9256214 there has been a moderate to medium slowdown overall retail investments have shown a sharper decline than institutional investments financial institutions are finding it attractive to enter projects at reasonable valuations in the current market situation retail investors in residential property probably need to wait and watch till after diwali to get good value
9256215 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9256216 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too that was the biggest win for me
9256217 but ive had over a week to think about it
9256218 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9256219 trying different kinds of shots too trying to add some variety
9256220 ive picked a guy who knows where all the bodies are buried where all the waste is
9256221 i woke up this morning and realized that the most significant aspect of the palin pick isnt palin we really dont know all that much about her yet but the process by which she was selected
9256222 but she may turn out to be a invigorating public presence
9256223 the palin pick reflects the most dangerous tendencies in mccains foriegn policy the tendency to react to overreact to crises without thinking it through
9256224 any idea that is formulate in a school should never be expunged from the lesson plan doing so only shows the ignorance of our society but what should we expect from a male dominated society
9256225 folks are saying she looks like tina fey etc actually she looks and sounds like peggy on king of the hill
9256226 it should be noted that when walter mondale picked geraldine ferraro in 1984 house speaker tip oneill who had worked with ferraro was not only vouching for her but raving about her
9256227 its the only form of apparel which even when dirty looks stylish
9256228 consumers today live in a seamless space that connects them to their friends across the globe and are expressive the way they want to be hence the choices they make are global and could depend on their mood we are lucky that we have a product which entertains everyones whims and fancies all in style
9256229 denim production in india in 2006 was estimated to be at 400 million metres of which 250 million metres was for domestic consumption and rest for exports
9256230 with customers spoilt for choice and brands contemplating smarter denim is not restricted to a rugged pair one drags down to college it is part of ones friday dressing today jeans are much more than a five pocketed apparel
9256231 what one sees is a john abraham or a kangana ranaut selling the new fit rather than a michael schumacher suggesting how functional and comfortable it is
9256232 thats a reason i think premium brands that are now venturing the space would make a difference at least their product would be classy thought over and deliver the real comfortable product one is actually looking for
9256233 there was a time when one wanted to be a rebel a hard guy at work and life and so came the denim today people want to move with the flow and thats what has reduced denim to something which the other has
9256234 not entirely as much ideas come from the same trend forecasting fairs with one bumping into colleagues working on the denim at a levis or a pepe however everyone prefers to bring in ones brand ethos and play it up like we will be doing something with leather this time
9256235 the term carbon footprint is used to describe the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere each year by a person household building organisation or company
9256236 for individuals about 40 of our carbon emissions come from our homes
9256237 significantly reducing your carbon footprint usually requires a dramatic lifestyle change
9256238 people have to decide how important it is for them to contribute to the solution
9256239 my name is towner whitney no thats not exactly true my real first name is sophya never believe me i lie all the time i am a crazy woman that last part is true
9256240 i have left the black sea my skin golden and salty and my hair tangled brighter from the sun to take the train that crosses the land by the violet blue sea and the sunflower fields near bucharest then cuts through mountains into resin pungent forest
9256241 eric hosmer was dragged into the process by mr boras not the pirates
9256242 the pirates feel badly that kansas citys agreement with hosmer is now subject to the legal proceeding initiated by mr boras but that is a necessary consequence of mr boras actions and he knew when he asked the union to file a grievance in an effort to renegotiate alvarezs contract that he was putting hosmers contract at risk
9256243 keep that authority precedent in mind when trying to think through the alvarez situation the union carefully worded its statement to clarify that the grievance was not filed for any one player
9256244 sometimes it takes just one bat coming out of the lineup well we took out two big ones we understood that at the time but we hoped things would carry over better than they have
9256245 theyre young and you dont expect those guys to fill those holes right away
9256246 right now i dont know what to say except that this is extremely frustrating
9256247 no not when youre throwing pitches right over the middle all night i know theyre a good hitting team but i dont care who youre facing when youre making pathetic pitches theyre going to hit them bottom line we needed a win and i didnt get it for us
9256248 you work so hard and you go through a stretch like this and hear a lot of told you so or there they go again or theyre about to break the major league record
9256249 the burden of losing for the past 15 years is not on these guys
9256250 i know it will be presented that way by a lot of people but weve been saying this all along we know where we want to go and we think were close i know a lot of people dont think that but we do well keep working
9256251 reflects the bare minimum that could be done for a former president
9256252 you cant give him a podium because people will draw the conclusion
9256253 i wouldnt let him within 100 miles of the convention center because it would be used by an unscrupulous republican party that doesnt care about the truth in character assassination against our candidate
9256254 i was wider than i wanted to be i had to make a little longer run than i wanted to and he was there for me
9256255 hes a consummate professional now and he showed on the racetrack what kind of horse he is
9256256 i was a little concerned at about the seven eighths pole
9256257 but about halfway down the backstretch you could tell that robby was comfortable with him the mystique of saratoga the graveyard of champions all that works on your head leading into this
9256258 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9256259 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9256260 im leaving this boy behind how will he ever get ahead in the global economy
9256261 but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
9256262 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
9256263 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
9256264 thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
9256265 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 percent for
9256266 all i can do is give 100 percent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
9256267 this is a club on the way up and things have got better and better every season since i was last here
9256268 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9256269 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9256270 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9256271 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9256272 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9256273 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9256274 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9256275 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9256276 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9256277 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9256278 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9256279 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9256280 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9256281 this is where people are writing us off we understand that
9256282 these young players have fought all year i am just so proud of them last year at this time we were already looking at the draft lotteries and all that type of stuff now we are in the playoff mix
9256283 making an impact whether its defensively getting a stop or getting a rebound getting other people involved pumping each other up i think thats what it is its not just about scoring points its about making an impact on the game
9256284 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9256285 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9256286 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9256287 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out
9256288 i was a little nervous but you should be my teammates helped me
9256289 its embarrassing to lose 43 0 in front of friends and family
9256290 it is analysis that strikes me as having borne no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched
9256291 the media in general and msnbc in particular are so far into the tank for barack obama that even the far left bill maher on his hbo show friday night recognized there is a problem
9256292 in 1992 we elected the hitherto little known outside the democratic party at least governor of a backward state to the presidency how do you think that turned out
9256293 quippy do you live in a cave do you ever turn on a television set or go to the movies
9256294 hey shes been right up there next to russia for a couple of years now
9256295 i cant claim a bill clinton and say that i never inhaled
9256296 shell also make everyone clean their rooms and pick up their dirty socks
9256297 i really dont know what that money threshold is but i know its a lot closer than it used to be
9256298 if i didnt have a daytime job i would have quit a while ago
9256299 its almost worse than having a gambling ad diction because of the low odds of making a decent profit these days
9256300 we will work through it though we will lose some livestock producers along the way
9256301 if we lose very many family farms well end up importing food the way we import oil
9256302 america has the highest food safety standards in the world yet we already import food from countries with less stringent food safety rules
9256303 that same square bale was running 1 50 to 2 three years ago
9256304 im also selling round bales for 20 each now with about 45 bales left of the 600 i got from the first cutting
9256305 ill have to go to 40 for a round bale this winter because my second cutting wont yield as much hay and i have to cover my production costs
9256306 you have to be a very savvy business person and have a good amount of lady luck on your side to make it work
9256307 in this age of more consumer awareness of what theyre eating people like the way that we handle our business from birth to the dinner plate
9256308 the cows are free of hormones and antibiotics and they are feed all natural products
9256309 for the older consumer our beef reminds them of the beef and steak they ate as they grew up
9256310 definitely feeling the pinch of the higher fuel and corn costs
9256311 weve seen very little if any increase from the higher costs come back to us
9256312 is allowing us to stay more competitive but the lack of clarity on future material costs is concerning
9256313 weve had to learn to become more efficient in how we do business and weve done without some things like we havent bought a new truck for the farm since 1997
9256314 some of the trucks have more than 200 000 miles on them but they are still running
9256315 our loan payments are based on the flock were growing
9256316 its getting to the point where you cant sell a chicken farm these days you can give it away but selling doesnt make a lot of sense given the loans the typical chicken farmer has
9256317 im sure youre going to see some farmers put as many chickens into as few houses as possible as one way to reduce their fuel costs
9256318 we need some kind of subsidy for these high fuel costs and help with better insulating the chicken houses
9256319 the people in washington are no help were asking for tax credits on the gas prices and theyre offering us more loans to pile on top of the loans were already trying to pay off
9256320 and theyll have to get used to it eventually food producing companies are going to make a profit or theyre going to be out of business
9256321 when you lose the small cattle farmer the supply of meat will go down
9256322 the big producers will reduce the supply until they can charge enough to make it more profitable for them
9256323 no one can say that the ongoing process of displaying marathi signboards is because of him the mns has nothing to do with it
9256324 we at the bmc invoked the law and i would like to congratulate municipal commissioner jairaj phatak for doing so
9256325 this all started because we asked our customers what they about our stores and what they didnt like
9256326 i was watching the ball i tried to clear it and was about to hit the ball when the guy stuck his foot in front of me and i hit him i was like great i gave them a pk and they havent even done anything this entire half
9256327 luckily our keeper saved it he said he had studied the guy who took the pk
9256328 we have a new coach so the media knows they have to be a little patient
9256329 once he gets a couple of games theyll start demanding more
9256330 the team did well but it didnt go the way we wanted we didnt mark carlos bocanegra on the goal and paid the consequences
9256331 in that game we felt patrick nyarko needed to be up front combined with brian mcbride
9256332 but we would like to see him have more of an impact on the attack
9256333 you might want to hold onto this rough draft as a souvenir
9256334 because youre never going to see a soccer article this long in the paper
9256335 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9256336 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9256337 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9256338 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9256339 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9256340 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9256341 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9256342 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9256343 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9256344 i will exercise my right to franchise during the coming lok sabha elections only to support him his contribution in this area in the past one decade has been immense vinod khanna is a real life hero for me
9256345 gurdaspur residents were used to not marry their daughters to boys from hoshiarpur district because the places were not connected by roads business or social ties could not flourish since independence as there was no bridge at shawala pattan village leading to hoshiarpur boats were the only transportation and life would be miserable during heavy rains
9256346 another bridge connecting local areas taragarh and narot jaimal singh was also built because of his efforts he gave a lifeline to gurdaspur
9256347 earlier residents of narot jaimal singh and adjoining areas used to hire boats to cross over the beas river to reach gurdaspur via taragarh more than 60 per cent residents of narot jaimal singh would have not visited gurdaspur till the bridge came up
9256348 khanna doesnt have any office in gurdaspur but after all he is a national leader i contact the local municipal councillor or mla for my daily works
9256349 he rarely frequents the villages in gurdaspur he should set up his offices in various parts of the constituency so that villagers can submit their complaints
9256350 the nabard has approved the bridge project and work will start soon
9256351 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9256352 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9256353 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9256354 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9256355 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9256356 both starting pitchers did a great job both bullpens struggled and both teams used offense late to make a game of it
9256357 given the position of these two teams in the standings thats saying something
9256358 i threw a couple of breaking balls then came back with fastballs
9256359 the truth is this is the worst year of my career from a team point of view or a personal one
9256360 the most frustrating and the most disappointing from a team standpoint we had such high expectations and the year has been a disaster
9256361 they say the game will drive you crazy if you let it and im pretty close
9256362 in may i had the worst month of my career i was absolutely brutal and theres no other way to say it
9256363 but ive come out of seven eight games with a lead and gotten no decision this season thats hard to swallow too
9256364 i liked her daring her arrogance and i mean that in a good way
9256365 when we played chicago you saw guys you never heard of getting open and making good plays our second group was going against their best defense and doing what they wanted to them
9256366 it would take us a whole half to cross the 50 yard line
9256367 you saw in the past with your own eyes what his offense could do
9256368 weve got a new leader on the ship when he stands up in the room you know he knows what hes talking about everythings going to change this year
9256369 no matter what you have done in this league he makes you feel like you still have to prove yourself
9256370 if i mess up hes going to get on me thats what i like about him he treats everybody the same
9256371 hes what we thought hed be and more he doesnt make mental errors hes the kind of player to build an offense around
9256372 they can both catch the ball and theyre outstanding runners but theyre just different frank is a more physical and powerful back inside and marshall is very elusive
9256373 after practice id look at my phone and wouldnt see a phone call from her ill never get over it but im getting better
9256374 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9256375 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9256376 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling
9256377 if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason
9256378 i didnt count ashley out until last nights game was over
9256379 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
9256380 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
9256381 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
9256382 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
9256383 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
9256384 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix
9256385 you make me want to be a man junior jack mix
9256386 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
9256387 sometimes people lose sight of what was the real purpose because they want to put other issues on top of it
9256388 in the beginning they would just shoot themselves later they started making films
9256389 after the cspsa was passed i knew it would be difficult to make films
9256390 heavy metals were found in 20 7 per cent of the medicines with toxicity being a higher 21 7 per cent in us made products as compared with 19 5 per cent in indian ones
9256391 the trouble is that ayurvedic formulations are often not sold in the drugs category but in the food products food supplement category since the safety standards of ingredients are different in the food and drug category the department of ayush under the health ministry has set permissible standards for potentially harmful ingredients in ayurvedic drugs
9256392 these are traditional formulations that have been in use for centuries and cannot be changed at will millions of people have used these drugs safely and benefited from them what we need to do now is to test these drugs using modern scientific methods and re establish their safety and effectiveness
9256393 assuming that traditional medicine is safe is wrong they may cause side effects and should be taken on prescription
9256394 we want to make traditional drugs as safe as their allopathic counterparts that undergo safety and efficacy trials before getting approved for use
9256395 the relief material is slowly coming in but its coming
9256396 this time there are only two choppers last august there were 12 and 8230
9256397 people make crores in the name of floods the most expensive music systems and lcds are sent to top bureaucrats once the noise dies down when the waters recede it is the time for ngos to get into the aid racket
9256398 if you see the flood area count the districts consider the population and count the food packets youll understand the percentage of people who actually get help
9256399 if the water had come in the morning it would have been better i would have been able to save my family
9256400 but it rose at night didnt cm saab say we had to run for our lives
9256401 come for us only when the water is neck deep they said
9256402 the boats are not going into the interiors when we offer to go along they say we are only thinking of our families while they are thinking of saving entire villages how will that help my father and grandfather
9256403 how do i know about your child lets make you dm for a day and then see and 8230
9256404 troopers eventually investigated 13 issues and found four in which wooten violated policy or broke the law or both
9256405 a palmer alaska state trooper to whom her sister was involved in a bitter child custody battle
9256406 a palmer alaska state trooper to whom her sister was involved in a bitter child custody battle
9256407 most of the books im required to teach you are too difficult for you to understand so were going to watch a lot of videos and well read some excerpts of the books to get the language
9256408 he has been involved with all the conflict of interests and self dealing related to the companys financial situation and his fingerprints are all over the cookie jar
9256409 i think it has a great long term future i didnt want to see it go into bankruptcy
9256410 i did a deal that nobody else was willing to do if anybody else had wanted to do a deal on those terms it was offered to them and they turned it down
9256411 carl is very smart and acts very aggressively in his own self interest
9256412 and if you get in the way of his self interest he will trample you
9256413 about our culture and whereve weve been in history his story deserves to be told
9256414 i think its just fantastic because hes lewis is a fantastic individual
9256415 i got as much fun out of covering the thomasville bulldogs as i did the washington redskins
9256416 the closer i got to them the bigger the smiles got
9256417 the education and inspiration is there because of my family
9256418 london still remains a favourite among indian investors followed by the banks of the river thames
9256419 going green used to be part of just a handful of organisations mission statements but now its become part of everyones agenda
9256420 that has of course increased the need for sustainability consultants
9256421 there have been some examples of consultants who charge a lot of money to churn paper without results
9256422 but if youre serious about sustainability third party certification like leed is part of the deal otherwise its like saying i want to get fit but i dont want to get on the scale
9256423 just because leed gives a point for something doesnt mean its the right thing to do environmentally
9256424 is that the best thing to do in a hot dry climate where there is a water shortage
9256425 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today we continue to assess the situation closely
9256426 this speed of response is essential if the service is to achieve its objective of becoming truly self sustaining with the technology remaining much the same telephone we are making it more accessible informed and quick
9256427 all this started in the late 60s when at amp t figured out how to develop toll free numbers and a billing mechanism to charge the owner of the toll free number it monopolised this business until its entire telephone business was broken down by the government in 1984 in a landmark anti trust ruling in america you can order flowers through 1 800 flowers or check phone numbers and local businesses through 1 800 yellowpages the alphabets translate to numbers on the telephone keypad
9256428 this simple but unique tool still gathers a lot of attention in the us but seems to have not gained any traction in india
9256429 toll free numbers have not taken off here compared to the overall telecom revolution some of the advertised telephone numbers which may or may not be toll free are primarily restricted to television and reality shows

9256439 considering the large base of the industry this growth rate has been encouraging and a little above our estimated projection the report projects the indian e amp m industry to grow by 18 cumulatively over the next five years and cross the trillion mark by 2012
9256440 there is increasing interest within this sector currently and activity is building up as well jp morgan and icici ventures have invested in pvr pictures and more such deals maybe seen in the future the other style of investing within this sector is so far project specific where one may draw a comparison to the real estate sector while company specific investments are not too many yet more investments are made via spvs since there are not too many companies within the cinema sector regular pe funds have so far stayed away though certain deals like temasek investing into ies media and de shaw who have invested in amar ujala publications have occurred the entertainment and media world as a whole is being looked at as an investment option currently as far as large investments go
9256441 investing in such vehicles which pretty much guarantee your investment returned and whatever else you make over and above that is based on movie selection marketing and success are the type of products that investors these days have an eye out for
9256442 we have signed a deal with big entertainment for six movies the first of which is just releasing this is a very noteworthy move within the cinema industry and hopefully this will lead to more interest in bollywood from the corporate world having the financial backing of reliance is always a boost and if our movies do as well as we hope the industry too will benefit as a whole
9256443 the cinema industry is growing rapidly it is currently growing at the rate of 13 or 14 and is expected to hit 15 and beyond soon multiplexes have been one of the driving forces for the same as they have changed the way cinema is being viewed these days fewer people are opting for stand alone theatres with multiplexes redefining the way cinema is viewed especially in urban india
9256444 with more money being pumped into the industry through pe public fund raising private investors and corporate organisations the industry is bound to grow there will be more movies made each year more revenues generated and an overall increase in growth in india movies and cricket are followed like a religion in the film world our local industry is one of the strongest with us making more movies then most other countries across the globe
9256445 over the next 3 to 4 years revenues will cross that of most other nations which create cinema barring hollywood due to the purchasing power parity there in the next 5 years i am sure the indian film industry will be amongst the top three revenue generating film industries in the world
9256446 the emerging investment avenues for people to invest in this industry and for the industry itself are very good for us

9256448 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9256449 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9256450 as much as you can expect in an opening game like this
9256451 it was a great feeling in front of 110 000 fans ill never do that again
9256452 when you first start you want everything to go right
9256453 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9256454 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9256455 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9256456 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9256457 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9256458 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9256459 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9256460 i moved when i needed to and was really happy out there
9256461 this is a good photo but its a little dull
9256462 the immediate goal is to make sure there are more people on private insurance plans i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9256463 emergency physicians can and do perform miracles every day but taking on the full time medical care for 46 million uninsured americans is one miracle even we cannot perform access to care in the emergency department is no substitute for the comprehensive healthcare reform policy that should be at the heart of the platform of any presidential campaign

9256468 but ive had over a week to think about it so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9256469 i would have loved it if we could have met in the final
9256470 my biggest worry is that shes so good sorry but im thinking about how im going to get past her
9256471 shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best its nice to feel like when youre playing your best
9256472 right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9256473 i have a very good feeling about the next round i saw serena play against her i dont know how to say her first name too well
9256474 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9256475 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9256476 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9256477 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9256478 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9256479 to have the opportunity to come over here and play in a 70 000 seat nfl stadium great city where the fan base was pretty much even to play a bcs team what a great way to open the season
9256480 do i feel i played good 90 percent of the time yeah
9256481 but a senior quarterbacks got to play good 100 percent of the time
9256482 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9256483 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9256484 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9256485 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9256486 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9256487 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9256488 its still early we still got a long way to go
9256489 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9256490 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9256491 our fans didnt deserve the kind of effort we put out thursday
9256492 were not only battling for fourth place were also battling to move up to third or second
9256493 we played with an aggressive tenacity we havent had in a long time
9256494 we have to go out and control our own destiny
9256495 they have talked to me about the 4 4 game not the league cup one mistake in the last two minutes meant they lost the
9256496 they also told me they respected some of the tottenham players and at this moment it is important for tottenham not to lose another game
9256497 they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this we need to respect them even more
9256498 if you win a derby it is fantastic when i arrived here some people said to me you need to win three derbies tottenham fulham and west ham
9256499 tottenham thought they would have a better start to the season than they have done because they have lost both games
9256500 but i know juande and the players at tottenham they made one or two mistakes in the games before ours but we need to remember this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby
9256501 at the momemt we owe something to our fans but we can and we must give a lot more and thats what we are working on
9256502 the team have to improve we need to be ambitious and keep our concentration for the full 90 minutes
9256503 we are more concerned with the errors we have made in the last few games rather than obsessing about achieving our first victory
9256504 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9256505 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9256506 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9256507 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9256508 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9256509 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9256510 health care as eminent domain the myth of a market solution
9256511 if the shield had failed fx would have quickly exited the scripted original series business
9256512 hes a man plagued by regret and the fallout of his actions starting pretty much from day one of the series
9256513 hes definitely become a guy that understands there is a tremendous consequence not just for himself but for everyone around him for the decisions that hes made but you cant change the spots on a leopard hes in the vortex and hes swimming
9256514 its a very collaborative show so we came up with a plan for this final season that we thought worked really well then we came up with a better idea so we changed the plan and thats always been the way that this show has worked best
9256515 go to hollywood and take the drive to north avenue were going to santullos
9256516 id just as soon not go through it again to be honest with you
9256517 its a job where you are always second to a dog
9256518 its a testament to our offensive line a lot of times we got to the second level without being touched this is what we were looking for and its what we got today
9256519 it feels good and exciting to get back out there
9256520 i think we are headed in the right direction and this is going to be a great season for our football team
9256521 i am really pleased i think our defense is much improved from last season and they tackled really well at times today but youve got to understand that we are outweighed up front by 30 to 40 pounds in every position
9256522 it was sad and i went in there and saw him at halftime
9256523 hell probably be stronger next year and hell be in better condition if in fact he has to go through that type of rehab
9256524 can you expect that from us i dont know theres some guys that when they touch the ball and if you make a mistake they can score on you fun to watch
9256525 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations
9256526 we have a little thing coach says in practice you put the money in the bank in games you get to take it out today was payday for us i knew we were going to come out do some big stuff i just got paid today
9256527 a key for us today was getting out there and using all those weapons

9256530 of course not why would you say something like that
9256531 a damnable lie a black infernal creation of a twisted distorted mind
9256532 obscene in the extreme the burning and banning of john steinbecks the grapes of wrath

9256537 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
9256538 i remember last time in new york i hit him and he did that little fake charge thing and he ended up running to first
9256539 i guess he got upset tonight i hit him again and he started talking i hit him with two strikes i actually did him a favor you know i guess he was upset he called me the p word i told him i was right here he just kept talking
9256540 ich habs auf der ifa gesehen und war begeistert ich hols mir
9256541 hallo wei jemand zuf llig wer den duschkopf designt hat mag das ding kaufen
9256542 was f r ein mist und vor allem zu solch einem preis
9256543 f rs ohr war ja klar dass das fr her oder sp ter kommen mu te ohrringe im
9256544 faldo would have soaked it up if he was here which of course he was not
9256545 and you know moehlers going to battle he ended up pitching a great game for us you know hes a gutsy guy and hes aggressive and going to give us a chance we just had to get some runs for him
9256546 im an old man and i saw it with my natural eyes he blew it and he refused to get help thats the thing that upset me he said he saw it as no catch
9256547 that took a run off the board for us and probably at least a double away from a kid whos scratching for hits
9256548 i knew it short hopped me and i popped up like i caught it i knew it was a short hop i also knew it was a tough one it was up to the umpire and it was a tough call for him to make
9256549 thats not his game or anybodys game and he got it up and got nailed
9256550 basically the guys put three runs on the board for me and if i did my job we would have had a good chance to win the game
9256551 i just had to make an adjustment and get the ball down i kept trying to pound the strike zone and get ahead and i was just missing a lot and falling behind when you do that theyre going to make you pay
9256552 you always want to contribute and sometimes regardless if you win or lose just going out there and throwing quality innings up there gives your team a chance
9256553 for whatever reason thats where the streak has come from
9256554 he was changing speeds spotting the ball well on the attack hes throwing good
9256555 any time youre going to have success its going to be because you got good starting pitching and your defense is good
9256556 any time youre part of something thats a first especially since im a big brewers fanatic an honor to have that title
9256557 hes done a phenomenal job all year and youve got to figure that at some point hes going to hit a bump in the road because everyone does
9256558 when you throw the ball down the middle i dont care who youre playing its not going to get major league hitters out
9256559 for the first few innings every time i tried to pitch inside it was right down the middle camerons home run was right down the middle sure theyre a good hitting team but when you throw pathetic pitches it really doesnt work
9256560 i was just trying to put my glove on it and do anything to prevent it from getting by me
9256561 i didnt ever feel like we had a chance to turn it i gave it a shot at first and we got him
9256562 he made an unbelievable play i dont know how he made that play let alone get two outs on it
9256563 i think he might have been just a little too far away to do a shovel pass
9256564 it was a little low but thats a play hes made many times before
9256565 we need to win some games and maybe spoil some people
9256566 its nice to do some good things and get a win out of it
9256567 you dont want to hurt them but if we need them we need them
9256568 its real disappointing but that was a game we needed to win
9256569 thats an unfortunate loss for us because thats a game we have to win
9256570 i looked up and i knew the third baseman wasnt going to get it so right when i hit home i turned around hoping he was charging right behind me
9256571 it wasnt a bad bunt and bobby can run a little bit too
9256572 it would have taken a perfect throw in a perfect spot to get him i was kind of shocked by it
9256573 joes a very good athlete and a very good fielder
9256574 he could have made that play you miss one play in a game and its a tough loss its not an easy throw
9256575 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9256576 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9256577 after looking at the way things are on this earth heres what ive decided is the best way to live take care of yourself have a good time and make the most of whatever job you have for as long as god gives you life and thats about it thats the human lot yes we should make the most of what god gives both the bounty and the capacity to enjoy it accepting whats given and delighting in the work its gods gift god deals out joy in the present the now its useless to brood over how long we might live
9256578 i have seen all the things that are done under the sun all of them are meaningless a chasing after the wind
9256579 are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
9256580 those who have been stealing must steal no longer but must work doing something useful with their own hands that they may have something to share with those in need
9256581 each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of gods grace in its various forms
9256582 whatever you do work at it with all your heart as working for the lord not for human masters since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the lord as a reward it is the lord christ you are serving
9256583 faldo would have soaked it up if he was here which of course he was not
9256584 such nonsense represents nothing short of blatant and specific racism
9256585 to me the whole thing is a bit odd in that i cant think of too many players korean or not to whom this would apply after two years on tour 99 per cent of the players know enough english to get by which begs the question why is the lpga bothering
9256586 in most cases i have found that the players can understand english but they are less comfortable speaking it in a public forum that is understandable its easy to get something wrong in a second language the bottom line is that the lpga has more important issues it could be focusing on
9256587 today was a celebration for us here at the flint hills job corp
9256588 when you all have unity no one can stop you and thats what weve done weve come together to watch those young people walk across the stage
9256589 until that big gust of wind just blew in the door
9256590 i think i stayed up two nights helping with no sleep at all
9256591 i woke up one day and just said i was gonna go to job vorps and move and start a whole new life
9256592 to overcome it is like superhero like im a superhero

9256600 he came on and got a good tackle in on nasri a very good tackle
9256601 then the guy just sliced him down as he was running through write it any way you want but if you write any different you are deceiving your readers
9256602 it was a true draw we did not deserve to win
9256603 you do everything with the ball at your feet its very beautiful
9256604 i am announcing today mandatory evacuation of new orleans starting 8am sunday 2300 sunday aest on the west bank
9256605 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9256606 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9256607 all cats are brown as this exception to the rule proves
9256608 and not to mention the shark which we wont because it doesnt fit into the category of animals without teeth
9256609 gears of war is a great franchise first and foremost for xbox 360 and therefore were focusing on that platform for gears of war 2 weve decided were not going to do a pc version this time around
9256610 lets say we are not and see how many squeal
9256611 its a great win but we wont get carried away
9256612 our important midfield players james mcarthur and alex neil didnt come out of the traps and then we didnt defend their first goal at all
9256613 their second also came from our mistake that took the wind out of our sails for a while but i thought hearts were hanging on at the end
9256614 i wouldnt say our planning for the start of this tournament is in chaos because that is not the right word
9256615 but its fair to say that when the european championship finished we were in better shape than we are going into the world cup qualifiers
9256616 when we played georgia august 20 we had players who had never met each other before let alone played together sometimes i look at other countries and think theyve got a joy ride compared to us
9256617 i dont believe in pinch hitters i think they work 20 per cent of the time weve got guys in the top eight who hit cricket shots we dont have to go aerial just play decent cricket shots
9256618 one of our jobs taking over was to get the best out of the players and i want the lads to keep expressing themselves and playing with no fear
9256619 thats the only way to be happy as a person
9256620 there is a lot of mediocrity that people settle for in county cricket
9256621 to get tres marcus trescothick back in the team would be massive but hes got his reasons etcetera and thats it
9256622 as a kid i always wanted to be the best
9256623 driving my car now i dont like losing at the lights
9256624 i took it a bit too seriously i let it affect me as a person i was really unsure about certain things and i put so much pressure on myself since taking over ive told myself to trust myself i think i tried a bit too hard
9256625 no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9256626 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it
9256627 i felt the same as i did the last time against them
9256628 you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times when you are good
9256629 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things
9256630 im on vacation i dont got nothing to lose i got one more month left you know go to the house relax and see what my situation is going to be
9256631 as far as how we pitch him were missing our location on him is what were doing right now
9256632 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9256633 the other side is the best team in the national league we play everybody hard
9256634 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm
9256635 i kind of found it and started pounding the zone with all my pitches
9256636 ive already did what i am going to do in my career
9256637 even though im not walking guys my command just isnt there
9256638 im throwing plenty of strikes but the strikes just arent as quality as theyve been in the past
9256639 we should be happy but at the same time if there was a trophy for balls the other team would have won it hands down there is one team hanging on at the end
9256640 im so pleased with the result and the way we played because out team over the last two months or so has not played well and tonight we saw more evidence of a team and obviously the quality of some of our individuals that need to perform at this stage
9256641 everybody knows that landon is a great goal scorer it is what he does it is what he has done his whole career and it is what he will carry on doing because he is very talented and if you give him the ball in the right places he will score 99 percent of the time tonight was a good night for him because he had two chances and put them both away
9256642 just a great ball from eddie i kind of got tangled up with someone and i turned around and the ball was just there im not sure how he got it there but a great ball
9256643 i was pretty much caught out in no mans land in terms of the ball broke down and he pretty much came in on a breakaway even though guys are around him and im not really where i want to be and he showed that he was coming across and as i started to move he put it to the other side
9256644 other than the fact that landon makes two unbelievable runs he is smart and he is fast and he scored two great goals it is unfortunate that we gave up two but at the same time i think we competed well we had to come back we desperately wanted to get three points but we fought back to get at least a point
9256645 i thought we showed a lot of character in the first half going down 1 0 and responding right away with two quick goals
9256646 but thats been the character of our team all season
9256647 the guys know he can make special places so we try to get him balls in the right positions
9256648 it allows him to make those plays hes been doing it for us all season the key thing is getting him into spots where he can make the difference and weve been able to do that on a pretty consistent basis this year
9256649 fc dallas were chasing the game and throwing people forward so we had to bunker in a bit
9256650 this was very disappointing it was a game i think we could have won
9256651 we had some good scoring chances we were creating some problems for columbus and we were at home
9256652 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9256653 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9256654 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9256655 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9256656 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9256657 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9256658 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9256659 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9256660 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9256661 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9256662 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9256663 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9256664 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9256665 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9256666 he was feeling tight hes a veteran he knew when to pull himself out to make sure hes available well evaluate more tomorrow
9256667 i still dont believe it unfortunately i missed two penalty kicks this year and hopefully i wont miss again
9256668 i think he just tried to hit it in the corner and put power on it
9256669 sometimes when you hit it as hard as he did you lose some of the accuracy he put a lot into the game and im sure fatigue had something to do with it
9256670 the field was a little bit wet but thats not an excuse
9256671 i dont usually power that much i put a little more spin than usual thats why the keeper didnt move it just wasnt a good penalty kick
9256672 it was important for us to withstand their opening 20 minutes or so
9256673 they come out flying once we were able to get through that time we were able to settle down and get a hold of the game for a little bit
9256674 i thought tonight was a good match all the way around i thought it was probably a great match for the fans to watch and im real happy to walk out of this place with a zero its a tough place to play
9256675 i dont think we were very good with the ball in the first half
9256676 we had to make a few adjustments i thought the game was there to take had we been better with the soccer part of it in the first half i was a little disappointed coming into the locker room because we talked a lot about possession
9256677 i thought we got better in the second half the buildup leading to the penalty was pretty good soccer unfortunately the result of the penalty didnt go our way
9256678 you run into a bit of a physical and mental beating at times
9256679 but i think the guys have done great this year i just told them its our second loss in i think two months it was a bad day all around but we cant dwell on it with so many games coming up
9256680 we definitely have a lot of tired legs including myself from the world cup qualifiers
9256681 so we need to take the rest when we get the chance and turn things around next week and definitely come up with a win
9256682 our goal is the same every game to get a clean sheet
9256683 well let the guys up front worry about how many goals to score and well just take care of things in the back
9256684 beware of he who would deny you access to information for in his mind he dreams himself your master
9256685 it was amazing the biggest challenge was to be good on the restarts
9256686 we want to be no 1 tomorrow in the sprint cup series race
9256687 i dont care about my bad rap but they dont deserve one
9256688 because this nation has not been serious about vigorously attacking pornography some believe it is appropriate to view in public
9256689 not only will the flight attendants be placed in a situation that could be considered sexual harassment passengers who openly view porn where children can see it may be violating federal harmful to minor laws
9256690 thats nicole graves shes a porn star making a little film appearance isnt that nice her pubic hair is a rainbow
9256691 all cats are brown as this exception to the rule proves
9256692 and not to mention the shark which we wont because it doesnt fit into the category of animals without teeth
9256693 getting twhirl and other adobe air apps working on ubuntu 64
9256694 they are a strong side nine of the players who played against luxembourg played against england in 2006
9256695 they prefer 3 4 3 which is a little bit different and they are competitive they beat croatia last year at home we know its going to be difficult and i think they will take points off all the teams in the group
9256696 we dont have 11 world class players but we have a squad of players who have a passion to win games and try to take the country to the world cup finals
9256697 we havent qualified for 10 years and we havent won a friendly at hampden for 12 years burley added i think the euro 2008 qualifiers gave us a bit of belief and showed there was passion so if we can enhance that and channel it in the right direction anything is possible
9256698 we had a meeting with the squad and i said do you think we can qualify how many points and we set a target of 17 points if we can get 17 points i think we can be first or second last campaign scotland averaged two points a game but it wasnt enough youve got to average more than two points a game its a tall order but its something we have got to go for
9256699 hes got a very strong left foot loves the ball to his feet and they look to play him the ball burley said
9256700 they play with three strikers pandev is the middle one the point they try and play through
9256701 but i think a lot of stuff thats been going on in the early part of the season has been exaggerated referees and linesmen make mistakes the same way as players and managers make mistakes
9256702 we are certainly getting them highlighted in a manner that is far greater than anything i can remember but if referees do make an error it is because it is an error not because they support clubs or have a bias towards this that or the next thing if we stop accepting that factor then we start to have real problems
9256703 i dont think ive met walter since the end of last season
9256704 oddly enough im supposed to play golf with him but its never been possible to do it and im sorry about that because i enjoy his company
9256705 the crowd wants the ball to be played at 100 mph but i want players to put their foot on it and i hope we have the people to do that
9256706 its nice to play at high tempo but there are other factors you have to take into account is it rainy is it windy is the pitch good
9256707 its nice to be told what to do by one so young and inexperienced
9256708 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
9256709 kevins been getting chances and keepers have been making saves so its been playing on his mind but i said to him as long as youre getting chances the goals will come
9256710 its been difficult for him as there has been so much speculation about his future weve had no contact in recent weeks about him for anyone to buy in the last couple of days of the transfer window smacks to me of a panic buy
9256711 as you can imagine i am absolutely distraught to let down sir mark prescott and the owners but it wasnt like i had a real late night and was clubbing or anything i was just out with my wife
9256712 i have taken loads of breath tests and have never registered anything other than zero and to be honest i am absolutely distraught and cant quite understand it really
9256713 like most sportsmen jockeys are unbelievably fit but unlike other sportsmen they are also incredibly light they drink and eat the absolute minimum and so having a glass or two of beer is like someone else having several pints
9256714 and marquesa is entitled to be there she won her maiden a fortnight ago and before that was second in a group three at naas to cuis ghaire who was favourite for the 1 000 guineas at the time
9256715 you told me that about anton ferdinand and hes up in sunderland having a medical
9256716 we are so proud to have mrs clinton as a client
9256717 she has true beauty and substance and is an inspiration to women everywhere her choice is also right on trend as yellow gold with colored stones is a key look for the season
9256718 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind ive been living a lie for a long time ive been hiding who i am for so long i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
9256719 im going to be calm this winter and relax with my family
9256720 i go every year but this year im not going
9256721 i want to see if after next year i can stay here
9256722 we played some great stuff and we could have had more
9256723 it is as good a performance as ive seen from a team of mine or anybodys for a 45 minute period for a long time
9256724 we controlled the whole game and created enough chances but in the end we have dropped two points
9256725 the performance by the players deserved a victory and at the moment they are all feeling very disappointed with the result
9256726 i would have preferred it if rangers had kept 11 players on the field after the sending off they got nine men behind the ball and closed all the gaps
9256727 he did not refuse to play it was my decision it is better for him to stay in madrid and wait for the situation to be resolved
9256728 i have spoken with spurs chairman daniel levy several times and wouldnt be surprised if they go higher
9256729 valencia are the other club interested but id say there is a good chance andrei will be a spurs player come tuesday

9256800 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9256801 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9256802 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9256803 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9256804 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9256805 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9256806 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9256807 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9256808 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent

9256838 it is time for malaysians to rediscover the real meaning of freedom in the country
9256839 efforts by certain parties to destabilize the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
9256840 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will adversely affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets i will not allow these disturbances to continue
9256841 our leaders have let us down by indulging in too much politicking and polarization in our multiracial and multi religious society
9256842 this is a full privatization of austrian airlines while making sure that there is an austrian core shareholder who will keep the vetoing minority of 25 per cent
9256843 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time

9256848 we are not a popular mainstream club that can impose a cover charge and expect people to show up it will never work

9256850 it was time to expand somewhere else to draw younger patrons but i also wanted a better mix of clientele as my first outlet attracts mostly those in their 40s
9256851 when i first opened thailand disco i encountered many fights at my club we were also slapped with demerit points by the licensing authorities because the performers interacted with customers now when the club nears full capacity we advise people to come back another day

9256882 i thought he played pretty good in the first half
9256883 i dont know when he hurt his thumb whether it was the first half or the second i dont think he said anything to us in the first half about it
9256884 its like anything else you cant just make a decision that play is going to be open and then they pick that off then we got a break on the other interception he kind of just threw that up and the guy caught the ball that ended up being just as good as a punt i know he can play better than he did in the second half

9256886 overall assessments of health may be an important measure for different reasons than more specific and detailed measurements it is a holistic approach as opposed to a specific approach
9256887 our analysis actually states that social capital affluence and risk taking all influence health but these things do not work together
9256888 noaa is looking forward to taking a significant step in our efforts to protect right whales
9256889 our scientific analysis shows that a 10 knot speed limit in critical areas will significantly reduce the threat to these endangered marine mammals
9256890 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
9256891 the preferred alternative is a balanced approach grounded in science that would significantly enhance our ability to protect right whales but it would also take into account concerns about the safety of ship crews and the impact on an important segment of our economy
9256892 everything else being equal if you are happy and satisfied with your life now you are more likely to be healthy in the future importantly our results are independent of several factors that impact on health such as smoking physical activity alcohol consumption and age
9256893 during the past four weeks have you been a happy person
9256894 all things considered how satisfied are you with your life
9256895 we found strong evidence that both happiness and life satisfaction have an effect on our indicators of health
9256896 there are indications that as you become happier and more satisfied with your life you tend to become healthier as well
9256897 their unique contribution is the short three year time period of their study
9256898 to my knowledge this the shortest time ive seen where looking at baseline happiness predicts future health it is compelling to me that measuring someones happiness now accounts for some differences in physical health in as little as three years
9256899 the cayman trough may be a lost world that will give us the missing piece in a global puzzle of deep sea life
9256900 the deep ocean is the largest ecosystem on our planet so we need to understand its patterns of life
9256901 deep sea exploration has also given us new cancer treatments and better fibre optic cables for the internet both thanks to deep sea creatures
9256902 these undersea volcanoes lie within british seabed territory recognised by the united nations
9256903 because our fabrication technique is independent of the geometrical arrangement of the nanowires on the substrate we envision further combining the process with one of the several methods already developed for the controlled placement and alignment of nanowires over large areas
9256904 we believe the marriage of these processes will soon provide the necessary control to enable integrated nanowire photonic circuits in a standard manufacturing setting
9256905 such an advance could lead to the development of a completely new class of integrated circuits such as large arrays of ultra small nanoscale lasers that could be designed as high density optical interconnects or be used for on chip chemical sensing
9256906 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
9256907 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
9256908 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
9256909 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country
9256910 it is a shame no country could be given a satisfactory total score
9256911 the baltic sea is influenced by a multitude of human activities regulated by a patchwork of international and national regulations and authorities
9256912 what the baltic sea needs now is political leadership that can look beyond national or sectoral interests and take an integrated approach to solving the problems
9256913 her persistent efforts to unite groups and encourage cross border discussions on the future of the baltic sea
9256914 we now have an opportunity in the area of sea use management with two current processes on the european level
9256915 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
9256916 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
9256917 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
9256918 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing
9256919 understanding and mitigating vulnerable bycatch in southern african trawl and longline fisheries
9256920 the findings help accurately identify management measures to reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting other vulnerable marine life like turtles and sharks
9256921 while this information is valuable its crucial that it translates into compliance with mitigation measures on the part of fishing operations
9256922 this has management implications for seabirds because of the dramatic changes in marine ecosystems as a result of past fishing activities
9256923 the possibility exists that management actions could place a further burden on these species
9256924 albatrosses and petrels undertake amazing journeys where many species frequently circumnavigate the globe crossing many national and international jurisdictions as well as coming across numerous fishing fleets from various nations
9256925 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our oceans
9256926 in this first stage what democracy has brought is just an exchange of power among political parties nothing has been done and we cannot remain silent any longer
9256927 well im southern baptist and thats the way we believe or its better than
9256928 you perceive the world with particular attention to nature you focus on the hidden treasures of life the background and how that is affected by the details of life you are also particularly drawn towards the colors around you because of the value you place on nature you tend to find comfort in more subdued settings and find energy in solitude you like to ponder ideas and imagine the many possibilities of your life without worrying about the details or specifics you are highly focused on specific goals or tasks and find meaning in life by pursuing those goals you are a down to earth person who enjoys going with the flow

9256936 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
9256937 more than 50 per cent of the active female population contribute to the economy of their country
9256938 the problem is that this contribution is still mainly in the informal sector
9256939 the challenge cambodian women face is not just to access employment but decent better paying employment
9256940 positive trends towards greater equality include increasing girls enrolment in primary education and resulting rises in female literacy and expanded employment opportunities
9256941 if textiles goes youll have 300 000 people employed today on the road tomorrow not to mention supporting businesses large and small including mine that would also be in trouble
9256942 the attitude is very much let foreign businesses come and do it but no work has been done on paving the way and targeting what investment they want
9256943 to raise their participation in formal employment and decision making institutions women need skills and information about how markets and the law function
9256944 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
9256945 are you talking about the informal sector where women are already heavily represented or 8am to 5pm professional jobs
9256946 we are not going to increase womens participation in professional jobs until we have things like adequate child care facilities care for older people and salaries that keep up with the cost of living
9256947 in order to participate in economic activity and contribute to the economy you have to be healthy
9256948 the high rate of maternal mortality while declining is a real concern and a real challenge we need to look at why with all the aid we have received this has not decreased more in the past
9256949 this is also a cultural problem the woman is the last to get medical attention after the children and the father they are in bad shape by the time they come to the doctor
9256950 have improved at all levels of education the female share of enrolment drops at each higher level of education
9256951 the cambodian government is committed to increasing education opportunities for women at all levels from primary school to university during the next five year mandate
9256952 we have some vocational training centres now but not enough and they are not responding to demand this is important in the context of the garment industry which we not only want to stay in cambodia but to value add and not just use labour
9256953 we are not sure about the exact numbers but they are significant
9256954 although we are concerned about the conditions some of these women face overseas we the government encourage labour migration due to the level of local unemployment
9256955 you wouldnt be able to do these awful things to me if i werent still in this chair
9256956 there were some people that i thought in some cases were less of a player than they were a year ago i thought some of the guys actually improved moran norris would be an example
9256957 he did not practice much here as we are all aware of
9256958 i cant believe that he said those things to me
9256959 no mom the honeymoon was picture perfect it wasnt until we got home that he said those horrible things
9256960 honey what could he have said that upset you so badly
9256961 four letter words mom i cant believe that he said those things to my face
9256962 although the news isnt all good this report provides us with an important benchmark
9256963 the data in the report will serve as a baseline that sanctuary staff can use to measure future changes in grays reefs extraordinarily valuable and productive marine ecosystem
9256964 for three quarters we did our job up front to relax for one drive like that we cant do that but we rebounded right away
9256965 palin palin hes been callin obama inexperienced and not ready to lead and now he gets sarah palin oh you see obamas speech last night i cried hes gonna be president
9256966 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9256967 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater
9256968 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
9256969 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
9256970 should schools in new hampshire not open on tuesday because of the hurricane it would be an overreaction
9256971 i was shocked and saddened to learn of the charges against rep ryan it is critically important the public have confidence in the integrity of the legislative process that is why i have taken immediate action and removed rep ryan as chair of the house transportation committee he will be replaced by the committees vice chair rep robert williams of concord

9256977 sa umpisa pa lang magkagalit na talaga kami ni wilma si annette and felipe gozon lang ang may gusto kay richard
9256978 tinapatan nila ang lahat ng tv appearances ni richard sa abs cbn kung may utak siya galvante dapat naisip niyang this is richards movie
9256979 personally we do not have a quarrel with annabelle wala rin akong quarrel with her and we have not violated any contract with her were always careful in implementing the contract
9256980 birthday ni dingdong august 2 at si marian august 12 ano ba yan dong ang layo ng 27 para mag celebrate puwede naman 14 15 16 17 bakit tumapat sa play date ng mga bata richard and kc wednesday pa tapos free pa puwede namang weekend dahil araneta yun sinadya talagang araw ng showing hindi ko maintindihan
9256981 hindi namin hawak ang booking ng araneta coliseum and i was told fully booked na sila sa original date na gusto namin which is august 29 and 30 two days talaga dahil ang isang araw is for the set up you can check with the booking of araneta at wala talagang libreng date kundi august 27

9256985 this is a very relevant discussion right now weve got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world
9256986 how do you get activity going if the moon is owned by everyone at the same time
9256987 im happy to deed over half of my acre to a common acre pool i see this as a way of reconciling a right of individual ownership and the idea that the moon belongs to the whole earth
9256988 its much easier to solve this problem by thinking it through and thinking through what would most benefit the best interest of humanity rather than doing it once its a mess
9256989 in conclusion who owns on the moon no one who should own the moon no one does this stop property rights no the best way forward is probably some sort of property licensing body like how it works in geo
9256990 when the inspection period would get beyond lets say a year and a half i think thats really going beyond what regulatory oversight should be
9256991 i gotta tell you something i dont have a great deal of confidence right now that i am actually getting what i am paying for
9256992 when theres a lack of oversight theres a potential a greater potential for abuse
9256993 it would be beneficial to have a national coordination of efforts
9256994 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9256995 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9256996 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
9256997 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
9256998 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
9256999 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

9257002 i am indebted to the lights of broadway to you to the skies of bagdadi to the red army to the cherry trees of japan to everything about which i have not yet written
9257003 may mga binago lang ako sa first draft ng script at sa second draft mga ilang lines doon na kinailangan ko na lang damdamin dahil that time im trying na my best to heal maganda kasi sa pamamagitan nito madali kong nakaka chat ang mga friends ko when im feeling lonely
9257004 nagiging bonding moments din namin ito ng mga anak ko dahil nakakapag download kami ng movies songs and videos nagagamit din nila ito para sa kanilang researches sa school lalo na si renz sa pamamagitan nito nale lessen ang longings namin for rudy na siyempre hindi na forever naming makakalimutan
9257005 nag start kami sa egypt bago kami pumunta ng israel sa holy land
9257006 no regrets kami ng mga anak kong sina ralph at renz kahit talagang mahirap its sacrifice and penitence noong una sabi nila bakit daw kailangan pa naming pumunta ng holy land puwede naman daw naming gawin ang healing process dito sa pilipinas
9257007 nanibago rin kasi ang mga anak ko dahil as early as 5 30 a m gising na kami iisa lang kasi ang bathroom sa hotel room namin kaming tatlo pa ang maliligo but later on naintindihan din nila at naramdaman na nila ang ginagawa namin very hectic talaga ang schedules namin but its a very humbling experience na kami ang nagbubuhat ng aming mga luggages kung sumasakay man kami ng bus nilalakad lang namin ang lahat ng lugar na nasa itinerary namin
9257008 hindi lang yon inner healing process kundi naramdaman ko talaga ang direct encounter with the lord doon pa lang parang nabawasan na yung denial state ko naging lighter na rin ang feeling ko dahan dahan makakabalik na rin ako pero hindi pa katulad ng dati na sunud sunod ang trabaho ko
9257009 yes may miracle physical healing ding nangyari sa akin tulad ng ibang mga nakasama namin sa pilgrimage
9257010 bago kasi kami umalis nag underwent muna ako ng mri test dahil sa severe headache na nararamdaman ko lagi after the death of rudy nakita sa result na ang mga veins ko sa head ay may mga parang beads at hindi diretso ang veins parang may humps
9257011 last tuesday august 26 may naramdaman na naman akong sakit sa ulo pero bearable na kaya medyo natakot na naman ako
9257012 hinihintay ko pa ang ginagawang contract para sa akin ng abs cbn at kung magiging happy ang puso ko sa ginawa nilang kontrata pag uusapan namin yon ni nanay lolit solis her manager
9257013 ayoko nang sumali sa network war tapos na ang three year contract ko sa gma network nakapagtrabaho rin ako sa abs cbn for two years kung babalik ako doon alam ko maiintindihan naman ako ng gma pero wala pa naman akong final decision pag aaralan ko pa ring lahat
9257014 wala wala akong alam tungkol doon wala pa namang kumakausap sa akin
9257015 pero nagpadala ang gma network ng contract for ralph para magdirek sa kanila at kay renz para sa isang project pero pinag iisipan pa niya kasi gusto muna yata niyang tapusin ang studies niya sa up diliman hes second year college na sa philosophy pag uusapan pa namin yon ni nanay lolit dahil sino pa ba ang magma manage sa kanila kundi siya
9257016 inimbita niya akong mag conceptualize ng cd na i will also do some narrations select songs and invite some of my friends to sing
9257017 you know there were so many intriga a lot of people were trying to put richard and kc down i mean it was a very stressful time especially hindi pa halos tapos yong pelikula
9257018 now na kumita na yong pelikula talagang pinakita ng mga fans ni richard and kc ang kanilang full force sa pelikula i think lets just all be positive na lang
9257019 you know kung may tampuhan mang naganap its not because my mom or my brother are threatened by anybody its just the fact na sana kung may gawin silang project magsuportahan na lang di ba pinatunayan naman nila na kahit na may tapatan isyu talagang tinangkilik pa rin ng mga fans and pelikula
9257020 right now lets just be magnanimous in victory lets be humble lets be gracious and dapat magpasalamat tayo na talagang kumikita yong pelikula ang kung may tampuhan man im sure maaayos din yon
9257021 nakikiusap din ako sa lahat ng mga intrigero panay tawag panay text kay just leave her alone right now because shes so busy iniikot niya lahat ng mga sinehan at mga simbahan para magpasalamat
9257022 wala rin silang sinasabi sa akin parang sa inyo nanghuhula lang din ako kung ano ba talaga sila na ba o hindi kasi ayaw ko silang i pressure kasi ang mga tao kapag pine pressure sila the more na naiinis sila
9257023 lets just leave the bagets alone para ma develop ang friendship
9257024 despite her being the daughter of sharon pinapanood namin hinahangaan ng tao si kc is so down to earth
9257025 ang importante sa akin talagang namana niya kay shawie sharons popular name in showbiz ang pagiging magalang sa lahat ng tao ma pr siya so for me importante sa akin yong ganun mabait at maganda ang ugali
9257026 i just found out lately na lang na ikinasal na pala si joyce id like to congratulate her and sana ang marriage niya hindi maging katulad ng marriage ko sana forever and ever amen di ba
9257027 ang masasabi ko lang sa mga couples who have a long distance relationship its always nice that youre in the same house and youre in the same country long distance relationship in the beginning is very exciting but at the end of the day kapag mag asawa na kayo importante talaga na nasa iisang bansa kayo
9257028 kung mayroon mang hindi pinagkakasunduan namin or kung mayroon kaming communication id rather keep it to ourselves you know i think its better
9257029 i think for yilmaz and i its best to fix things privately kasi kapag maraming masyadong publicity nagagalit siya e gusto niya ng tahimik lang so i wanna give in to his wish its also good for me also kasi thats the process of moving on
9257030 i think yilmaz and i are both mature and if theres anything na dapat pag usapan whatever it is basta for the best interest of our kids i think thats what we should follow
9257031 hindi naman po siguro ganun kabilis yun o kung anuman
9257032 hindi kasi parang ano e siyempre nenerbyusin ka di ba gagawin tapos papagalitan ka pa ng direktor mo tapos hindi ka raw marunong humalik ang pangit ng halik mo parang kasi ano yun akala ko dati bubuka lang ang bibig mo kissing scene na yon e may art pala yon dapat sabay kayo depende sa ganun
9257033 hindi naman pero alam mo yun inaaral pa siya e kami lagi kaming palpak ni pj palayaw ni piolo kapag nagki kissing scene di ba first kissing scene namin take five take six ata kaya sabi na blurp ako hindi naman
9257034 ganun pero kaso nga lang in character ako kaya hindi ko masyadong pinapansin hindi as lyka ito as lyka sinasabi ko sa sarili ko
9257035 kahit pinapawisan yan tsaka palit nang palit ng damit kung may time ligo ganun
9257036 oo nga e ine expect ko na e i think may dalawa or ano ata kaming love scenes sabi ko pa ang yabang ko pa e nakapag love scene na ako direk rory quintos e sa
9257037 tapos binigay ko yung dvd ko tapos gel wala pa sa ten percent yung ini imagine ko e hindi direk grabe na yan hindi wala pa sa ten percent ko ito actually pag uusapan pa lang namin yon ni direk rory pero siyempre si direk rory yan malaki tiwala ko sa kanya
9257038 kinakabahan pero tingin ko mas kinakabahan si piolo sa akin
9257039 ay ako po sobra kaya lang na starstruck na naman ako
9257040 wow naku sobrang happy po ako na natatanggap ng pamilya ganun din naman si luis sa bahay namin
9257041 hindi ko alam e ewan ko wala naman akong binago sa kanya hindi naman ako nagbabago ng tao siyempre nakilala mo yung tao na ganun na bakit mo babaguhin
9257042 siyempre tatay ko yun hindi kasi isa yan sa frustration ko e buong pilipinas alam yung mukha mo di ba tatay mo hindi so yun nag aantay pa rin ako ng technology
9257043 actually joke niya yun e pag inaantok na ang mga tao siyempre kung ikaw ba naman kunwari bading mapapatingin ka o kaya matatawa ka na lang sa mga pinaggagawa niya
9257044 okey na po yun im happy na okey na ang lahat natapos na lahat once in a while nag uusap kami pero hindi pa kami nagkikita kasi siyempre busy pa si ms claudine sa mga taping taping
9257045 actually kapag nagsalita ako medyo foul na rin because importante sa akin okey na kami ayoko na talagang pag usapan sa tingin ko mas okey na rin kung may problema kayo sa isat isa nadadala yun sa usapan na hindi naman kailangan i involve ninyo lahat ng tao sa paligid ninyo so ayun pero may respeto ako kay ms claudine
9257046 e kasi ang tao na lang yung makakakita like kami ni kc hindi namin walang ganun e nag uusap kami ako suporta sa movie and si kc nanood ng lobo sa amin ginagawa lang namin ang trabaho namin and proud kami kapag meron kaming na achieve na maganda or tama because alam naman namin kung gaano kahirap yun di ba wala namang isyu isyu trabaho lang naman di ba tsaka yung usapang prinsesa prinsesa kalokohan yun sa totoo lang ayokong maging prinsesa
9257047 hindi loko lang hindi seryoso walang ganun nagtatrabaho lang po ako
9257048 maski nga cameo payag ako pero imposible yon tingin ko hindi ako papayagan pero feeling ko hindi rin papayag ang kabila gma 7 to work with me basta mahal ko silang dalawa kc and richard
9257049 sa tingin ko malayo pa yung mararating ni maxene may lalim na rin ang acting niya
9257050 si angelika naman magaling pa rin siya hanggang ngayon very professional very versatile para ngang matagal na kaming magkatrabaho ulit e
9257051 yung nagka amnesia na ako eksena ko yun with maxene yung wala na akong matandaan kung saan ako galing pati ang pangalan ko hindi ko matandaan drama kaagad yung first scene namin ni maxene at nagawa ko naman nang maayos
9257052 okey po maganda namang lumabas yung eksena sabi ko nga medyo naiilang pa si maxene pero nakaalalay naman po ako sa kanya
9257053 nakaka flatter na sinabi niya yun natural lang naman yung ganun sa akin bilang mas nauna sa kanya sa showbiz dapat lang naman siguro na ako ang umalalay sa kanya at saka para rin naman yun sa mas ikagaganda pa ng mga eksena namin
9257054 lahat naman ng mga ginagawa naming sine novela may pressure talaga knowing na may possibility talaga na mai compare kami sa mga original actors na unang gumanap sa roles namin actually nung una ko pa lang malaman na si direk joel lamangan ang magdidirek may pressure na e lahat naman ng trabaho mas magandang may ganung feeling para mas pag igihan pa namin ang pag arte
9257055 choice ko po talaga na hindi panoorin kasi po baka may mga eksena na ma conscious ako at least matapos ko munang gawin ito at saka ko siguro panonoorin yung original version guided naman po ako ng script pati ni direk joel maganda na rin po yun para hindi ko magaya yung atake ni gabby sa movie
9257056 were going out actually at nae enjoy ko siya nag e enjoy ako going out
9257057 hes funny yun yung hindi nakikita ng mga tao kasi lagi siyang seryoso sabi ko nga sa kanya ngumiti ka nga ng mas madalas hes funny hes young hes enthusiastic pareho kami ng mindset pagdating sa trabaho
9257058 hindi pa namin napag uusapan ayaw ko munang maging exclusive im still enjoying this moment of my life na ang daming bago were going out pero ayoko pang i label sa ngayon kasi mahirap e kapag nagkaroon na ng commitment dun na nagiging komplikado ang mga bagay bagay
9257059 most of the time with the asap group kasi dun naman kami nagkakilala after every asap on sunday makikita nyo kami sa restaurant kumakain kaming lahat or nagbi videoke kami at nakasama ko siya dun
9257060 hindi ko pa alam ine enjoy ko pa ito sana wala munang ganun kasi hindi pa ko ready buksan uli ang puso ko
9257061 nakikita ko dapat mag concentrate muna kami sa trabaho kasi ngayon niya jake lang nakukuha ang attention na gusto niya ngayon ko lang nakukuha ang projects na gusto ko dapat mag concentrate muna kami or else baka ikasira namin pareho
9257062 sa part na yun hindi ko na alam pero totoong nagkikita kami i dont see anything wrong with that kasi wala naman siyang girlfriend wala naman akong boyfriend saka hindi naman namin nile label ang sarili namin as exclusively dating
9257063 believe in yourself all the time kasi nagkakaroon ako ng moments na tinatanong ko kaya ko ba to do i deserve this baka hindi ko mabigyan ng justice si betty na touch naman ako coming from him and he delivered it in a very very sincere way
9257064 the real jake is someone very enthusiastic hindi siya nagpo focus sa negative side nagugulat nga ako kung bakit siya ganun hes very very mature for his age and i really admire that
9257065 pero masyado pa akong bata noon kaya parang naglalaro lang kami
9257066 after cogie si john lloyd paano ba kami nagkakilala ni john lloyd parang nakalimutan ko ata basta nag guest siya sa kabilang istasyon gma 7 basta before pa after

9257109 yes po kaya nga medyo kabado ako sa simula ng taping namin pinapanood po sa amin ang original story pero hindi ko po kailangang gayahin ang acting ni ms dawn siyempre po sarili ko po kung paano ko i tackle ang kanyang character dahil siguro po hindi namin kayang lampasan ang husay ng acting nina ate sharon cuneta at gabby concepcion at very supportive po naman si direk joel gagawin ko na lang kung ano ang best ko
9257110 hindi po totoo yon kasi noong nasa abs cbn pa ako ginawa ko ang

9257119 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
9257120 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
9257121 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
9257122 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
9257123 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
9257124 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
9257125 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
9257126 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
9257127 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
9257128 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
9257129 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
9257130 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
9257131 something that is violating moral principles not conforming to the patterns of conduct usually accepted or established as consistent with principles of personal and social ethics

9257133 daddy is my teacher and i am your teacher mommy
9257134 when i have daddy put in on upside down then it looks the right side up when i look down at it

9257140 obama said before a raptouros crowd of more than 84 000 at denvers invesco field
9257141 mccain told a roaring crowd of 15 000 supporters in dayton ohio source
9257142 weve put a 7million bid on the table to manchester united
9257143 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9257144 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9257145 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9257146 there will be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9257147 the reason for his breakdown on friday evening in the away game at karlsruhe was probably a circulatory collapse
9257148 i went to visit umit in hospital and what he wanted most of all was to get out of bed and be back on the football field
9257149 his immediate concern was about the match and the result rather than his state of health
9257150 on the pitch his life was in acute danger five emergency doctors then applied immediate medical treatment afterwards he was responsive again and his heart rate was stable
9257151 when i went on the pitch he was lying there still lifeless
9257152 therefore we continued the heart massages which colleagues had already started because of the heart failure
9257153 he then shortly came round but was immediately gone again inside he came to there he was so confused that he wanted to go straight back out on the pitch again first we had to calm him
9257154 it will be a big test for the club the players and certainly for me
9257155 this is going to be a massive two weeks for adelaide united
9257156 our players with the exception of paul reid paul agostino and cristiano are not used to this
9257157 the good thing is most of my squad are experienced players now and i am confident that they will able to retain their focus in what is shaping up as a challenging two weeks
9257158 fortunately we will have a full squad of 23 players available because diego is back and kristian sarkies should be ready this week
9257159 its just a shame the fifa date comes up next weekend i would have loved to play one of those five matches next week
9257160 it is always difficult for new players to adjust quickly to a new environment
9257161 but cristiano showed his quality in bagging the two goals and he could have had a hat trick too
9257162 in the first half he was a bit tentative but after getting off the mark you could see that his confidence grew and his second half performance was terrific
9257163 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
9257164 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
9257165 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
9257166 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
9257167 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
9257168 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
9257169 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
9257170 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
9257171 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
9257172 my writing is definitely dash happy and i get a lot of critiquing for that
9257173 the share of people with icomes over 100 000 6

9257175 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
9257176 we wanted to offer consumers a flat tv with a design so small that when all is off it would seem that if it is a painting on the wall
9257177 some of the early concern was that this deal would set off a wave of mergers that clearly didnt happen
9257178 i didnt see any senators falling on their swords and saying this deal cant happen
9257179 the argument about fuel price problems has taken the edge somewhat off the merger
9257180 concern in congress focused less on the particulars of the delta northwest merger than on the question of whether it would be the first of a series of dominoes falling
9257181 the justice department has not indicated that they are leaning in any direction
9257182 this is really the opportunity for the u s airline industry to compete on a global basis
9257183 when we look at the traffic in the united states today the majority of the traffic carried to and from asia europe the middle east and africa is carried on foreign flag carriers
9257184 prod the justice department to look further to look deeper and be more anticipatory about what happens after they approve this merger
9257185 it doesnt appear that well be able to stop the merger
9257186 we dont have what it takes to avoid this merger
9257187 i would hope that we can work through this and get commitments to keep as many jobs as possible in minnesota and keep as much flight capacity here as possible
9257188 yet to receive detailed information from either northwest or delta officials as to the potential negative impact on jobs as a result of the merger
9257189 i will continue to push for the best deal we can get
9257190 we know these things were going to be used as weapons
9257191 this is sending the wrong message regardless of how you feel about these people they had a right to be there
9257192 this is a charge that police use for preventive detention
9257193 it requires that no actual criminal act be committed and borders on criminalizing political advocacy
9257194 everybody i know whos protesting is going to be peaceful
9257195 theyre here to support freedom of speech last i looked that was still in the bill of rights
9257196 a criminal enterprise made up of 35 self described anarchists intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9257197 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers
9257198 average is about the worst thing you can say about somebody

9257200 coach put the ball in my hands and i just tried to come through
9257201 we knew duane would get us that yard and he did

9257222 permethrin is a member of a pesticide class called pyrethroids which are similar to the natural insecticide pyrethrum present in chrysanthemum plants it is effective against a broad range of pests such as external parasites and flying insects permethrin and other pyrethroids are commonly used to control adult mosquitoes products containing pyrethroids usually contain piperonyl butoxide pbo which makes the pyrethroid more effective in killing insects permethrin and other pyrethroids work by over stimulating the nervous system of insects causing the insect to die

9257228 we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind
9257229 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress

9257234 i just want to have a the hills spencer amp lauren just like israel amp iran e online
9257235 today i read on a blog that i went to the doctor and he said i was overweight and i cried and went to planet blue because i was blue and bought 6 pair of size 0 jeans
9257236 my doctor says i am right on target with my weight gain have not been to planet blue in at least two years love my maternity jeans they have stretchy tops it is awesome
9257237 carrying a child is the most inspiring emotional amazing experience of my life
9257238 my weight and my pant size are the absolute last thing i am concerned about i am only concerned with having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby people who talk and judge pregnant women s weight need to get a life
9257239 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
9257240 what do you think i work out to every day i know the whole thing by heart
9257241 its about how i feel about spencer and my relationship
9257242 i only talked to her when i got booted from my place and i was on her couch
9257243 i used to live with lauren and holly lived with us for awhile so they were friends and my sister can be friends with whoever she wants
9257244 think blink or sleep on it the impact of modes of thought on complex decision making
9257245 if you have to make decisions you have to do your homework
9257246 i did some research to try to figure out why the dutch had been able to see differences we hadnt
9257247 both cars in the experiment were equal so i would expect roughly equal numbers of the subjects to chose each car
9257248 its overly bold to recommend that as a way of making decisions
9257249 but that doctor has 20 to 30 years of experience and has in the past employed deliberate decision making so maybe over time these decisions become automated
9257250 going with your gut may be right when youre an expert for example maybe choosing lunch every day is easy because we do it every day but we dont move every day so when making a choice about where to live we have no expertise
9257251 i have a lot of respect for paris shes ballsy
9257252 shes learned to play with paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena

9257254 isabel and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests

9257261 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9257262 proof that there is a god in michael moores pals make documentary films ap
9257263 i dont like the bitch shes just fake phony amp shes wack
9257264 better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt

9257275 im in line at beijing airport and realize u s basketball star jason kidd is standing in front of me and hes wearing a cardinals hat i asked him what the connection was and he said it goes back to meeting la russa back when both were in the bay area said he really admires la russa and wears the hat as a superstition kidd said he hadnt played in a losing game for the u s in international competition since he started wearing the hat
9257276 hes the rookie and rookies tend to have peaks and valleys as he is in the process of having right now
9257277 i dont believe it of course im a christian but i believe that my kids are smart enough to tell the difference between reality and made up nonsense like people rising from the grave and living forever and that sort of nonsense
9257278 i knew this was coming but i figured it would be later in the year
9257279 if we are going to conserve them we need to know more about them where they live what causes the nests to die
9257280 the last few years have been really bad for bumblebees we think its probably the weather but we dont know we need to know how many nests there are we need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them
9257281 bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss pesticides and intensive agriculture
9257282 further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside as wild flowers set less seed and disappear which in turn could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife
9257283 were suspecting that bayer submitted flawed studies to play down the risks of pesticide residues in treated plants
9257284 bayers management has to be called to account since the risks have now been known for more than 10 years
9257285 it has the capacity to take out more ferret habitat than anything weve run up against and do it in such a short order
9257286 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9257287 were learning as we go we really dont know the answer to that yet
9257288 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9257289 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9257290 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9257291 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat
9257292 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9257293 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination
9257294 the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
9257295 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low
9257296 many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
9257297 its a historic event we are going to see this more and more as the years go by
9257298 a new record low could be reached in a matter of weeks
9257299 transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice free summers would soon become normal
9257300 im on a see food diet i see food i eat it
9257301 we just tell people its the house with the purple front door
9257302 colonial revival on the outside then the kitchen and baths are more art deco so theres a sort of schizophrenia
9257303 arches were popular in the 1930s and aluminum was a modern material when the house was built
9257304 its more economical if youre willing to work on it we have no plans to move anytime soon
9257305 shes been telling people she hopes shes dragged away with a cocktail in hand so that this issue makes headlines
9257306 my density has brought me too you i mean my destiny
9257307 just because you made something so special and fantastic for you doesnt mean its going to be so special for everybody else
9257308 the demand to adopt one of these precious pups has been tremendous the compassion of the local community is like nothing i have ever seen before
9257309 the majority of these dogs were the breeding dogs that need the most rehabilitation to be able to go into a loving home i would highly suggest that anyone interested in adopting a puppy mill dog do their research because it is a huge commitment
9257310 theres only one vessel that can ferry you past lauras moat and thats fiction
9257311 in it for the power and adventure and human connection and not because of any wonkish devotion to or interest in the issues
9257312 arent we both lucky to live in a country that allows the expression of this kind of criticism
9257313 i have all the confidence in the bullpen and i knew i wouldnt have been able to get the job done either
9257314 complete games are great and all that but the complete games i threw even early in the season they took a toll on me i wasnt up to par two starts down the line so i dont want that to effect me especially this late in the season when every five days i go out and every game means something and ive got to be able to put in six seven eight quality innings where i can give the team an opportunity
9257315 im not going to send a guy out there that says he is done
9257316 since they say the waters will be here until the end of october im making a boat
9257317 we will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies
9257318 from tonight we will begin supplying them with cooked food
9257319 we have had nothing to eat except some rice cakes and palm sugar
9257320 but one of the things he wanted to watch before he went on the dl was him playing night game day game so hes fine
9257321 but im inclined to maybe a night game day game give him the day off the next day well see how that goes
9257322 give david a chance to play just mix up our lineup a little bit
9257323 were not scoring any runs so i thought id put a few different faces out there today
9257324 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9257325 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9257326 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9257327 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9257328 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9257329 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9257330 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9257331 my father was a pioneer in the development of less radical surgery of diseases of the larynx which helped avoid total loss of the voice
9257332 patients came to temple from all over the world to be treated by him
9257333 the only item charlie removed which he gave back to a patient was an engagement ring
9257334 my father maintained the simplicity of small town rural life
9257335 this year the school district got the largest increase in budget from the state and over the last couple of years the school district has received over 2 billion in additional funds from the commonwealth
9257336 i thought there was something wrong with me i didnt fit with the cheerleader set
9257337 through the indicator i learned that the way i am is ok
9257338 i was a type that a lot of other people were introverted that freed me to go through the world being who i was
9257339 i was the only woman in some of those lecture halls
9257340 one thing ive learned in life are the limits of control
9257341 the purpose of knowing your type is to give you a better feeling about who you are but the next step for us is to help people look at their imperfections to see accept and forgive their dark side instead of projecting it out on other people
9257342 does not belong to any political party it is an enduring symbol of our nation and it belongs to all the american people
9257343 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
9257344 americas problem is that it has lost its way in recent years
9257345 part of it is the nfl scouts want to see him be more consistent and see him make good decisions game in and game out
9257346 his mobility is probably something that they have questions about
9257347 its nothing too drastic but i think its something that is going to give us a little something different than what weve had in the past
9257348 the thing about it is weve had time to get it all in and all sorted out
9257349 the kingsway theatre will open soon and play movies once again
9257350 these older theatres are an addition to the community you can see throughout the city where theatres have closed things have kind of dried up
9257351 if they dont use it were not going to be around again
9257352 in a way the shutdown of some of the festival locations was a real wake up call for the city it was a case of dont know what youve got till its gone now people are really turning out to support the cinemas
9257353 i guess they felt that after a couple of years the theatre would never reopen or at least never reopen as a movie theatre
9257354 the theatre here did well and had a loyal following theyve been longing for the theatre to reopen so i think therell be a lot of interest here
9257355 theres a lot of ways to make the theatre profitable beyond just making it a movie theatre
9257356 in the second we picked up the speed and got more aggressive
9257357 tiffany and setter paige weber are the foundation of what we do
9257358 we want to bring everybody else up to their level
9257359 i was really nervous in the beginning friday mornings first match but i knew i would get in the rhythm
9257360 my teammates supported me and said just play your game thats how i prepared myself mentally
9257361 you just dont know who will play when the lights are on shes a nice right side blocker she touched a lot of balls and now we have some options up front
9257362 you cant take any team for granted we sort of relaxed there but we came back we had to work for it
9257363 i want a better team out there on the field
9257364 i want to make myself and everybody else happy by winning a western athletic conference game i like the progress we made we are more athletic and we are bigger
9257365 hes running with the ball better than i have ever seen him and he is taking command with our offense and putting the ball where it belongs
9257366 jackson is a guy you have to be aware of
9257367 he can crease you and he is an excellent runner he is a big time player he is really what makes them go
9257368 the bottom line is youve got a major internecine battle a kind of civil war among drug cartels
9257369 it has intensified because the stakes are high theres a great deal of money to be made
9257370 youre sending a signal to the calderon government to the police that you mean business
9257371 this is the result when you dont play ball with us
9257372 they have to respond in a symbolic way that creates uncertainty in the public this is what they have been doing during the last months
9257373 it hasnt changed my driving at all not a bit i just have to work harder
9257374 we do see reports of a significant change in the types of cars people are buying but ive been mostly surprised at the lack of a reaction
9257375 one had hoped that these prices would deter driving but people have coped better than we hoped they would
9257376 price appears to be a highly effective way of influencing behavior
9257377 price alone doesnt win popular support or acquiescence there has to be a package of a variety of different policies including improvements to public transport walking and cycling
9257378 we thought opportunities were getting better for young indian women but the harassment only seems to be getting worse
9257379 the latest statistics are terrifying and it clearly points to male rage
9257380 underneath our incredible social change the indian male is experiencing nothing short of a psychological frenzy
9257381 i was never really taught how to act around a girl
9257382 when we were growing up girls were never sent to school usually they were married off right away
9257383 i liked being the breadwinner and king of my house but india is changing now my daughters in law work and think they can therefore be bosses and queens of the house some men find it a struggle we are trying to adjust to the new ways of girls venturing forth it may be better in the end since the women now earn money
9257384 if india is really going to become a world superpower it has to stop killing its girls in the womb
9257385 if india wants to shine then its women should be allowed to shine
9257386 in many ways the south asian woman is out of the oven and into the frying pan
9257387 they bring home money they share in power in the society but they are also doing something very powerful that may enrage men toppling the old family structure
9257388 we probably needed to be more physical in the first half
9257389 but rather than rolling over and getting slaughtered we won the second half and i look at that as a positive against a team that was in the class 1a semifinals last year
9257390 it was one play one play can happen when you get a breakdown and you dont let it bother you and carry over into the rest of the game
9257391 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9257392 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9257393 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9257394 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9257395 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9257396 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9257397 i feel like our way of life is being destroyed
9257398 why punish the owners of the oil companies who are largely pension plans group or individual and individual investors why should we punish some american firefighters who own oil company stocks more than american firefighters who own drug company stocks or tobacco stocks why tax away the savings of some americans because they happen to own a share in a company that supplies a totally legal absolutely indispensable product like oil i dont get that at all
9257399 hard hitting interior enforcement will reinforce the strong stance we are taking at our borders we will aggressively target the growing support systems that make it easier for aliens to enter the country and find work outside of the law this department will counter the unscrupulous tactics of employers with intelligence driven worksite enforcement actions and combat exploitation by dangerous smuggling organizations with the full force of the law
9257400 its a shame because i thought that line had grown some cohesion last year and everybody knows how important the left tackle position is
9257401 but the good thing is i think the vikings understood this potentially could happen from what ive seen in practice and on tape hicks is a natural left side player
9257402 i think they got him a significant number of snaps on the left side in training camp just in case do you want to open against green bay indianapolis carolina and tennessee without mckinnie no way but i think they are good enough up front to weather that storm especially because they run the football so effectively
9257403 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9257404 if the situation which exists now stays the same oil production will start to decline seriously in two years
9257405 why because today those who work in the oil industry find it easier to take the cream off the existing fields than to find new fields
9257406 the russian government has few people with the mentality of statesmen
9257407 today the aim of many people is to become rich at the expense of the state
9257408 are often perceived as a burden and companies consider the salaries paid to them as a form of tax
9257409 i think we have a choice with these 100 million youths that are growing up now
9257410 they can be 100 million opportunities or 100 million ticking time bombs
9257411 i never imagined that that one of my friends or a roommate would go for a job like that
9257412 it was really heartwarming to go to a restaurant and see someone like you a familiar face
9257413 no disrespect to the players in the lower leagues but i feel i was ready for this step i did think it would be to a good championship club but this opportunity has come along now and im not going to let it go
9257414 i was captain of wolves when i was 20 and did quite well but for one reason or another a couple of injuries or big players coming in my chances were limited
9257415 i went out on loan and probably didnt fulfil what i wanted to do early on in my career i had to take that step down to mk dons and in fairness it was a great stepping stone
9257416 i really enjoyed my time there and worked my socks off to get this opportunity
9257417 im under no illusions that its going to be a very hard task for me and im sure its raised a lot of peoples eyebrows
9257418 i dont feel i have to prove people wrong but i just have to prove to myself that im capable of playing at this level and i believe i am
9257419 the standard of football is obviously a lot higher and the players im playing with are a lot better but its a chance im really relishing
9257420 there are international players all over the place and the standard of midfielders is fantastic i am under no illusions as to how hard its going to be to get a place in that team but its a fight im prepared for
9257421 if i thought he might have problems making the step up i wouldnt have chased him
9257422 we have got steven reid here who played for millwall and is now playing regularly for us and his country
9257423 sometimes when you are in the premier league and you have money at your disposal you tend to look at the 6m or 7m players but there are a lot of good players in league one and two and the champion ship
9257424 keiths a good player he scored 14 goals for me at milton keynes last year
9257425 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9257426 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9257427 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9257428 i still feel like if im 1 on 1 with somebody i can beat them but everybody looks at me as a quarterback i look at myself as a quarterback also but its a little different ive got to change my mind set i guess well see
9257429 its always good to be out there playing with the guys this is really an opportunity for the young guys to get evaluated and see what they can do but its time to get the show going
9257430 training camp is behind me and the next thing is the real deal
9257431 im excited im just ready to get the ball rolling
9257432 its a big adjustment going from the left side to the right side
9257433 i like it on the right side but there are going to be ups and downs its not going to be perfect or pretty all the time the competition from the offensive line on that side is better so you got to take the good the bad and the ugly over there
9257434 i respect him and the way he played the game but i cant dwell on the fact im replacing him im not replacing him ive been here he was here with me he left
9257435 so im just moving my position to the other side to be able to create the same kind of atmosphere he had when he was here which is rushing the passer making plays just being a dominant force on the defense i dont want to replace him
9257436 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9257437 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9257438 i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career
9257439 we need to come to practice ready to bring up our intensity level
9257440 we cant just sleep on the teams that we dont think are very good weve got to take every game as a learning experience and step up every week
9257441 c program files national instruments labview 7 0 labview exe
9257442 c program files national instruments labview 7 0 labview exe
9257443 the thing about graham alexander is hes a very good football player
9257444 he likes the ball and hes comfortable with the ball at his feet and he goes looking for it
9257445 that role suits him to a tee and because hes been playing at the back he knows how to read the game there
9257446 some people could say its a front sweeper you play with but we feel hes good at contributing when the ball goes further up the park as well because hes a very good passer of the ball and he can set up attacks as well as break them up
9257447 with grezza alexander just sitting there youve no worries about whos behind you because he can just push and pull us as he needs to
9257448 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9257449 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9257450 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9257451 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9257452 i have never seen a ground as boggy in my life
9257453 if we dont get the drying weather as you can see it is grey and overcast then it might be the same again
9257454 i saw the defender stop so i just went and i had to come down with it
9257455 it was a good first win and the kids are really excited
9257456 we need to get better at punt coverage and special teams
9257457 it was electric and the kids went out and took it to them the difference in the game was the offensive line holes for the running backs
9257458 its tough making those mistakes but you have to bounce back from them
9257459 its one play at a time you must live to fight another day
9257460 we have to find a way to eliminate those were going to keep chopping wood with our defense
9257461 any time youre three seconds away from winning the state championship youre going to want to get back to the state title game
9257462 everybody remembers the state championship game but you have to move past that
9257463 its a great combination and carey is going to keep defenses off balance
9257464 we know we have a lot of talent and its tough to get everybody the ball
9257465 we didnt play super but we did enough to win
9257466 i was especially happy with the killer instinct of the defense
9257467 it was a tough game it took us a little bit to get adjusted to foothills
9257468 our defense stepped up right at the beginning of the second half
9257469 they got us a good turnover and we capitalized on it
9257470 even though we lost i think its a good place for us to start
9257471 cienega is a very loaded playoff team you always want to open with the best team possible and that shows where your players are right now
9257472 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9257473 if i turn up the heat in the dome and we practice in there i dont think that makes a difference on saturday
9257474 what we can do to make a difference is to make sure we are running enough so we can get into condition
9257475 the driver is dependent on the following vis that are not part of the driver or in vi lib
9257476 the driver is dependent on the following vis that are not part of the driver or in vi lib
9257477 there were a lot of doubters but we proved that the ciaa is a football conference
9257478 our conference can play with anybody catawba is a good team
9257479 we did good coming out caught a few balls almost got the running game going and then i guess they woke up
9257480 maybe they came out a little flat a little sleepy those are some great players man theyre guys you just cant sleep on
9257481 i was like oh i almost didnt know what to do it was so big
9257482 i think we just kept making minor mistakes every drive
9257483 missing throws dropping balls missed blocks any of those always seemed to happen on third down
9257484 theyre so athletic it just wore on us for 60 minutes its almost like a powder keg when you play a team like this and you know when you get off the plane thats the way its going to be for 60 minutes theyre going to come after you
9257485 it wasnt like we came in here to look good and hope we play good thats one reason were disappointed
9257486 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9257487 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9257488 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9257489 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9257490 theyre expecting it to be a category 3 monday night into tuesday
9257491 once we get into motion and go to work then its going to be business as usual
9257492 unless you study the game you dont understand the implications of a win like that
9257493 i didnt hear a whistle it was probably some pitt guy blowing the whistle
9257494 we made so many mistakes today and the defense had my number
9257495 im sure the team is hurt im sure nobody expected this its tough
9257496 we were hearing everything about lesean mccoy and their great running game so we wanted to make sure we handled that and tried to get them into passing
9257497 that bowl loss lingered and i get asked about that to this day thats done i hope
9257498 they gave us some unusual formations and we had a tough time adjusting to it
9257499 it would have been nice to get a touchdown but you know we follow the leader wannstedt
9257500 it feels good anytime you can help the team win
9257501 weve been battling i like the way weve been doing that
9257502 i hit it in the right place where nobody was standing and it worked out
9257503 raul ibanez is probably one of the most underrated players in the game
9257504 he has a decisive role in avoiding any possibility that his core team is supporting and promoting this
9257505 to secretly record the telephone calls of the president of the supreme court is something from a totalitarian regime
9257506 the 12 hour fasting is to overcome and ease conflict and suffering in the world and particularly for freedom and justice of the people of tibet and china
9257507 have given assurances that there is absolutely no cause for concern all that he needs is a good rest
9257508 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9257509 tireless lifelong work for the rights of the disabled and his significant contribution to the democratic development of our country
9257510 in weak democracies like mexico legal protections are necessary to prevent a tyranny of the majority over minorities
9257511 i told the guys something was wrong and i had to go home i just wasnt feeling right wahl said
9257512 i got dealt a bad hand wahl said last week
9257513 but the world doesnt owe me anything ive had a good life ive caught a couple of big fish and had a lot of fun
9257514 but i stopped counting he said his biggest a 56 incher and a couple of 54 inchers
9257515 george is just a wonderful guy said russ peterson 62 of minnetonka who wahl introduced to muskie fishing
9257516 everywhere he goes people know him said paul hartman 38 of blaine a longtime friend and fishing partner
9257517 thats what happens when youre the guy selling the best big fish bait made the eagle tail has caught more 50 inch fish in muskie contests than any other bait
9257518 a muskie almost jumped in my boat chasing a lure he said
9257519 it was a big fish too it scared me to death you see something like that it changes your life
9257520 since 1976 ive only caught one walleye and that was by accident
9257521 walleyes are great you can catch them all he quipped
9257522 i figure ive crossed the border up and back about 252 times
9257523 you literally eat sleep and breathe muskies period he once said
9257524 were the biggest muskie expo in the country he said
9257525 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9257526 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9257527 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9257528 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9257529 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9257530 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9257531 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9257532 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9257533 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9257534 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9257535 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9257536 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9257537 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9257538 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9257539 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9257540 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9257541 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9257542 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9257543 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9257544 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9257545 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9257546 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9257547 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9257548 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9257549 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9257550 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere
9257551 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9257552 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9257553 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9257554 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9257555 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9257556 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9257557 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9257558 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver brad smith can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9257559 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9257560 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective
9257561 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9257562 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9257563 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9257564 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9257565 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9257566 it will be a difficult game because we are not known for our performances at burnley
9257567 i thought it was just me last season but i have checked the record books and its not a happy hunting ground for us
9257568 we are going to have to try to break the hoodoo
9257569 theyve probably had a similar start to ourselves and are looking for a wee bit of form
9257570 theyve had a few players in and out during the summer
9257571 theyve got a lot of good experienced players but theyll be smarting from their results so far this season and theyll be coming here looking for a point if not three
9257572 but we need to be looking at ours rather than theirs
9257573 our game plans to make sure we keep it tight at the back and build on tuesday night create a few opportunities and hopefully well take them
9257574 plymouth like ourselves will be eager to get as many points on the board as possible
9257575 ive played against pauls teams a lot especially when he was manager of st johnstone and dundee united
9257576 hes a very likeable person and i think everyone i know has a good word to say about him
9257577 hes got his illness just now which we all hope he copes with very well
9257578 we have a very young squad down here at the moment
9257579 it will be up to the more experienced players to take a few of the younger lads under their wing
9257580 this season could be some what of a building exercise
9257581 we know the quality is there in the squad but it is relatively inexperienced
9257582 it was great as a fan to get involved with the hawks and see my sons out there on the ice
9257583 my one claim to fame was refereeing a game between manchester storm and basingstoke that was live on sky sports a few years back
9257584 it is going to be quite demanding to run the hawks and my own business but i am excited about getting stuck in
9257585 i have been a fan for many years and i am looking forward to driving the club onwards
9257586 i feel there is plenty that can be done to improve aspects of the club including boosting the attendances and getting in more sponsors we have lots of new ideas
9257587 with the help of the personnel on and off the ice we will ensure the setup is right and running smoothly
9257588 the times i have been there i have gone there as a player and i could affect what happened on the pitch but as a manager its going to be different
9257589 i started there as a kid and its a proud moment to go back there 20 years down the line as a manager
9257590 the last thing i want to do is make this about from back page paul ince going back to upton park because its not about me its not about paul ince its about what my players do on the pitch
9257591 but you know the reaction i am going to get i have been back there nine or ten times now and it probably wont change
9257592 west ham will always have a place in my heart i started there when i was ten or eleven i love the club i love the fans that will never change irrespective of what reaction i get
9257593 im a big man ive got broad shoulders it will be the same again tomorrow it wont affect me i just dont want it to affect my players and we just have to concentrate on what we do
9257594 if you do well at west ham theyre the best fans in the world if you dont then you know what youre going to get and im sure curbs is aware of the situation
9257595 a lot depends on how the game goes if we can get at them early doors and score then we might have be able to turn the crowd against their team
9257596 we did the same at everton silenced the crowd and thats what were going to try and do if they score first obviously theyll be singing his name curbishleys
9257597 our record is not the best at upton park but records are there to be broken
9257598 it is shocking a few minutes at the start of the second half killed us
9257599 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9257600 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9257601 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9257602 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9257603 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9257604 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9257605 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9257606 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9257607 you have given me and my family more you have given your people and this country more than you will ever know
9257608 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9257609 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9257610 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9257611 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9257612 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9257613 what he did on this day he is not really able to say other than he believed at the time by setting fire to a copy of war cry in this cabinet he was exorcising the witches which occupied his flat
9257614 theres nothing the matter with you apparently apart from drink and this very strong form of cannabis you allow yourself to decline
9257615 the serious aspect of this was the fact that you committed this offence in this ground floor flat in the early hours of the morning and it was a three storey block of flats
9257616 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9257617 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9257618 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9257619 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9257620 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9257621 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9257622 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9257623 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9257624 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9257625 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9257626 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9257627 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9257628 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9257629 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9257630 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9257631 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9257632 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9257633 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is
9257634 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9257635 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9257636 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9257637 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9257638 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her
9257639 she said that she yelled something like terry wait and this was at about the same time as she pushed on the door to try to get into the bathroom and at the same time she heard a shot
9257640 i fell in love with cheryl the first time we met
9257641 i let someone come between you i which should have never happened
9257642 i look back on everything see where i gave up love companion ship for attention affection it would be wonderful if i could turn back our lives for the past four years
9257643 if you live gods will and give with a happy heart you will reap the rewards
9257644 do you remember where you were 13 years ago on this day
9257645 he just wasnt the happy go lucky guy id known all my life
9257646 to keep cheryl in the style she wants to live
9257647 i always thought my uncle was in pretty good financial standing
9257648 it was just a shock to me that his finances were in that bad condition
9257649 one day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you
9257650 i would say its not been quite as good this summer the fishing he said
9257651 we had bad weather cool and wet during the peak of the pheasant hatch said kurt haroldson dnr wildlife biologist generally that means bad news for pheasant production he said
9257652 normally i would forecast a decline in the pheasant population he said
9257653 but we also have a lot of hens out there and that could compensate for the weather
9257654 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9257655 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9257656 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9257657 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9257658 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9257659 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9257660 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9257661 the end result does not reflect the quality of effort by our team for most of the game
9257662 we played a good quality tactical game in the first half and the first 20 minutes of the second half we just struggled a little in the latter half of the game
9257663 the end result does not reflect the quality of effort by our team for most of the game
9257664 we played a good quality tactical game in the first half and the first 20 minutes of the second half we just struggled a little in the latter half of the game
9257665 we didnt put ourselves in a position to win the game because of the mental mistakes made
9257666 it doesnt surprise me that we made the mistakes the best thing that we can do is take this film and this game and build on it well get better
9257667 i think coach is right when he says that we only have about 50 percent of the offense in right now
9257668 i expect us to be so much better in game 2 than we were today you cant put this all on gary he needs time to throw and weve got to give it to him
9257669 this offense is so much better than what we showed today
9257670 the opportunity popped up and i took it straight away i wanted to play in england i have been in italy for 10 years so i think the change is at the right time
9257671 the english league at the moment is probably the best in the world so for me to measure myself in the premier leagie has probably come at the right time
9257672 after playing in italy for a long its a different style of football but i think if the club has invested in me they obviously think i can do the job
9257673 i am just keen to get out on the pitch and earn my stripes
9257674 hes had six years in serie a which i know is a very tough league
9257675 he is a cultured player who gets around the pitch and can tackle
9257676 he is another player who is good for the squad
9257677 i wanted to try to stay in the football league if i possibly could but the games changed so much that i dont think anyone was willing to take a gamble on someone my age
9257678 i wish someone had given me the chance to prove myself but when the season starts getting up and running and youre not in anyones plans its hard to face but you just have to get on with it
9257679 when i was at burnley they were the best years of my footballing career
9257680 it was a big part of my life because i was there a long time i played with some great players there and saw quite a few managers as well
9257681 we played oldham on the tuesday and had to win that game really but we threw a 3 1 lead away and drew 3 3
9257682 we had to win and personally i couldnt have wished for a better outcome it was a great day
9257683 people always though that we didnt get on which was a bit strange
9257684 he would always get more goals than me but as a partnership we were one of the best in that division not just through our goals but how well we worked together
9257685 running out of that tunnel seeing all those people with the music playing the fireworks going off all the screaming and yelling youre with your teammates theres so much excitement i cant even describe it its just amazing
9257686 he did some good things and made things happen for him
9257687 all week long we worked on getting the right blocks and the angles because sahuaro over pursues all the time
9257688 they did their job and i just followed them every time
9257689 it was a long night but i should have scored
9257690 i dont leave the game until it is over i am looking forward to it i am a georgia girl that is football country down there i cant wait
9257691 we probably have one of the lighter schedules in the conference
9257692 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9257693 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9257694 he does pull more from democrats but not as much as people think
9257695 but ive had over a week to think about it so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9257696 i would have loved it if we could have met in the final
9257697 my biggest worry is that shes so good sorry but im thinking about how im going to get past her
9257698 shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best its nice to feel like when youre playing your best
9257699 right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9257700 i have a very good feeling about the next round i saw serena play against her i dont know how to say her first name too well
9257701 it feels good anytime you can help the team win
9257702 weve been battling i like the way weve been doing that
9257703 i hit it in the right place where nobody was standing and it worked out
9257704 raul ibanez is probably one of the most underrated players in the game
9257705 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9257706 they are desperate because of defeats along the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9257707 there was big sound and people screamed and ran in all directions i saw several people covered with blood lying on the ground
9257708 he has practiced a lot better than he played today i thought he managed the game pretty good though
9257709 it felt good to get the first game under my belt
9257710 there was obviously a liability there getting off the field on third down in the screen game
9257711 we settled down and kind of took away their screen game in the second half
9257712 we had too many things like that penalty happen to us
9257713 it the car was up close to my house in the yard
9257714 i got a ticket for parking in my yard while having some painting done they also ticketed the gentlemans car who was helping us
9257715 where we get most of the problem is where we have rental property and there are multitudes of people living in the house
9257716 this isnt a big problem with single family occupancies but i have noticed in the past few weeks that college avenue has gotten particularly bad with people parking in their yards
9257717 everybody parks in their yard temporarily at one time or another
9257718 this ordinance isnt meant to address just a temporary situation this is for when it becomes a permanent problem if someone was issued a ticket and it was a temporary parking situation i think all they need to do is contact our police chief and work with him
9257719 if they the officers see a violation they can enforce it as far as i know it the ordinance has been around for a while its been enforced before and it continues to be enforced weve done a lot with abandoned vehicles weve worked very hard on the abandoned vehicles
9257720 they called back from the city and told me to disregard the ticket
9257721 but the whole thing is something that shouldnt have happened in the first place
9257722 weve having a 10 year reunion and its really nice to get back with all the old classmates and see how everybody is doing and root on the g men
9257723 a very good reminiscing feeling of good times at graham and good times at the stadium
9257724 i am excited to see all of my friends from yesteryear
9257725 ive never missed one and dont plan to miss one
9257726 ive been coming to this thing ever since i was four years old since 1984 ive been coming
9257727 its a wonderful event and it brings back memories from childhood from a little girl on through high school and obviously in my adult life
9257728 its almost like going back in time because you have so much school spirit
9257729 you get into the game and its like youre back in high school again
9257730 theres nothing like this in new hampshire or north carolina louisiana ohio all places that ive lived in the last 31 years so its a real experience
9257731 its a reunion with the people you grew up with your family your friends and its simply coming home
9257732 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9257733 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9257734 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9257735 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9257736 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9257737 to have the opportunity to come over here and play in a 70 000 seat nfl stadium great city where the fan base was pretty much even to play a bcs team what a great way to open the season
9257738 do i feel i played good 90 percent of the time yeah
9257739 but a senior quarterbacks got to play good 100 percent of the time
9257740 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9257741 and it is warm not something im really used to
9257742 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9257743 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9257744 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9257745 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9257746 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9257747 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9257748 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9257749 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9257750 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9257751 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9257752 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9257753 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9257754 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9257755 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9257756 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9257757 it just kind of came in the flow of the game
9257758 i was feeling it from the jump so i guess the coaches realized it and put the ball in my hands
9257759 we didnt accomplish very much offensively or defensively with tonights performance we didnt establish anything
9257760 i know in the past few years it hasnt been as bad as it used to be most of our problems around labor day weekend are traffic related we get duis and more car wrecks due to the volume of cars on the road
9257761 we are seeing a slight drop in travel and this is probably in response to the increase in the gasoline prices
9257762 we are seeing a few people on the road since the fourth of july because the price has gone down but travel overall is still on the decline
9257763 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9257764 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9257765 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9257766 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9257767 i thought we played well in that second half our effort was just much better
9257768 it starts with defense and we made a real effort to get it done on the defensive end i especially thought our guys down low were the key in that second half they crashed the boards and that led to easy baskets
9257769 the first half was just a feeling out process for us but we played much better in the second half
9257770 we were more aggressive coming out of the lockerroom and we finished plays that we were not taking advantage of in the first half our focus was taking it inside and hitting the offensive glass and that is the main reason we were able to pull away
9257771 everybody was so hungry after all that we had been through this past summer and the winter that it wasnt a matter of us staying focused
9257772 it was a matter of us just going out there and doing what we do
9257773 i told them lets save tearing down the goal posts for later on down the road
9257774 i want it to become a habit to believe in winning at duke i am sure they are going to come have some fun somewhere down the line
9257775 i kind of let that interception play into the rest of the game i should have just let it go
9257776 we had the momentum and we knew that we couldnt just let it down and let them come back on us
9257777 when you work at a convenience store its really a chance of your life these days
9257778 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9257779 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9257780 monday really looks delightful a little less humid with a much lesser chance for thunderstorms
9257781 we dont need to be overly concerned we need to be watchful of the situation
9257782 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9257783 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9257784 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9257785 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9257786 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9257787 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9257788 the main problem we face is a lack of equipment that detects explosives
9257789 the iraqi government released him and in fact they released a lot of people like him
9257790 the defendants sometimes pay a judge or bring in a witness and then they go free
9257791 they have a witness who said i was with ashraf mohammed al yas
9257792 i dont know what is going on when they captured me i was surprised
9257793 the real tehran is like a playing card you have to flip it over to see its true side
9257794 he was a bastard but at least he did something positive for us
9257795 in this business the only problem is flights if sanctions expand to flight bans were in trouble
9257796 if you want to know where we get them from i wont tell you
9257797 i always have my customers and what i have goes very quickly
9257798 when we are outside we are quiet and unobtrusive inside we do a lot of things outside nothing
9257799 there is a law against this kind of thing im not even supposed to be alone here with these guys
9257800 america is the first enemy the most hated enemy of iran it is the enemy of our property our lives and our religion
9257801 i live by allah minute by minute second by second
9257802 allah guides me constantly and he guides our beloved president ahmadinejad
9257803 we have now gone into a complete target obsessed culture
9257804 we are allocated so many targets to hit each year by the pct and if we dont hit them money is taken back off the practice
9257805 we had the opportunity to sell the practice to a big national group which we did we just hated working in the system thats what prompted me to set up a private practice
9257806 theres a lot of dentists doing the very best they can for patients within the system but we would like the system to change its incredibly frustrating
9257807 if you get a high need patient dentists are not wanting to treat them because they cannot hit their targets if you put one crown in you get 12 units but if you put five in you also get 12 units
9257808 so you either turn a blind eye to what people need and dont treat them properly or you treat them properly and dont hit your targets and the pct take money off you
9257809 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9257810 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9257811 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9257812 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9257813 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9257814 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9257815 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9257816 babies have very much higher levels of stress in childcare
9257817 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people the high flyers they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9257818 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9257819 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9257820 they dont want to keep the jordan valley but they want certain arrangements
9257821 in all likelihood were israel to abandon the strategic barrier of the jordan valley shoulder fired missiles capable of taking down a 747 jumbo jet would soon appear on high ground in the west bank that dominates israels international ben gurion airport
9257822 strategic depth is very important for israel but israel can have better security with a peace agreement than by keeping the west bank
9257823 people know that even if they apply for a permit they wont be able to obtain it
9257824 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9257825 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9257826 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9257827 we will not tolerate an armed presence regular or irregular on our border
9257828 eighty percent of the people in that town are farc militiamen or communist party members
9257829 if you fly over the border and look on the colombian side all you see is coca crops
9257830 while the ecuadorean side is nothing but thick jungle with cocaine labs hidden under the canopy
9257831 its no trouble for a colombian to become an ecuadorean
9257832 you can buy an ecuadorean id card for about 70 90 depending how fast you need it
9257833 lago agrio has been a center of rendezvous supply and refuge for the farc
9257834 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9257835 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9257836 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9257837 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9257838 since they say the waters will be here until the end of october im making a boat
9257839 we will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies
9257840 from tonight we will begin supplying them with cooked food
9257841 we have had nothing to eat except some rice cakes and palm sugar
9257842 i dont think theres anyone in darlington in any of the parties who come near to mark for commitment and sheer determination in what is a very difficult situation as a solitary labour councillor with two opposition councillors in the same ward
9257843 on his own he deals with a mountain of ward work as always in these matters the harder you work the greater the volume of casework you attract as your reputation gets around mark is a first class ward representative for harrowgate hill
9257844 residents have stopped me in the street to say that they feel i should not have been threatened with legal action
9257845 i was only working on behalf of residents if i was to be taken to court there would be a public outcry
9257846 it has cheered me a bit to hear that residents have taken this point of view
9257847 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9257848 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9257849 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9257850 make sure you have an axe because you will be busting your way out to get on your roof with waters surrounding you
9257851 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9257852 i am going to try and see if there are still people out there to bring in
9257853 i think we have been lacking some quality in the first three games
9257854 we are not in condition to win premier league matches we have not got players in the right slots and senior players are not playing the way they should be
9257855 weve got a lot of young players in the side but its not those players who are letting us down i dont think we have played well in any game so far although i thought we probably played better here than we did when we won at west brom and lost at home to blackburn portsmouth defended well and took their chances we defended poorly and didnt take our chances
9257856 we are shit we got what we deserved the players are poor
9257857 everything is wonderful we played well and was unlucky to lose
9257858 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9257859 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9257860 we spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out
9257861 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9257862 we believe we have reached a positive outcome for all parties involved without disruption to our business operations
9257863 the end result does not reflect the quality of effort by our team for most of the game
9257864 we played a good quality tactical game in the first half and the first 20 minutes of the second half we just struggled a little in the latter half of the game
9257865 about an hour and a half ago 20 to 30 heavily armed police officers surrounded the house
9257866 a heartening recognition that time in washington can be useful
9257867 up here above their shoulders for a lot of guys with me it might be at shoulder level
9257868 theres not going to be a lot of baseline rallies but still thats a tough serve
9257869 so i would expect that all of these celebrities who are flooding into denver probably are not going to st paul next week
9257870 you know weve been joking that wilford brimley will be huge in st paul
9257871 the saloon is open until 4am every night during the rnc
9257872 being an out of work actor in los angeles you get very creative i had to come up with something to support my acting habit
9257873 hes an extraordinary reporter i consider him one of the most accomplished talented storytellers in the market
9257874 bill and i have been talking for a while about a new role for him that role will not involve regular anchoring although i would expect people would see him filling in on occasion
9257875 the baby was just born five or six days ago they were on their way for its first check up at the hospital
9257876 its just a sad time for us all here in johnston county
9257877 in the coming months it will be tempting for some in congress to try to score political points instead of getting work done for the american people our citizens deserve better
9257878 we still have time to accomplish important goals for our country my administration remains hopeful that we can work with democratic leaders in congress on bipartisan measures to help americans cope with this period of economic uncertainty
9257879 do not expect this speech to define the presidents legacy
9257880 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9257881 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities for the republican convention because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
9257882 the choice in this election is as clear as the stakes are high
9257883 you would think youd be safe inside your home but apparently not
9257884 i think if the car wasnt parked here he wouldve gone through our kitchen
9257885 were going to do whatever we can to make you whole
9257886 they work toward this they train for this and they really stepped up and did a phenomenal job out there
9257887 were doing what we can now and hoping that it doesnt rain
9257888 but no matter what were going to do what it takes
9257889 i used to ride my bike up and down through here when it was a hotel
9257890 it was brought to raleigh to try to increase traffic and try to get people to bring their conventions here to the capital city
9257891 we certainly hope that the marriott will do for downtown what the sir walter raleigh did years ago it would be a very attractive place people will come here enjoy it and liven up our city
9257892 i showed up at the exchange around 9am to meet my usual contact but he wasnt there no one was there apparently the police had come in and forced all of the traders to go and applaud at a hammer throw competition or something i dont even know what that means anyway the only person in the whole place was this kid couldnt have been more than 12 years old but he assured me he was 21 he had the government document to prove it anyway i could see he didnt know what he was talking about so i told him i wanted to buy some gold at 780 dollars an ounce when he processed the trade i couldnt believe it because gold is currently trading at 800 an ounce it was the best trade of my life a personal best
9257893 he makes an okay living i guess but moishe showed me that the real moneys in foreign currency and precious metals i want to be like moishe
9257894 i used to be really into uri geller so i was thinking about becoming a psychic but then i heard about moishe rosenberg and i was like bending a silver spoon is cool and everything but bend some gold geller and then well talk so i decided to write my securities exam
9257895 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9257896 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know now as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as commander in chief
9257897 one day i made a remark about a jewish boy picking his nose and my brother said what the heck do you thing you are
9257898 einstein was found to have a brain that looked much like any other
9257899 friday night and beyond the shabbat experience step by step
9257900 gossip ten pathways to eliminate it from your life and transform your soul
9257901 well dont you know that jews dont take piano lessons on shabbos
9257902 i hate the thought of my son becoming one of them
9257903 what do you gain out of following a bunch of archaic rules
9257904 mark what with your obsession with finding the perfect cherry cheese blintz how were you even able to find the time and focus to write a book like this
9257905 mark we thought this was supposed to be about the original jewish olympics all we see here is a selection of various judaic olympic events throughout history
9257906 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9257907 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9257908 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9257909 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait

9257918 my mother in law wants the kids to check in twice a day when were traveling she has a map with pins so she can track us
9257919 we have to move to a different table were 100 yards to from away the air conditioning pneumonia ill get
9257920 sunday every meshuganahs on the road who drives on a sunday nobody
9257921 aunt rose that dress in bloomingdales windows perfect for you
9257922 my boss chose me to close that big deal in san francisco
9257923 they have the most crooked street in america there and a gazelle you arent you could tumble down like jack and jill splat
9257924 oy such delicious bobka i can hardly walk from that brunch
9257925 so did you take out the lamb chops for dinner
9257926 my mothers from the school that the minute you walk in the house you have to eat
9257927 she asks what can i get you and if i say nothing the question just continues one thanksgiving there were only six of us and she had two 20 pound turkeys plus brisket not to mention the eight sides and 15 pies and cakes and halvah i went on stage that night to do stand up and i just read the menu from her dinner
9257928 did you hear the one about the stupid jew and the drunken mormon
9257929 get out of my sight susie i dont want to see you till 8 at night anonymous
9257930 lament for racial divisions within the church and our communities combined with the active pursuit of a just reconciliation
9257931 the current wave of new monasticism needs the life and spirit that minorities bring because it is a more complete expression of what the kingdom is not the other way around
9257932 it is appalling that the most segregated hour of christian america is eleven oclock on sunday morning
9257933 staggering up the road where they collapsed near the corner of market and kent st
9257934 at this stage we are unsure what involvement if any that the shellbourn had he said
9257935 the lord is with everyone so of course everything would be ok
9257936 i think once i get there to arkansas im going straight to stone mountain ga
9257937 i gave myself a year and a half to make it in new orleans but the city isnt back from katrina and its time to leave
9257938 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9257939 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9257940 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9257941 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9257942 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9257943 there is an understandable concern about the high price of gas and food and many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy
9257944 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9257945 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9257946 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9257947 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9257948 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9257949 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9257950 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9257951 i guess the theme changes every year because it was pirate last year and caribbean the year before that
9257952 its still starting to sink in for me its just a blessing
9257953 i was waiting all day but in the nfl no news is good news
9257954 then sam texted me and it was a big relief because this was one of the hardest things ive ever had to do both mentally and physically
9257955 i want to show everybody that i belong in the league
9257956 its also going to be an honor and privilege to represent western new york and help put this area on the map at a national level
9257957 it started from a conversation between and myself complaining about photoshop both of us being
9257958 just because it would be unprofessional of me or others to rant about this or that aspect of the company in public dont for a second think its not happening behind closed doors
9257959 linux users luvs u we can has adobe applications and a currents flash versions kthanxbai
9257960 you kindly turn off the highlight on text when choosing a color for it but not when choosing a different weight
9257961 the music of the film is great and aadesh has done a brilliant job hari puttar has been developed keeping in mind the sensibilities of an indian family and the humor is outstanding
9257962 at t series we have always been keen on taking on interesting ventures hari puttar is one such film
9257963 red box is unique in its styling and food and hari puttars cool attitude and our haute cuisine brought in the perfect blend
9257964 hari puttar is a name that is so close to my heart as i have a friend from my home town who used to be addressed as hari puttar the name is so indian in its essence that i love it
9257965 despite what the church is saying filipino people especially the poor want family planning
9257966 they want to have control over what methods they use and they want the ability to choose without fearing a backlash from the church
9257967 life should be valued and its creation is a serious matter
9257968 couples who have the discipline to practice the church sanctioned natural family planning methods are in possession of true values of life and tend to pass it on to their children they also tend to be good citizens
9257969 if there is discipline in the marital bed then there is discipline in the streets there is discipline in schools there is discipline in the government
9257970 data shows that the poverty incidence is less than 10 percent for a family with one child compared to 57 percent for a family with nine or more children
9257971 we have a very conservative church in this country and the church still exerts a lot of influence in politics
9257972 the fact is economically we can not afford our current rate of population growth
9257973 about 5 800 babies are born daily one doesnt have to be an economist to tally how much more food water shelter medicine and other resources will be needed for their support
9257974 i will not sacrifice my principles for the sake of expediency
9257975 the proposals to send more u s forces to iraq would not produce a long term solution and would make our policy less not more sustainable
9257976 changing the dynamics surge and fight create breathing space and then accelerate the transition
9257977 our center of gravity public support is in jeopardy because of doubts that our iraq efforts are on a trajectory leading to success
9257978 i really like the four ways because you get to see three different offenses and defenses
9257979 you can get all different looks in terms of size speed level of competition and schemes
9257980 theres a lot of down time for the kids in three ways
9257981 in the four ways the kids are constantly moving around and i think that makes things run a little more efficiently
9257982 with the numbers we have going offense and defense with two teams is enough
9257983 the small schools like us barker roy hart and newfane get real nervous about the injuries because were so low on numbers so we just want to get some good work in and stay healthy
9257984 i want to give my starters a good test to make sure i have the right guys in place and then im looking for solid depth and players that can fill roles
9257985 the biggest thing we want to accomplish is to come out healthy
9257986 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9257987 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9257988 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9257989 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9257990 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
9257991 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9257992 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
9257993 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
9257994 this is a hard job to do on a bike
9257995 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
9257996 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
9257997 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
9257998 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
9257999 we call it the movement thats taking the nation by storm
9258000 you still have to be a tinkerer to make things work but thats changing
9258001 were going to see a lot more design features for recycled water and rainwater catchment
9258002 it makes you aware of the plight of the poor and the hungry and inspires generosity
9258003 to come out of ramadan better than we came into it
9258004 we start anew like a newborn baby with a clean slate
9258005 i look forward to the personal commitment and i know i can do it
9258006 it will give me an understanding of the physical and mental anxiety that the poor and hungry go through on a daily basis
9258007 and theres a focus on making our day to day lives reflect our spirituality
9258008 once this storm gets in the gulf of mexico and people really see how big and dangerous it is thats going to help our efforts to encourage people to leave
9258009 i would be ecstatic if we could say correctly forecast half of the time 24 hours in advance a rapid change in intensity which is the big problem with our errors
9258010 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9258011 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9258012 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9258013 considering what the economy is it is a wonderful thing to have so many people coming by whether they spend money or not remains to be seen i think any exposure to get the twin cities minneapolis and st paul name out there is wonderful
9258014 im a staunch democrat and so i kind of want to go down to that area of the convention and do some protesting or at least give some people the stink eye nasty looks
9258015 we would like the protest to be something that is family friendly that we can bring our children to there are anarchist groups that are planning to do otherwise
9258016 the relationship between st paul its government and citizens and the police department is an extraordinary one and one that at the end of this convention we intend to be just as strong as it is today at the same time we know some of the people who are going to be here are not necessarily local citizens and do not have the intention of being law abiding so our job is to sort through that
9258017 even though minnesota has voted democratic at the presidential level for so many years 2004 democratic presidential candidate john kerry only had a three point margin of victory in the state over president bush and so the margins have narrowed and because we have a republican governor a republican senator there is this notion which i think is an accurate one that minnesota is a swing state
9258018 the incidence is higher because the groups that are most impacted are highly represented in new york city men who have sex with men immigrants from certain parts of the world
9258019 they are highly represented here and for that reason we have three times the incidence of the rest of the united states
9258020 we are doing additional things to make sure we are reaching the target populations
9258021 one of our new prevention efforts is social network testing where we take people who are highly impacted sex workers men who have sex with men gay men and hispanics and ask people to bring their friends in to be tested that serves two functions one is to get people into treatment if theyre positive and the other is to interrupt the epidemic through knowing their status so they are not giving it out inadvertently to other people
9258022 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9258023 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9258024 i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career
9258025 we came in with the game plan that we were going to load up and run the ball so i was pretty prepared for it
9258026 i just wanted to let people know what i can do and help my teammates out
9258027 we wanted to get darel scott some confidence and once he got it he was gone
9258028 normally he would break some of those runs i dont think he quite had his third gear today
9258029 we probably ran the ball better than i thought we would run the ball but we probably didnt throw it as well as we have been throwing it
9258030 i thought he played pretty good in the first half
9258031 i know he can play better than he did in the second half
9258032 this is not like a moral victory i dont believe in moral victories
9258033 we had opportunities and we let them get away were greatly disappointed
9258034 we play a home game we make more money than playing this game down here when we scheduled this game i thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid acc school
9258035 obviously that last throw you cant be happy with i feel like i just misread it
9258036 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9258037 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9258038 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9258039 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9258040 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9258041 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9258042 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9258043 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver brad smith can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9258044 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9258045 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective
9258046 the chilies have sweetness even the hot ones have a nice bite but it goes away quickly so you want to eat more
9258047 the smell brings them in so many people who grew up in new mexico have come in with stories
9258048 she played well that time and im looking forward to continuing to move well and serve well
9258049 i just broke it a couple times just to be thorough
9258050 you guys kept me in there when i was losing my head
9258051 if this crowd comes with me the whole way who knows
9258052 it was one of my first matches on the atp tour
9258053 the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 oclock and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 oclock to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9258054 i dont know how he keeps it up physically anyway
9258055 i knew thats the way they did it when i came here
9258056 they brought me in when they already had dwayne and steve smith i think i made them better now they keep bringing in guys and you have to go out there and do it every day in practice i think theyve made me better
9258057 even if youre the fourth receiver youll catch 30 bombs
9258058 is that no starting job is ever set in stone
9258059 whenever anybody from back home asks me about my numbers i just say i wanted to come play in the best program
9258060 having all the other receivers around is making him better theres no question hes going to make a lot of big plays this year
9258061 but you dont play unless you know what youre doing and they dont know what theyre doing yet
9258062 like coach ruel says it was like i was cooking steaks back there
9258063 that came from 2005 when we really had a good offensive line
9258064 wed be on the practice field and the defense wouldnt give us any pressure and wed be yelling weve got enough time to cook steaks back here you know just to aggravate them
9258065 these guys did a good job today for about a week and a half theyve been making a lot of progress sometimes as a coach you have to tell yourself that theyre going up against our defense which is pretty good but jeff came back and hes like our glue and the whole thing is coming together
9258066 a lot of us had beards mine came in quick and then i lost track of time a lot of other guys shaved but i didnt my girlfriend likes it
9258067 the only thing is ive got to edge it up a little bit and trim it i dont want to look too much like a wolf
9258068 learning it takes a while but right now i think im pretty comfortable with it
9258069 i feel good with it so im excited about it
9258070 youre fired up the first play and after the first play is over you just focus on what youve got to do
9258071 it was fun to see him grow over the last week
9258072 and regardless of how this goes hell get better having had the experience and hell get better over the next two weeks
9258073 wow when the roll call of 60s greats is proclaimed hes so far under the radar even the yardbirds get more love
9258074 did you just stick it in a drawer or something
9258075 i put it on my tv and every time i looked at it i thought about how i beat you
9258076 when we are talking about peace were talking about something thats the imperative of our time
9258077 war has become so frightening in its capacity for destruction of the whole of civilisation that we have the responsibility of making sure that our actions are all directed by this single purpose
9258078 there are one billion seven hundred million people living today without sufficient food clothing and health facilities
9258079 theres definitely a chance this is not the final roster we have to wait and see
9258080 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9258081 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9258082 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9258083 do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9258084 im absolutely spent i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9258085 id say right now im annoyed at not figuring out this golf course very well
9258086 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9258087 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9258088 thats pressure thats what you thrive on to have to read all that nonsense listen to all that its totally different pressure ive performed in the big tournaments weve all seen what happens when you get batted for a week it happened earlier on in the year im tired of it
9258089 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9258090 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9258091 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9258092 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9258093 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9258094 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9258095 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9258096 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9258097 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9258098 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9258099 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9258100 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9258101 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9258102 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9258103 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9258104 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9258105 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9258106 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9258107 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9258108 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9258109 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9258110 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9258111 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9258112 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9258113 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9258114 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere ive always felt like i give whatever team im on a good chance to win but theres way more to it than one guy
9258115 we have a high level of respect for georgia southern
9258116 most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry a great majority of our georgia guys have high school teammates on their team
9258117 i dont know how theyre going to react if we were playing in front of 92 000 or in front of 4 000
9258118 i just dont know i wish i did i sure would sleep better at night
9258119 is it a good thing its good if we stay there if were there at the end
9258120 i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys and an excitement factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program but its going to be up for judgment every week from this week forward
9258121 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9258122 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9258123 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9258124 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9258125 does not ask us to believe things in a philosophical sense but to imagine them in an artistic sense
9258126 thanks to free indirect style we see things through the characters eyes and language but also through the authors eyes and language we inhabit omniscience and partiality at once
9258127 is an example of aestheticism the author gets in the way which is at bottom the strenuous display of style
9258128 forster is genially snobbish about flat characters and wants to demote them reserving the highest category for rounder or fuller characters
9258129 the very idea of roundness in characterization tyrannizes us readers novelists critics with an impossible ideal
9258130 commercial realism has cornered the market has become the most powerful brand in fiction
9258131 the efficiency of the thriller genre takes just what it needs from the much less efficient flaubert or isherwood and throws away what made those writers truly alive
9258132 lifeness life on the page life brought to different life by the highest artistry
9258133 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9258134 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9258135 our mission is to prevent anyone from claiming that dokdo is not korean territory
9258136 we are striving to offer scientific incontrovertible proof that dokdo is korean
9258137 as long as it doesnt bring damaging winds or flooding a tropical system can bring relief to an area in a drought situation
9258138 a northwest track could affect anywhere from here to florida
9258139 we think we have the best 53 man roster we think we have pretty good depth all around
9258140 andy reid said it best he improved from the first game to the second game and hes a big enough guy who can do it
9258141 he showed ability to be a fullback hes the one fullback on our roster hes going to get a lot of work
9258142 from how hes played thats definitely not the case he was blowing it up in there his aggressiveness and toughness the thing he needs more experience at is his angles and how he positions his body to sustain blocks better we think he wants to be the starting fullback for us and obviously he is right now
9258143 jerome is a great guy who has worked his way back from a lot of adversity
9258144 i dont think he will have trouble finding work every year he showed determination to come back hes played well
9258145 chris has not played a whole lot this season but hopefully he will get back this week
9258146 he made a ton of plays he was a tackling machine in pre season
9258147 he was not a real difficult decision he made a ton of plays and that is what you want your middle linebacker to do
9258148 competed well but we thought matt was a better fit for us
9258149 we still have a couple of days of rehab here before we start practicing for st louis but right now we think he is ready to go
9258150 i can understand that its tough leaving toronto being canadian and playing for a canadian team but when they told me i was going to philly i was like nice going to a ballpark where i enjoy playing in
9258151 consequently we get an experienced guy that can play some and hit off the bench cant hurt
9258152 we had claimed him off waivers so they couldnt do anything with him the only place they could move him was to us either they had to take the deal with us or keep him on the roster
9258153 i love pinch hitting its a situation where you usually pinch hit in a situation where the game is on the line
9258154 its fun to be in that atmosphere of being in the playoff race again its nice to see this team loose and having fun because ive been on teams before when you get in a race and everybody gets tight
9258155 they had geoff go down and needed someone off the bench he should be able to help them
9258156 theyll be minor things but things could pick up in the next day or two
9258157 she said you were 12 so youve changed a lot
9258158 you guys cant wait to get out there huh i cant wait myself
9258159 what is michigan football where is this program at weve got a bunch of guys in winged helmets who are going to go down that tunnel and play their tails off and will play with pride passion and intensity on every snap thats what michigan football is
9258160 because im new what do we call a double edge pressure
9258161 i dont want them blowing up because of all the free time they have
9258162 with all the freshmen we have we need to be in the stadium on thursday
9258163 two or three years from now we probably wont need to do that
9258164 i was supposed to be at a team meal at 10 30 and i got there at 10 31
9258165 bo schembechler never had wives and kids around like this
9258166 but i love the pace of this practice and bo wouldve too
9258167 weve got two recruits coming in for official visits this weekend
9258168 were going to sing the victors and were going to wear winged helmets were not going to change the tradition or the culture here
9258169 but tradition isnt going to get us a first down you have to earn that tradition isnt going to get you a degree you have to earn that and i hope every one of you does just that i dont think people outside the program really understand whats going on here
9258170 the day before we opened at wisconsin bo said lets take a walk
9258171 he said if i make you my quarterback can you handle 85 000 fans wanting your head on a platter
9258172 i havent told him yet but hes bright enough to know because he goes out there with the no 1 offense and takes a lot of snaps
9258173 the pepperoni roll is not sitting well in my stomach
9258174 when you choose a college its not a four year decision
9258175 when you make a big play celebrate with a teammates because chances are a teammate helped you make the play
9258176 were going to take the field like we own it
9258177 im not bsing you guys we have a lot of unknowns
9258178 i aint been in a game with yall but i cant wait to find out who you are
9258179 and you know its great that its the u s open
9258180 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9258181 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9258182 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9258183 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9258184 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9258185 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9258186 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9258187 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9258188 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9258189 governor schwarzenegger who was in san diego yesterday as the senate took up the budget has made it clear that he does not support our compromise budget and will not ask any republican to vote to pass it
9258190 is not fiscally responsible because it simply pushes our problems to next year
9258191 unfortunately weve been unable to get the type of cooperation that is essential to finding a solution without raising taxes
9258192 you guys cant wait to get out there huh i cant wait myself
9258193 what is michigan football where is this program at weve got a bunch of guys in winged helmets who are going to go down that tunnel and play their tails off and will play with pride passion and intensity on every snap thats what michigan football is
9258194 because im new what do we call a double edge pressure
9258195 i dont want them blowing up because of all the free time they have
9258196 with all the freshmen we have we need to be in the stadium on thursday
9258197 two or three years from now we probably wont need to do that
9258198 i was supposed to be at a team meal at 10 30 and i got there at 10 31
9258199 bo schembechler never had wives and kids around like this
9258200 but i love the pace of this practice and bo wouldve too
9258201 were going to sing the victors and were going to wear winged helmets were not going to change the tradition or the culture here
9258202 but tradition isnt going to get us a first down you have to earn that tradition isnt going to get you a degree you have to earn that and i hope every one of you does just that i dont think people outside the program really understand whats going on here
9258203 when you make a big play celebrate with a teammates because chances are a teammate helped you make the play
9258204 im not bsing you guys we have a lot of unknowns
9258205 i aint been in a game with yall but i cant wait to find out who you are
9258206 if the shield had failed fx would have quickly exited the scripted original series business
9258207 hes a man plagued by regret and the fallout of his actions starting pretty much from day one of the series
9258208 hes definitely become a guy that understands there is a tremendous consequence not just for himself but for everyone around him for the decisions that hes made but you cant change the spots on a leopard hes in the vortex and hes swimming
9258209 its a very collaborative show so we came up with a plan for this final season that we thought worked really well then we came up with a better idea so we changed the plan and thats always been the way that this show has worked best
9258210 i think i understand the game more trying different kind of shots too lately trying to add some variety
9258211 the steps needed to be in full compliance they accepted the responsibility for the oversights and worked with us cooperatively in outlining this agreement
9258212 we took a very long abandoned and polluted industrial site and decided to purchase it clean it up and restore it and basically return it to the tax rolls to benefit the local economy
9258213 we referred to it as our effort to de rust the rust belt
9258214 pose any health issue for employees neighboring businesses or area residents
9258215 it took us some time to figure out what the voc measurements were for the industrial process we do then to understand what the best technology is to rectify it
9258216 it would have been wonderful if we had understood this perfectly
9258217 needed a much more intensive computer system that was focused on record keeping helping us catalog all our required data keeping track of all site renovations and also training and we have put that in place
9258218 glad dep keeps such a tight lookout it helps make sure were compliant everything we do has to be in 100 percent compliance with the highest possible environmental standards this makes gamesa better in the long run
9258219 someone should keep a lessons learned list so we can apply this on an industry wide basis we hope to continue to make this site in every way shape and form gold stars warts and all a national example of how to do it
9258220 the body toxic how the hazardous chemistry of everyday things threatens our health and well being
9258221 adventures of the great chiweenie biking across america with a pack of teenagers
9258222 i know a lot of people on vacation dont want to hear that but we cant afford to have anyone injured in an incident like this
9258223 theres no doubt in my mind that the first batch we found was deliberately set and the batch we found today seems to be similar to whats washing up in ocean city and in one to two other towns
9258224 this material is waterlogged and looks like it has been in the water for quite a while
9258225 its a shame its a real shame for the town especially on a holiday weekend
9258226 were just glad it didnt happen on memorial day weekend because that could taint the entire season
9258227 something like this happening early in the season might make some people think twice about coming here
9258228 but i think by now the people who live here or have summer homes here are so loyal to the town they realize that what happened isnt the fault of anything the town has done
9258229 im more concerned about the safety of the people on the beach than whether or not theyll come down and shop in my store
9258230 i think thats the attitude of pretty much everyone here and i think thats why people are so loyal to avalon
9258231 its not the best of times but i dont think it colors the image of the town because i think people realize this is an isolated problem and not the kind of thing that was going with the ocean dumping in the 1980s
9258232 i havent heard about any mass cancellations from the hotel and motel people
9258233 and i think that the public appreciates that we are all taking precautionary measures to protect them
9258234 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9258235 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9258236 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9258237 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9258238 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9258239 theyre so much faster than michigan was we knew theyd have tight coverage but we couldnt execute one on one like we wanted
9258240 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9258241 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9258242 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9258243 this accord opens the door to the future cooperation and partnership between italy and libya
9258244 it is a complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9258245 in the name of the italian people i feel the duty to apologize and show our pain for what happened many years ago and which affected many of your families
9258246 in this historic document italy apologizes for its killing destruction and repression against libyans during the colonial rule
9258247 the proposals to send more u s forces to iraq would not produce a long term solution and would make our policy less not more sustainable
9258248 changing the dynamics surge and fight create breathing space and then accelerate the transition
9258249 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9258250 its a deadlock so we keep on protesting we are determined
9258251 our helicopters were barely able to fly for most of the day yesterday as it continued raining heavily till 4 p m
9258252 bracs approach to creating self sufficient and sustainable programmes on a massive scale has blazed a trail for development organizations around the world
9258253 the lions share of the prize money will be spent in sudan to mitigate intolerable poverty in that country
9258254 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9258255 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9258256 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9258257 fala couldnt come since he wouldnt promise to be quiet
9258258 he must have gone in there to get his paycheck
9258259 i got a phone call from a friend who saw greg walking into sutherland hospital with a girl who had a problem stuart said
9258260 i headed straight to the hospital where i spoke to greg and a police officer i realised we had a big problem but the major concern was obviously katies health
9258261 i was heading to church for my son jacks holy communion when i got the call i tried ringing greg several times on the way getting no better than a message until after church when i got a call back
9258262 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9258263 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9258264 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9258265 she was out there with then young son track pulling him around from house to house in a wagon
9258266 shes not afraid to speak her mind she really dropped the hammer on the politicians fleecing alaska
9258267 shes an excellent social conservative fiscal conservative and political conservative
9258268 if she can energize the conservative base it wont matter if she gets the womens vote
9258269 this is a really nice person and shes disarming in that way
9258270 she did some housecleaning with her department heads she had to learn about the sewers the libraries public safety
9258271 im still leaning toward obama i think sarah has been really good for our state and it would be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9258272 if it was her running for president thered be no question in my mind
9258273 the republicans right now are about big business and big oil i dont see sarah as a staunch republican in that way
9258274 maybe being big and being good at soccer were not the same
9258275 we dont know anything until the x rays come back
9258276 my lord my god show yourself merciful to these lovely people in their automobiles
9258277 i try to bless all the cars everybody needs a blessing
9258278 i hope they dont ever get in any car wrecks because i know that being handicapped physically and mentally will change your life
9258279 a lot of them dont know theyre getting blessed but thats ok
9258280 i know a lot of people who say i dont feel safe if jerrys not there
9258281 the first steps that he took were backwards with us hanging onto him
9258282 the top of the car was sitting on the seat rest
9258283 we just do as good as we can with the lord our god
9258284 wouldnt it be something to go through life not being able to talk
9258285 hes always praising the lord and saying its a beautiful day
9258286 it was my way of expressing how i feel when i see jerry
9258287 the first thing i think is i hope its not jerry
9258288 he puts a smile on my face every time i drive by he makes me appreciate life and every day that goes by
9258289 if your windows down you can always hear him laughing you just think of him and you want to smile you want to smile and cry at the same time
9258290 thats how high gas fuel prices are im at the gate right now
9258291 i told shun we were going to give him the ball and ride him as long as we could said niumtalolo during the post game press conference the great thing about shun is that he has overcome so much through working hard his overall development is something i am proud of his performance today was not a surprise we were waiting for it
9258292 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9258293 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9258294 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9258295 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9258296 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9258297 canada describes itself as a mosaic thats what torontos all about
9258298 but we dont have the kind of racial divides you do in the states for the most part we get along
9258299 there are hundreds of people buried there from the cholera epidemic
9258300 it may be more or less worthless but its still of value for the story thats inside
9258301 i decided i wanted to be the feather flower lady when i grew up
9258302 we help them do the things they want need or used to do in a way thats personally satisfying
9258303 the ability to establish a one to one relationship is crucial in occupational therapy
9258304 most of our graduates have jobs before the ink is dry on their diploma
9258305 dont know that mechanics do something other than work on a car
9258306 certainly there are career paths available to people who have the technical background and can show management and people skills
9258307 this would be a real opportunity for a new conversation between white people over these next 69 days
9258308 not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
9258309 but the many impressive speeches spectacular entertainment and eye pooping display of fireworks
9258310 who believes i have lots to give to our world and who trusts my willingness to do it who has faith that if i follow a qualifited leader i can listen learn and carry out the will of god to all of our benefit
9258311 obama made it clear that he was ready and willing to debate john mccain
9258312 our government encourages corporations to do these sorts of things
9258313 until this wealthy nation provides universal health care the poor are trampled
9258314 by these sorts of things i presume that you mean trying to feed as many people as possible as efficiently as possible and providing the food at an affordable price
9258315 ive used this example before genetically modified gm crops that benefit big corporations and hurt small farmers especially in the third world
9258316 if rick is around this weekend im sure he could supply you with some
9258317 i wasnt all that happy with obmas continuing the use of this messianic nationalistic language but ive come to ignore it
9258318 as far as biblical support for my claims i can only give you a few in this space but do you think the prophet amos would have supported these current republican values
9258319 didnt you read what i wrote about the bush administrations trampling of constitutional rights
9258320 how has tax cuts for the wealthy benefited the poor
9258321 we cannot sustain the current consumption of resources without environmental disaster
9258322 this is what my teleprompter says so im going to say it
9258323 mccain wont even follow osama to the cave he lives in
9258324 cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9258325 plenty of scriptures take opposition to the current regime in washington and what they are doing to our nation and to the world
9258326 what about the failed republican talking points that focus on personal attacks and fearmongering
9258327 believe it or not big guy moderatelad many of us dont get our news from the
9258328 apparently the computer wasnt telling me to do that sorry i would never have cut off geraldine ferraro
9258329 and considering the last paragraph of my 1 45 pm comment above your accusing me of being a luddite is absolutely laughable
9258330 isnt starvation one of the mechanisms of the free market to check the surplus population
9258331 i have to tell you this thing this may be my only chance
9258332 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9258333 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9258334 as much as you can expect in an opening game like this
9258335 it was a great feeling in front of 110 000 fans ill never do that again
9258336 when you first start you want everything to go right
9258337 but we are not yet in sight of the end
9258338 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9258339 it was kind of a timing post and i knew he was going to be open
9258340 i just let it go and he went up and got it
9258341 well start clark and if it looks appropriate to get devlin in well get him in
9258342 alguien deber a explicarme qu es una sanci n para rusia
9258343 lo dudo mucho pero si hubiera sanciones probablemente sean m s perjudiciales para la ue que para rusia

9258346 est n en muy buen estado los crujidos que se ven en sus muros son hist ricos pero no han supuesto apenas movimiento al edificio estamos ante una verdadera lecci n de arquitectura tanto en el uso del material las piedra de mar s para las b vedas y la de piedra de santany que sagrera utiliz para columnas y arcos como en la estructura del mismo
9258347 vamos a utilizar un sistema de limpieza de sepiolita mezclada con agua destilada y celulosa
9258348 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9258349 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9258350 as much as you can expect in an opening game like this
9258351 it was a great feeling in front of 110 000 fans ill never do that again
9258352 when you first start you want everything to go right
9258353 in no way be seen as an attack on gordon they absolutely were not intended to be so
9258354 alistair is one of gordons closest political allies and that is not his style
9258355 i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations
9258356 we have that at the same time as oil and food prices going up but i am also clear that the fundamentals of our economy are strong
9258357 as far as i m concerned you can bugger off back to melbourne
9258358 if you don t want it enough you can get f
9258359 as far as im concerned you can bugger off back to melbourne

9258361 big big big part of my life but ive got a lot of other stuff going on
9258362 it remains to be seen which show can regenerate their brand dancing attracts an older age group so i think theres room for both shows

9258365 there is considerable logic in virgin and bmi working as one we do not overlap on routes and a merger would give us a good short haul network and give them a good long haul network by doing that it would create a more formidable competitor to british airways
9258366 we are watching the situation michael really doesnt have anything to do with bmi any more in that he has effectively given up a decision to lufthansa over future ownership
9258367 it is great news and the fact that they have launched it before a ba aa filing to them demonstrates that the commission is taking it very seriously
9258368 if virgin is worried then the public should be worried together ba and aa will twist the arms of travel agents to give them business because of their dominant share of the market with the business market ba aa will go to the jp morgans and the goldman sachs who will have to use them because of their domestic networks transatlantic networks and european networks it will be sheer monster monopoly dominance
9258369 we would hope that the next administration is a more consumer friendly administration
9258370 used in a completely different regulatory and competitive environment in 1996 and 2001
9258371 obviously we would welcome it if we were given approval before the end of the year but if it runs into next year so be it
9258372 they might have changed their minds i am still interested in buying it from them
9258373 the west missed a major opportunity when boris yeltsin the former russian president was in power when russia wanted to join nato and the west turned him down
9258374 it is incredibly sad that russia is not now part of nato or of europe i hope the politicians can make amends businesspeople have got to do their best to trade with russia
9258375 the last fundraising failed because the investor base was too narrow its clear the company will need some cash at some stage and if it is going to stand a chance of getting such a capital raising away then it needs the strength of more shareholders
9258376 we are likely to breach the interest cover covenants when tested for the full year
9258377 we are seeing significant reductions on cover provided on certain construction companies as reviews are carried out we are also seeing the first signs of insurers increasing their premiums and we have been told by some insurers that they are looking at potential 30 per cent increases for premiums for companies exposed to the construction sector
9258378 we think we have the best 53 man roster we think we have pretty good depth all around
9258379 andy reid said it best he improved from the first game to the second game and hes a big enough guy who can do it
9258380 he showed ability to be a fullback hes the one fullback on our roster hes going to get a lot of work
9258381 from how hes played thats definitely not the case he was blowing it up in there his aggressiveness and toughness the thing he needs more experience at is his angles and how he positions his body to sustain blocks better we think he wants to be the starting fullback for us and obviously he is right now
9258382 jerome is a great guy who has worked his way back from a lot of adversity
9258383 i dont think he will have trouble finding work every year he showed determination to come back hes played well
9258384 chris has not played a whole lot this season but hopefully he will get back this week
9258385 he made a ton of plays he was a tackling machine in pre season
9258386 he was not a real difficult decision he made a ton of plays and that is what you want your middle linebacker to do
9258387 competed well but we thought matt was a better fit for us
9258388 we still have a couple of days of rehab here before we start practicing for st louis but right now we think he is ready to go
9258389 wed love to figure out the cause then we could keep future cases from happening
9258390 and i think most of this community should be upset because it could be their kid next
9258391 we call it the movement thats taking the nation by storm
9258392 you still have to be a tinkerer to make things work but thats changing
9258393 were going to see a lot more design features for recycled water and rainwater catchment
9258394 there are racers who throw in the towel pretty quick without broken arms with just a head cold
9258395 we had a bad fishing year that year so we didnt have any money
9258396 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse
9258397 ive always wanted to do something with veterans if i ever found the chance
9258398 through my own experience of getting benefits and applying for things ive always wanted to help every veteran i could find in helping them get their benefits
9258399 i really feel there is going to be a lot of support from the district the county managers office and through the dss where the office is located
9258400 so far everybody has had a tremendous willingness to work together for one common goal and that is the veterans
9258401 i am a true believer in once you submit something you follow up on it
9258402 my favorite part was everybody working toward one goal getting the crop in
9258403 everybody worked hard the worst part was early mornings and late nights
9258404 i knew at that time i enjoyed what i was doing i enjoyed the structure the camaraderie among the veterans and i re enlisted for six years
9258405 were seeing a lot of people wholl come right out and tell you theyre going to park the car and ride a bike
9258406 this is one of the few businesses that is benefiting from high gas prices
9258407 bikes with shocks on the front forks and on the seat gears
9258408 were selling trailers you can get two kids in that
9258409 they got baby seats seat belts were selling racks and baskets for groceries
9258410 with the two suspended players that gives us 52 players on the current roster
9258411 we will add another player before the opener against the bengals
9258412 yeah youre disappointed im just rolling with the punches and hopefully something develops
9258413 i would think the best case scenario for melvin would be to be ready to play when we get off this road trip
9258414 thats kind of how i see it if he can play before that i think its a bonus from how he feels today its improved but i think it would probably be doubtful for him to play in boston he might be limited he might be able to pinch hit with a day off thursday i think its more realistic for him to be able to play after that
9258415 ive just had a little cramp or something but ive never had a pull
9258416 you have to heal and let it heal i dont want to blow it up but it depends on how i feel this week
9258417 cabrera was fined an undisclosed amount of money and was disciplined accordingly by me
9258418 thats where were at i am satisfied that he recognized that what he did was inappropriate and i accept his apology
9258419 i talked about whats going on in september and some other things that i had to clear up but i really dont look to put a whole lot of emphasis on it
9258420 every time i have a meeting its blown out of proportion there were just some things that i had to discuss with the team i dont think its anything that deserves headline attention
9258421 i just dont see any need for him the next time before he pitches to do any kind of sideline work
9258422 i think he can just do flat ground work and play catch and get ready to pitch next wednesday then after that with the day off thursday well probably get him on a six day slot for a while i think what he needs to do is back off his throwing in between starts
9258423 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9258424 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work she said
9258425 shes right large amounts of research are coming in showing that particularly for children under two but also under three childcare is generally likely to be harmful to them afa spokeswoman angela conway said pointing to research from the us and uk
9258426 irresponsible saying many couples have no choice but to place their infant children into childcare
9258427 theres so many pressures these days on just being a good parent that having negative coverage on childcare like that is very frustrating for a lot of parents she told aap
9258428 things are different these days she said in response to the ms foxs comments
9258429 over 65 per cent of families have both parents working and for a lot of people its not about choice its because they have to
9258430 they both have to be earning money to pay off the mortgage
9258431 i dont see anything thats gone terribly wrong putting them into child care she said
9258432 largely supportive of ms foxs comments but the language used was
9258433 childcare is not a good place for babies and we support her in that but we know that many families have elected to put very young children and infants into childcare because of serious economic pressures and we need to face up to that
9258434 strong marketing strategies to convince parents children were better off in care
9258435 going out on the field it hit me we are the washington state football team
9258436 we stubbed our foot a lot it doesnt surprise me we made mistakes
9258437 ill be real honest with you we dont have a lot of play calls inside the 20
9258438 there were blunders on the special teams that need to be fixed and can be
9258439 coming out i had a few jitters because i havent played in a while
9258440 i was anticipating this moment and then waiting for a while i wanted to soak it all up
9258441 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9258442 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9258443 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9258444 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9258445 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
9258446 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9258447 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
9258448 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
9258449 this is a hard job to do on a bike
9258450 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
9258451 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
9258452 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
9258453 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth

9258456 barack obama accepted the democratic presidential nomination thursday night on a specially constructed soundstage in denvers invesco field his 44 minute speech mixed a searing indictment of his republican opponent and the republican incumbent with clintonesque personal touches and reaganesque optimism
9258457 barack obamas speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination thursday night was what many nervous democrats were hoping for a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him
9258458 the new obama unveiled before about 84 000 cheering supporters in a football stadium is more combative than the old obama and more sharply focused on the economic problems of the nations working class
9258459 good great or something else senator barack obamas acceptance speech thursday night unquestionably confronted two of his greatest challenges
9258460 now america pivots to john mccain and obamas bounce could be unusually short lived its only the fourth time in history that the two parties have had their national conventions back to back
9258461 the tropical storm is about five days away from possible landfall in louisiana and is predicted to build to a category 3 hurricane

9258466 as russia struggled to rally international support for its military action in georgia vladimir v putin the countrys paramount leader lashed out at the united states on thursday contending that the white house may have orchestrated the conflict to benefit one of the candidates in the american presidential election
9258467 the united states and russia on thursday traded some of their sharpest words over the conflict in georgia including a suggestion by russian prime minister vladimir putin that washington provoked the fighting to sway the outcome of the u s presidential race
9258468 just three months ago president bush reached a long sought agreement with russia intended to open a new era of civilian nuclear cooperation and sent it to congress for review now according to administration officials mr bushis preparing to scrap his own deal
9258469 israel will not agree to allow iran to achieve nuclear weapons and if the grains start running out in the proverbial egg timer jerusalem will not hesitate to take whatever means necessary to prevent iran from achieving its nuclear goals the government has recently decided in a special discussion

9258474 the georgia crisis provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain the old sores and divisions fester russia remains unreconciled to the new map of europe
9258475 if youre going to the beach youre going to be prepared for some delays
9258476 there shouldnt be that type of wait when youre just trying to go home
9258477 in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world and we have standards
9258478 they may be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9258479 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team
9258480 ill be disappointed if we dont because our performances have been fantastic especially in one day cricket
9258481 we beat the west indies 5 0 and weve come here and won convincingly today
9258482 weve got a fantastic squad weve got so much talent around australia and it doesnt matter who we play every time we walk out to play for australia we expect to win
9258483 it changes every day for our boys they can be wonderful with that minimal footwork and shot playing but they can also be ordinary
9258484 the people back home have built up this series a lot and the players felt that a bit today it looked like they werent up to it mentally
9258485 to be honest it was a little bit of a blur i cant really remember
9258486 it was good to get it out of the way in the first quarter and just worry about getting the win it was awesome to get it out of the way
9258487 it was under control roughy was blocking them which was good i will have to thank him hes a big boy
9258488 it would have been great for fev to get the 100 too with the two of us it would have made history
9258489 it was really exciting its a good part of the game to kick a 100 and then run back on in front of everyone really exciting
9258490 buddy kicking his 100th was a special achievement for him the first indigenous player ever to so and its a fair effort when the games been going for over 100 years
9258491 were really pleased thats been achieved now and we can really focus on going into september as deep as we possibly can
9258492 you think how many times hes hit the post during the season and even in todays game he hit the post early
9258493 its just a tremendous effort for him personally and i think youve seen the spirit of the team trying to get him over the line towards the end
9258494 to be one short it was a double blow because we got absolutely smashed
9258495 theres a bit of a romance hes played a lot of footy for carlton hes won games off his own bat and if we could go out of our way to maybe see if we could get him there for one quarter i think its fair enough
9258496 i suppose maybe we could have done that at the start on franklin i suppose thats the way he clarkson has seen it
9258497 si en tres meses no hay respuesta firme para abrir una negociaci n tomaremos las medidas que hagan falta y
9258498 falta lo m s importante que es una tarifa anti dumping
9258499 at the moment shoppers get 48 pencils for a pound
9258500 if costs went up there would be no difficulty in taking eight pencils out we would still have the value differential versus the rest of the high street
9258501 when a product is launched the quality is always wrong
9258502 nine times out of 10 you can reduce the quality because you are giving too much away to the consumer but in the light of the downturn and soaring inflation the search for savings has redoubled
9258503 many biscuit makers fight tooth and nail to keep their products at the 99p price point because they just wont sell if they are any more expensive
9258504 when mum goes shopping for the kids she is looking for biscuits that cost 99p she is less concerned about the quality
9258505 we have looked at reducing the size of our yum yums snacks to protect the 99p price point
9258506 the confectionery and snack boys do this a lot more though if they change the size of a packet of crisps from 55g to 45g is the consumer really going to notice
9258507 the retailers are very good at keeping checks on the ingredients panel they wont let manufactures use cheaper or substitute ingredients with premium products for example
9258508 there are ways of getting around that though you can strip an ingredient out of one part of the product if it is used in another for example on a cake you might have egg in the cake mixture but also in the icing
9258509 sometimes companies forget that for many people their products are everyday purchases
9258510 people can quickly move from being irritated to very annoyed if they think they are being ripped off there is a point at which it goes too far brands should never take liberties with consumers
9258511 while the product quality will often only dip marginally behind closed doors standards slip much faster when we buy up small companies we often see alarming health and safety or hygiene standards in better situations management would not let it get that bad but with their backs to the wall things change
9258512 la biotecnolog a es un sector estrat gico que se debe impulsar en balears para entre otros motivos diversificar su econom a por eso hemos desarrollado este proyecto de incubaci n de empresas del sector que se trata en definitiva de favorecer unos proyectos con desarrollos muy largos aunque con retornos muy importantes
9258513 durante el primer a o no pagan alquiler pero tienen que desarrollar el plan de la empresa en el segundo se les subvenciona entre el 50 y el 75 del pago porcentaje que se reduce en el tercer ejercicio hasta el 25 o el 50 dependiendo de las circunstancias
9258514 este sector genera empleos alt simamente cualificados no en vano creo que la uib impulsa en este curso acad mico el primer postgrado oficial en biotecnolog a
9258515 se trata de empresas que tienen un desarrollo muy largo un hallazgo est sometido a m ltiples revisiones y estadios que pueden dilatar su fase de registro en ocho o diez a os el xito es incierto pero en caso de darse los beneficios son incuestionables todo el mundo sabe que las patentes son una fuente casi ilimitada de ingresos
9258516 ahora hay que darle ca a al higo chumbo y hacer un gel con l crear nuevas bebidas con flores antis pticos naturales para que duren m s los alimentos
9258517 qu es lo que les ha motivado a instalarse aqu posiblemente que cuentan con todo lo necesario para el proceso mucha luz y di xido de carbono que es lo que utilizan las algas y todas las plantas para realizar la fotos ntesis
9258518 tenemos una planta de generaci n de energ a en el parque tecnol gico que funciona con diesel aunque nuestra intenci n es hacer que lo haga con gas natural que genera el di xido id neo para hacer este proceso productivo
9258519 ning n factor por s solo explica el accidente tiene que ser un c mulo de circunstancias desfavorables
9258520 un avi n como ese no tiene por qu caer si falla un motor durante el despegue ni siquiera si se incendia est n preparados para ascender ser estabilizados y poder aterrizar de nuevo
9258521 si la reversa estuviera activada o tuviera un fallo antes de despegar el piloto lo habr a notado si por alguna raz n se activ en el momento justo en el que el avi n se alzaba la nave se volvi ingobernable con toda seguridad eso s explicar a que el aparato cayera hacia la derecha
9258522 cuando el aparato llega a cierta velocidad es imprescindible que despegue pase lo que pase porque no tiene pista suficiente para frenar si el piloto hubiera detectado un fallo antes de alcanzar esa velocidad habr a detenido el avi n
9258523 es posible que los supervivientes hablen de la falta de velocidad del aparato sugestionados por el accidente
9258524 un ruido m s fuerte de lo normal en el tren delantero durante su aproximaci n a la pista
9258525 los md son aparatos seguros el mantenimiento actual es bueno y solo si se repiten fallos similares deber a ordenarse una inspecci n general
9258526 hay un celo especial en la tripulaci n especialmente en los pilotos
9258527 las compa as que sufren accidentes suelen entrar en una espiral econ mica negativa padecen un gran desprestigio y pierden pasajeros porque su nombre se asocia al accidente
9258528 no s si gos lbez es un delincuente o un enfermo mental
9258529 se lleg a gastar al menos fondos p blicos por un valor superior a los 21 000 euros en servicios y compras que en absoluto revert an en beneficio de la administraci n y que no eran necesarios para las funciones encomendadas y que nicamente pueden tener la consideraci n de gastos personales y particulares
9258530 i dont want this to go any longer and we want to get these teachers paid and their benefits reinstated
9258531 its a risky proposition to make a cash advance but if tom horne assures us we will be paid back then its worth the risk
9258532 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9258533 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9258534 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9258535 two minutes ago somebody just offered us coke and marijuana
9258536 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9258537 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9258538 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9258539 i feel that weve gone back to the starting point again
9258540 i was right beside him i put my hand on his chest i felt his breathing slow down and his heart beat stop
9258541 the doctor said he was brain dead i was waiting hoping somebody could do something
9258542 weve been together over 10 but weve been married for two years he was a bachelor all his life he was a wonderful man never drank never smoked and he was a vegetarian for almost 60 years
9258543 the two men began laughing at how silly erics bandages looked
9258544 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9258545 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9258546 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9258547 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9258548 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9258549 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9258550 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9258551 it shows a lot about our football team that we dug ourselves a pretty big hole against a good football team and we came out of it
9258552 presbyterian is a good team and they are going to win a lot of football games one of the big things for us was we made some adjustments defensively and basically told the guys to settle down and play your technique
9258553 i think offensively on the line of scrimmage we started to create some space and got the ball inside and outside then took it straight at them we had some big pass plays and i was pleased with the ways our kids got after it
9258554 i said i never looked at it in the first place
9258555 at one point she commented that she was glad it was over with
9258556 shes a wonderful person i did what i did and it was wrong
9258557 thats not the point id just as soon that she was out there making a buck paying me back
9258558 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9258559 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9258560 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9258561 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9258562 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9258563 this project really set a precedent for the state and the nation for dealing with animals on highways were just excited to see it get off the ground
9258564 were really lucky because the north cascades link to canada and they have great habitat and great wildlife populations but the south cascades are isolated that isolation would only increase as the traffic increases
9258565 the goal of the project there is to make the highway a visitor on the landscape recognizing that they want everything to function despite the highway
9258566 thats exactly what theyre trying to do on i 90
9258567 its an important argument to make in addition to human safety and connectivity for animals
9258568 and the nice thing is its a good story all the way around
9258569 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9258570 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9258571 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9258572 it feels good anytime you can help the team win
9258573 weve been battling i like the way weve been doing that
9258574 i hit it in the right place where nobody was standing and it worked out
9258575 raul ibanez is probably one of the most underrated players in the game
9258576 we need to put in place any measures from the report and recommendations that the atsb make will be implemented in full by the government
9258577 one of the things that must be not forgotten about this is the extraordinary response from the qantas pilot and crew he said
9258578 worlds best practice and declared the safety scare was a one off occurrence
9258579 i certainly thought our group responded bigtime from our performance against st kilda inside 50m entries were 57 so weve gone from 37 to 57 so hopefully that will continue
9258580 western bulldogs were a bit better than us early and until we adjusted to the wet conditions it looked like wed be in a bit of trouble but once we did that the fight of our playing group was just fantastic
9258581 both teams made a lot of mistakes which was expected in the wet and maybe just at crucial times they had a little more poise than we did at certain stages
9258582 it was the sort of game that was great for us going into the finals against a very competitive side and we certainly thought we held our own
9258583 i am someone who is concerned about the quality and diversity of our media market
9258584 theres never been an industrial dispute in this country that wasnt solved by talking
9258585 plainly peter costello is a very superior political talent mr abbott told abc tv today
9258586 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9258587 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9258588 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy mr abbott said
9258589 i think we did make the right choice he said
9258590 what a significant number of the australian funds have been doing is to borrow at the listed fund level on the basis of future dealflows its leverage on leverage
9258591 the changes made to the business particularly our focus on being an alternative investment originator and asset manager in infrastructure will allow babcock amp brown to operate in the current market environment to build on its leading position in its key markets and position itself for ongoing earnings growth in future years
9258592 constituted inhumane treatment during the deprivation of her liberty and in disregard for her pain and suffering
9258593 through the acts and failures of state officials members of the victoria police force
9258594 un problema pol tico de fondo sin resolver en este pa s
9258595 ese problema sigue siendo real un problema que no se ha resuelto y yo considero personalmente que s lo se resolver a trav s del di logo y la negociaci n
9258596 un escenario de paz y democracia que le permita decidir su futuro y al mismo tiempo dentro de ese proceso se libere a todos los presos pol ticos vascos
9258597 she likes to have fun and have exercise and play
9258598 i try not to run her too hard in the days before the race to give her a little rest
9258599 and you know its great that its the u s open
9258600 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9258601 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9258602 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9258603 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9258604 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9258605 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9258606 there are no lights in there she cant go by herself
9258607 they said they were going to fix it but they never came back
9258608 they do anything and everything to get the tenants out
9258609 the super and the landlord deny us access to the building
9258610 hats off to their players and coaches for coming in and fighting
9258611 weve been preaching the run to him especially with the look western illinois was giving us rushing three and dropping eight guys back
9258612 we dont know why we are down the weather or the economy we see people coming but they are not spending money
9258613 the crowds are directly related to how hot it is
9258614 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9258615 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9258616 gulf of mexico and northern gulf coast should closely monitor the progress of gustav
9258617 a hurricane watch could be issued for portions of the northern gulf coast later today
9258618 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9258619 i beg you to have mercy and return my daughter
9258620 its very different from in the past when you had a low year and you tended to rebound we havent been doing that anymore
9258621 i guess the main thing people should understand is this is just a continuation of that long term downward trend i think whether or not we break the record its just the continuation of what weve been seeing since 2002 where every year were losing ice and were not recovering at all
9258622 you had a lot of things that happened together that caused a lot of ice loss
9258623 but had that perfect storm happened say in the 1970s you probably wouldnt have lost so much ice like you did last year and the key thing seems to be the ice is just becoming really thin and its that much more vulnerable to natural variability
9258624 its scary its such a huge change thats happening very quickly and it makes me very sad because i just cant see how the species that rely on the ice can survive this
9258625 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9258626 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9258627 he has been co operating with investigators and weve had the opportunity to sit down with him and get his version of the events
9258628 it just was a straight shot straight down the lane he hit the curb and flew through the window
9258629 there was blood everywhere and there were bodies all over the place
9258630 i went in to see if i could help there was nothing that could be done for anyone in the front of the store
9258631 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9258632 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9258633 thank you president mubarak for letting us return home before ramadan
9258634 we thank egyptian president hosni mubarak for opening the crossing today and we hope the opening days will be extended
9258635 are we ready to elect the most inexperienced candidate of our times
9258636 i wanted to see if it would get better but i didnt think it would
9258637 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9258638 and it is warm not something im really used to
9258639 the fans like it the fans are used to it were going to keep doing it
9258640 im sure they said the same thing about bullet bob hayes
9258641 but if you thought a guy with that much raw talent could help your team youd have to take a look at him i wouldnt be surprised if a team gave him a tryout
9258642 i wanted to do that with michael jordan one time when i was out in san francisco
9258643 with his height and his wingspan i wanted to get him out there for football practice this was when he was out of basketball and he was out there i thought boy hed make a good looking wide receiver but he was too smart
9258644 well start the boarding process now with our first class customers
9258645 if youre bringing on people who need assistance younger kids all at once you potentially create a bottleneck on the front end
9258646 one vehicle was traveling west at a high rate of speed and went off the road and struck a tree on the passenger side
9258647 it looked like they left the roadway right before coming to highway 332 and skidded sideways
9258648 i remained in the solution for approximately 18 hours and was delivered on april 6 1977 at 6am in a californian abortion clinic a nurse called an ambulance while the abortionist was not yet on duty
9258649 a saline abortion is a solution of salt saline that is injected into the mothers womb it burns the baby inside and out and then the mother is to deliver a dead baby this happened to me
9258650 it has been fascinating to watch the tight collaboration between them
9258651 he wasnt going to let anyone ghost it for him every paragraph went back and forth between costello and coleman line by line word by word
9258652 salt water from the waterfalls can cause leaves to discolor or fall off prematurely
9258653 parks has advised that with proper care any potential adverse effects can be limited
9258654 will continue to monitor the condition of the affected trees
9258655 but it didnt happen quite the way everyone seems to believe
9258656 we are deeply concerned by reports that workers at the factory where the raid occurred were segregated by race or ethnicity and interrogated the factory was locked down for several hours workers were denied access to counsel and ice failed to inform family members and lawyers following the raid where the workers were being jailed
9258657 churches legal services groups and humanitarian organizations have already sprung into action to address the human costs in terms of children left without a parent breadwinners plucked from their jobs limited access to lawyers and truncated due process for detainees
9258658 we didnt need this it literally blew our town away
9258659 when communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids when nursing mothers are torn from their babies when children come home from school to find their parents missing when people are detained without access to legal counsel when all that is happening the system just isnt working and we need to change it
9258660 its going to be sad at the end of the sixth grade you graduate and she wont be with us
9258661 whenever you were sad she would try to cheer you up
9258662 the question is what was happening with those other four guys on the court when lance is on the court five percent of the game is played with the ball in your hands the other 95 is played without the ball in your hands lance had to work on that we try to implement the team concept of passing more than dribbling that was something other players got better and better at it was a very difficult decision
9258663 positioning st kitts and nevis for competitiveness over the next 25 years the role of the diaspora
9258664 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9258665 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9258666 what makes this situation different from what happened three years ago is that the state has pre positioned commodities and resources like food and water ready to roll once this thing hits
9258667 its been quiet for a few years and were hoping people havent become apathetic
9258668 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9258669 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9258670 people pay a small one off joining fee and then they can hire any of our cars by the hour or day depending on what they want
9258671 dont want to be lumbered with the expense of keeping one on the road all year round
9258672 im sure petrol prices have played a part in our growth but it also comes down to the convenience of having a car when you want without the hassle of full time ownership
9258673 as an independent when youre scraping it out like we are you want everybody to think its their movie
9258674 if theres less than a minute of stuff before you get to your movie i dont think anybody really worries about that
9258675 they want to make a splash and be memorable and its a challenge as the logo sequence gets fatter and fatter
9258676 everybodys got a different story or memory from their childhood thats going to make the logo personal
9258677 when we went in to phoenix pictures mike medavoy said i always liked that shot in lawrence of arabia where he lights the match and it cross dissolves to the sun so the logo starts out that way
9258678 the idea was to create a sense of community not only for an audience but also as a place for filmmakers to come to
9258679 they have a pecking order that depends on whos executive producing the movie whose production company is most involved
9258680 we didnt have a lot of money for a big splashy logo
9258681 i love the idea of that logo having an effect on a kid watching the movie the way the amblin or lucasfilm or disney logos did on me when i was a kid
9258682 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9258683 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9258684 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9258685 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9258686 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9258687 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9258688 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9258689 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9258690 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9258691 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9258692 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9258693 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9258694 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9258695 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them
9258696 they are desperate because of defeats along the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9258697 there was big sound and people screamed and ran in all directions i saw several people covered with blood lying on the ground
9258698 you gotta make as much money as you can because when we shut down and were gonna shut down thats it for a long while
9258699 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9258700 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess
9258701 our boss was into playing his trumpet down here more than he was into running a business so that all kinda went to hell and now im working here
9258702 ive never been through one and im not sure what to believe you see the national weather people and theyre telling you its gonna be really bad
9258703 i dont leave for nothing i didnt even leave for katrina
9258704 i mean look at the local weather guys they know what theyre doing not those weather channel people the local people say its gonna move north and thats enough for me
9258705 lot of folks around here are gonna make do with what they have and you wont hear a terrible amount of complaining
9258706 you cant just come in here and expect to hear people fussing about how they dont have nothing people just be used to not having much and so you dont even think too hard about it until someone starts asking you questions
9258707 now what do you think that would look like me and my little car sitting there in traffic with two big old rottweilers
9258708 guess im just gonna wait i just dont know its all stressful
9258709 its hard to explain to someone whos not from here why anyone would choose to stay
9258710 as long as i have power im good probably wont have power for long but this place is pretty tough
9258711 when you stand out there by that river and look at that levee
9258712 you are just so blessed to live here i am in love and so i make my choice
9258713 the play fell off in 07 and we just havent seen a lot of change thus far this year
9258714 its kind of a hard decision to make but it is the decision we made at this point and well go forward
9258715 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9258716 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing i thought i was competing for the job and i thought i showed that even after the injuries of last year that i can play and i can practice
9258717 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9258718 i believe in our quality and i think we got our fans back with this performance
9258719 when we all play together like that and show our spirit we have a chance to win
9258720 it was very important to show that if we play like this we have a lot of chances to win something
9258721 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9258722 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9258723 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9258724 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9258725 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife major general jeffery told sky news
9258726 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9258727 i feel comfortable in my own skin that the ship of state is on course and people are very nice to us wherever we go he said
9258728 i was once like you i used to ride motorcycles and do all that stuff
9258729 i dont want you doing that i need you alive so we can finish these episodes
9258730 i am definitely somebody who has grown up around objects and things
9258731 i think the fun and the journey of mommas man is what if you checked out what would be the reality of actually trying to step back in that place and visiting his best friend hunting down his old girlfriend
9258732 i think the movie is about him coming to grips with the idea that there are certainly things to be treasured in the loft but there is also a new reality for him
9258733 that is how its always been and it is how i like to visit
9258734 it is a place i want to document and hold on to i knew i wanted to shoot the place
9258735 i am so extremely thankful because they were game and they did it for me
9258736 it was pretty easy and interesting to watch people making a movie and our son being wonderfully relaxed humorous and enjoying what was going on
9258737 margaret thatcher shut down pretty much all the coal mining industry which was really the basis of the community
9258738 but i recently went on youtube and looked up billingham and saw someone driving around in a car looking at the town center and the architectures amazing
9258739 i had just come off king kong and flags of our fathers and felt like i much more belonged in that independent world
9258740 i was desperate to work with a director who would be very hands on with me and know the character better than i did so david mackenzie was the perfect person for that
9258741 it deals with very many dark subjects but david brought this incredible lightness to it as well comedy elements theres a sweetness which i think the film really needed and also it was the first time id explored myself sexually on screen especially because of young adam mackenzie definitely does it in a way thats very visceral very alive with energy
9258742 i dont think its going to gross 40 million in its opening weekend
9258743 even in england to some extent it was thats really pushing boundaries but i enjoy that it played very well in germany
9258744 loved it really loved it working six day weeks freezing scotland
9258745 because my first film billy elliot was such a collaborative small communal experience thats what ill always prefer rather than bigger things if youre a mechanism in a big machine of course you care and you put your energy into it but its not the same as if you are the machine
9258746 defiance as much as its not an action movie theres still a lot of guns in it that part of it was incredible
9258747 its a drama about surviving and sacrifice but just seeing him do that i was like id love to do that as a job its a stretch billy elliot as an action hero
9258748 many of these students didnt realize they had the capacity for bigger things
9258749 i got in trouble back in my wilder younger days
9258750 one of those continuation schools you know where you can do what you want they just give you a packet and send you in a corner
9258751 you cant just sit there and expect your schoolwork to get done youve got to move your pencil
9258752 not everyone was texting each other and taking their phones everywhere and iming
9258753 what e mail has done to relationships i think it has ruined high school you used to have to go to a girl and talk to her they text now its a different world and all of that stuff is great for stories
9258754 were trying to make it reflective of what kids really do and what its really like
9258755 our version is a little dirtier and edgier but its also going to show that despite how much money these kids come from essentially they want to be popular and liked its all the same emotions whether you grew up working class in michigan or upper class in beverly hills
9258756 trust me your concerns about sachs judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyones having including jeff and i
9258757 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9258758 there are so many things that are very important now that didnt exist eight years ago
9258759 when you look at the old show the characters look very outdated and the fashion is outdated so theres a new version to do but what i loved the most about redeveloping the show was having people from a different part of the country move to beverly hills and contemporizing that point of view
9258760 ive been doing this for a long time and ive never seen quite the amount of attention that this network has been getting from gossip girl and 90210
9258761 i think theres something to be said about being a part of pop culture right now and building assets for our parent companies theres got to be a new way of measuring viewers because our viewers are much younger and they consume content differently
9258762 were used to doing shows that a couple of years later people say oh i saw that on dvd and that it was really good
9258763 were not used to people knowing exactly what we did until two years after its been canceled
9258764 the old show was great because it put issues out there but the way that it handled it was very after school special
9258765 you had the walsh family always at home ready to listen to their problems and give them snacks in this show the parents have their own lives and their own drama and its just more realistic
9258766 you think its all glitz and glam and everybodys rich
9258767 but people have some secrets and they hide them you get to see the lives of real people and how they adapt to somewhere as beautiful and as ugly as beverly hills
9258768 gabe and jeff have so much to say about their own coming of age stories
9258769 its something they really enjoy writing and its evident in the script
9258770 i felt the difference in the game was who would rush the ball better
9258771 we wanted to wear them down and we wanted to wear them out we didnt do it by much but im telling you a one point difference in any sporting event makes a huge difference
9258772 we felt coming into the game that it would be like that and in the second half we didnt have good enough field position to make plays
9258773 i think they might have started getting a little worn out by the end there
9258774 our guys were kind of getting momentum and we were running the ball great
9258775 dear god please keep the rain away tonight tomorrow would be fine i know we need the rain thanks karissa
9258776 i dont care if other states banned smoking or not its killing a lot of businesses
9258777 the state should have given neighborhood taverns the option to go smoking or nonsmoking we have several nonsmoking customers who had no problems coming here
9258778 my place was a working mans bar where people want to sit down chat with friends and have a cigarette
9258779 now people are thinking should i go in and spend 3 for a bottle of beer or spend 16 for a 30 pack and smoke at home
9258780 the second we closed we lost everything that was grandfathered in and they just want too much done with the electricity plumbing and getting the bathrooms up to code for handicapped accessible use
9258781 we tried to get enough money to pay off all of our bills and walk off into the sunset by selling the place but it didnt happen
9258782 no sea que se pierda y no se pueda hacer la cord
9258783 sin n mero para no quitar la plaza a otro paternero
9258784 pero tratamos de conseguir que los tiradores vayan rotando y otras muchas cosas
9258785 es especial porque se conjuga el espect culo con el arte y la pasi n
9258786 muchas personas han de trabajar como una sola es un
9258787 the business model is akin to microsoft you invest a lot of time and money developing the technology and now it is a question of tweaking it and drawing the royalties
9258788 our numbers are based entirely on these existing three licences
9258789 we did not own the intellectual property for the instruments we were selling so there was only so much money we could ever make the way to make a lot of money is to have technology that other people want and very slowly we began to start work preparing a drug delivery division
9258790 in common with other retailers we are always looking to where we source from and vietnam is one of the countries we are looking to
9258791 by 2009 we anticipate significant inflationary pressures in many important sourcing markets not least china
9258792 i dont anticipate any drastic changes inflation there will be less than 5 per cent but china will become a more expensive place to manufacture
9258793 people have got carried away with that in the past and i dont think thats right
9258794 that actually says we wont just make profits but we will look at how people are treated
9258795 go the extra mile to give a chance to people who might look like they have some potential
9258796 do you know that 42 per cent of surplus products at companies simply go to landfill
9258797 its a wonderful way to redistribute things big companies dont need
9258798 the crucial thing in america is getting across these three tiers
9258799 the zeal of sir cliff richard with the determination of lord coe
9258800 youve got to get past 1bn to be anyone serious and then the larger tier operations are 2bn and upwards this will put us slap bang in the middle we can bid our way to becoming a tier one operator
9258801 the ons is an organisation under extreme pressure being forced to relocate to newport and then subjected to significant cost cuts now it looks as if it cant cope
9258802 mongrel groups which make no sense in terms of industrial structure
9258803 our retail statistics are based on a survey of 5 000 retailers every single month including over 4 000 small and medium sized firms in the uk the brc samples around 100 firms and doesnt have very good coverage of small firms and internet retailers
9258804 i believe that our national accounts are up there at the top in the world when the economy is changing and at the moment its slowing down it is very difficult to be absolutely right in very short notices
9258805 it seems strange that when figures are bad they are also often late late or inaccurate statistics only go to further undermine this governments credibility
9258806 the springboks got into the game they built momentum and we dropped off it and thats what happens at this level
9258807 the springboks are world champions someone has to be bottom of the table it doesnt mean youre not a good side
9258808 weve already seen in this tournament how little it takes to go from being a victor and enjoying the experience to a loser and not enjoying the experience
9258809 i guess whats evident is how much it took us to lift the mandela silverware so weve achieved something and weve got the opportunity to go on and achieve more so well hang on to that
9258810 weve got the opportunity now to regroup and get back and focus on what is a fantastic opportunity in brisbane
9258811 im here to apologise firstly to our supporters and secondly to shannon grants family and his supporters
9258812 it was a disgraceful effort today and it all comes down to effort required and it was non existent
9258813 that was one of the things that we spoke about all week the effort and again we spoke about last nights game and the effort required and today it was just non existent
9258814 its a mental application and about your desire to work hard within your role and your team role
9258815 weve blown an opportunity to finish fourth but we have another opportunity in the finals
9258816 some of the guys who have served us so well have been on a slippery dip and some of the guys who have performed poorly today and who performed poorly last week make themselves vulnerable
9258817 do we take them edwards and mcintosh into a finals series probably not being match hardened
9258818 thats the question we have to look very closely at and pick the best side to win a final
9258819 its important to be able to realign yourself refocus and get yourself ready
9258820 we got absolutely smashed in free kicks around the stoppages
9258821 were not blaming anyone were just saying its a fact we need to spend more time with the umpiring department because i think we have had 90 free kicks the wrong way this year
9258822 it will be backed by a 100 million funding program over three years for economic and social infrastructure in regional and rural communities in key mining areas ms bligh said
9258823 projects may include new or upgraded roads schools and health facilities
9258824 qrc and its members have lobbied strongly to ensure that the needs of communities in regions such as the bowen and surat basins and north west queensland are recognised and rewarded through tangible returns such as improved community services mr roche said
9258825 education revolution saying labor would withhold funding from the states unless they introduced league tables for schools
9258826 i think we can all think of pockets of disadvantage in major cities and in regional centres and theyre the kind of areas we want to assist ms gillard told network ten
9258827 were absolutely focused on making sure every school in this country is a great school
9258828 joel kleins model has made a difference to those pockets of poverty and disadvantage ms gillard said
9258829 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
9258830 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
9258831 i fought hard to save this little boys life but nobody would help me
9258832 so i was fighting a fight by myself which ended with me losing my grandson and my daughter where she is now
9258833 i loved this baby more than anything in my life
9258834 for him to die the way he died is eating up my heart
9258835 just because i wasnt there the whole time that i wasnt there to help him to save him
9258836 i want to protect you from all harm but i have to let you grow and learn on your own
9258837 remember no matter what whether things are good or bad i want you to know youre my son and i love you forever and ever
9258838 we would not like to think that it was the will of god what happened to this boy
9258839 i would like to think that this boy died for us this baby has left a message here for the whole world
9258840 there are family pictures of me at pre school that i cant really remember where im doing michael jackson routines wearing a black leotard a slightly embarrassed linder said
9258841 someone asked me the other day how angry i was after theyd seen me rehearse linder says with a laugh
9258842 im not angry at all my work is very ideas driven and i hope within my work i try to create a dialogue
9258843 id like to work in berlin one day he said
9258844 theres a long history and interest in dance there and progression in theatre and performance
9258845 id also like to develop my work in australia and get involved in the scene there
9258846 you have given me and my family more you have given your people and this country more than you will ever know
9258847 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9258848 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9258849 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9258850 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9258851 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9258852 presento dos colecciones al a o y sol a hacer tambi n dos spots al a o

9258859 i cant share 23 years with you in five minutes
9258860 even at age five or six he still wanted to fight he still wanted to make a difference
9258861 when i think of tony i hear the kid with the speech impediment who couldnt say grilled cheese
9258862 every time he got hurt his guys were there for him
9258863 i can truly understand why hed never want to leave them behind
9258864 tonys view of his mission was simple it was to stop people from killing americans
9258865 were going to miss tony more than we can say
9258866 everybody was friendly and left happy even if their attempt didnt turn out the way they had hoped
9258867 both groups are not for profit organizations who rely heavily on volunteers who appreciate and are interested in horses
9258868 its such a great program that has brought strength balance and fun into my life
9258869 our riders enjoy volunteering because it gives them the best seats in the house
9258870 they get to be up close and personal at the events and gain insight into the previous lives of our program horses
9258871 its unusual to see horses jumping over logs and water
9258872 take a hands on approach to assure the highest quality of service to their customers
9258873 we have a high population of persons with disabilities senior citizens and lower income individuals who have health problems without the health care to treat those problems its not right for them to have to deal with secondhand smoke
9258874 i think its an extremely wise move for them and their residents
9258875 once one housing authority in a state does this then its likely that others will follow
9258876 once the numbers come in well start working on a policy and maybe making one building smoke free first
9258877 i have to sit with a kleenex over my face because sometimes the smoke coming in is so heavy
9258878 im getting bronchitis from it and my voice goes in and out there are other residents who have breathing problems and heart problems i dont want other people to go through what im going through so im fighting this its for all of us
9258879 twenty percent to 60 percent of the air in apartments comes from other units
9258880 it dilutes itself and gets everywhere theres a lot of ways that air is shared
9258881 the walls turn yellow from all the nicotine and tar
9258882 you have to paint two or three times to cover it everywhere you go its going to cost you more to deal with people that smoke when youre rehabbing units
9258883 they are taking people who cant fight back and bullying them
9258884 its becoming increasingly common and they housing authorities have a perfect right to do so
9258885 its a fire safety thing its a huge health issue i would think that more and more housing authorities would be moving in this direction its very popular to have clean air
9258886 it was a little bit extra special because growing up a cubs fan it was special beating the white sox
9258887 i think it was inevitable because my heart was pounding pretty hard
9258888 early on he threw a lot of fastballs as he got into his game he started using his changeup and his breaking ball hes got enough on his fastball and hes got some deception
9258889 hes throwing from his ear and he gets some downward angle on that fastball i thought he composed himself really well and competed he did a good job
9258890 he didnt really impress me he just beat a team right now that isnt swinging the bats well the first inning he threw all fastballs we have a fastball hitting team and we didnt get him when you deserve credit ill give you credit he didnt impress me he was good enough to beat the white sox tonight
9258891 they were very welcoming when i got to the clubhouse they talked to me and made me feel comfortable
9258892 it has become the premier teaching event in the kingdom
9258893 its a romantic bunch of people having fun with recreating a different time
9258894 i enjoy the costumes and the skills needed to create these
9258895 they just said ive been better with the extra day
9258896 i dont make the rules here i just follow them ill just go out and pitch the best i can on that second day
9258897 during the long grind of the season any extra day you can get youll take it
9258898 with that being said my ultimate goal was to get 200 innings or around there and im not there yet i want the ball as much as they will give it to me they wanted to push me back a day and im totally fine with that
9258899 i think center fielder jerry owens we talk about owens we talk about josh fields chris getz the third catcher
9258900 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9258901 this is the real deal this is not a test
9258902 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9258903 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9258904 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9258905 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9258906 every time hes gotten an opportunity here weve liked what weve seen from him
9258907 he has a strong arm hes picking up the offense now we like him
9258908 i feel like ive done everything i can and ive made enough plays to get peoples attention
9258909 im just trying to get my foot in the door i think ive taken a pretty big step and improved on the little aspects of the game like mechanics
9258910 i know the offense a lot better than i did
9258911 it lets me know that i can play in this league i feel like i did what i could do and i want to prove that i can do more
9258912 he had a very good training camp hes played well in every game and hes definitely piqued our interest at least mine anyway
9258913 its just a way of showing people who fly their flags that we support them
9258914 if you fly a flag well clean it for free
9258915 but dry cleaning definitely will extend the longevity of it
9258916 sometimes we do them behind the post just ourselves sometimes we get scout groups that want us to show them how we do it
9258917 that was one thing that attracted a lot of people a lot of the adults that were buying the homes had small children so it was a good place to have the kids be able to play
9258918 the screen door blew off every time we put it on
9258919 i didnt like being locked up in a box in a house where you cant get outside this was perfect
9258920 buffalo grove has just about everything to offer now where when i was a child growing up i had to go elsewhere
9258921 i think it was a pretty quiet friendly town and it still is
9258922 mark would be a very good acquisition he has been an extremely consistent performer with the cowboys over the last couple of years
9258923 he is strong powerful and is a very experienced centre with a good reputation within the nrl
9258924 hes also very versatile and can play full back and wing
9258925 were hoping to have things sorted out pretty soon we would like to bring him to salford because he would be an ideal signing
9258926 it will be a long season for these guys but it will be a great honour for them to be involved in the world cup
9258927 there is a willingness by the sector to look after its own
9258928 the history of the sector has always been that a society close to getting in trouble has sought a merger with another society
9258929 weathered the storm comparatively well so far the second longer and slower paced round of the credit crunch is now under way this poses more problems for societies
9258930 it is inevitable there will be more consolidation as market conditions worsen
9258931 i do think there will mergers but when will be hard to tell
9258932 to batten down the hatches and ensure they are in good shape for the difficult market conditions still to come
9258933 we expect dsgs performance to have continued to deteriorate since q4
9258934 the upcoming newsflow should confirm the pain of increasingly challenged uk shoppers
9258935 we are working on the innate belief that delivering ethical products to the market is something consumers are willing to pay premium prices for
9258936 the consumer likes to become an armchair specialist whether it is about their watch movement or the hilltop chateau where they get their favourite bordeaux
9258937 nearly all traditional investments are falling in value but the interest in stars like madonna is undiminished and their value keeps increasing
9258938 aon has more casualty business in the us and benfield more property catastrophe work and we see a tremendous opportunity when we put the two together
9258939 irrespective of how pricing moves around our clients are living in a riskier world and they want more service
9258940 hermes has been notified of staff concerns regarding the long term underperformance staff are also in communication with all other external partners on a regular basis and concerns for underperformance are addressed as needed
9258941 the portfolio of greatest concern is the hermes focus asset management portfolio
9258942 the funds have been hit by somewhat abnormal market conditions in which a number of stocks have reacted violently on no news we are confident the funds will recover we still have a good relationship with calpers and there is no suggestion that the relationship will be terminated they are not happy with the performance and nor are we
9258943 the decision has been made for brazoria county not to evacuate
9258944 people can enjoy their labor day but stay informed because things could change unexpectedly
9258945 we had a gradual a rise in sales over the last four years but this spike is due to a tightening of the economy
9258946 the preferred option is not to sell any of it unless they cannot raise enough from external investors
9258947 potentially yes i am not an expert on cartel issues but there is always a risk when you come together
9258948 imagine if the boot was on the other foot and landlords got together to demand a change in terms or an increase in rents from their tenants there would be uproar i cant see that this is so different
9258949 this is a pretty flimsy argument for two reasons firstly in the context of the scale of the leasing market in the uk retail only represents a small percentage and secondly landlords are already doing lots of deals for retailers to pay their rents monthly

9258962 they tried their best to do what they could but they ended up pronouncing him dead
9258963 i was able to run in front and block the pass
9258964 i was one on one with the keeper and placed it in the corner
9258965 i thought the should have had four in the first eight minutes
9258966 we spotted a team that starts 10 seniors two goals im more than happy
9258967 to take this lose with a bunch young kids and progress throughout the season i dont need a first place trophy a loss is a loss but being so young we have to progress
9258968 its always nice to win a tournament but we look at every game as a challenge
9258969 every game in itself is a small tournament thats the approach we take
9258970 the knights got on the board first when santiago tovar converted a penalty kick 15 minutes in
9258971 we cant care about whats going on up on the scoreboard but you have to care about whats going on out on the field
9258972 i think this is going to be a real problem for us
9258973 that thing is almost all ash trees end to end
9258974 i dont see why on any given night we cant compete with any team especially with the talent we have i wouldnt be surprised with anything we accomplish and im expecting to accomplish a lot this year
9258975 without him i dont think id be playing volleyball i saw him playing when i was really young and i liked it he just taught me how to play we played in the backyard a lot he taught me at least he tried
9258976 theyve both really been great leaders in practice so far helping the other girls out
9258977 theyre always positive and theyre two of my hardest workers even though theyre two of the best players we have
9258978 i thought it was a good opportunity to go for the varsity job
9258979 so i got a hold of the athletic director dan kallenbach and talked to him about it he eventually hired me
9258980 im real excited its my first year of varsity but i think i can bring a lot to the table i think i know a lot about volleyball but overall this will be a great learning experience we have a great group of girls so i expect pretty good things from this team
9258981 oh my gosh i like him a lot like a lot a lot
9258982 i think hes doing really good things i think were going to be pretty good
9258983 he has a completely different style he trains us and conditions us and everything hes super laid back he doesnt believe in yelling at least i havent heard him yell yet when we do drills and make mistakes hell teach you that you have to do it right to get rewarded
9258984 im really excited for bartlett because i think were really going to be able to finally do something good
9258985 this is a very unique and great opportunity to pivot around and move forward to have a real strong 2010 here in illinois
9258986 there is no question the republican organization got comfortable and there is no question that due to failures in leadership people got turned off to the party
9258987 in 2010 i think it can be a lot better for us
9258988 we are playing defense right now that is the bottom line
9258989 i think he is a good example of the contrast with our own past
9258990 i know a lot of parties and social events are planned for minnesota which is fine
9258991 but i am hoping we also will be taking time and spending resources on working to win elections
9258992 trying to watch all the political stuff i want to be prepared its a big responsibility representing nine counties ive been all over the district to meet people and theyre all so warm and friendly
9258993 im curious to see what its like to be on the floor and have a delegates seat
9258994 i hope to come back with a lot of enthusiasm and ideas on how to support mccains campaign here in illinois
9258995 my brother and sister played volleyball but i told my parents i wanted to play basketball
9258996 i definitely want to try to be a vocal leader and leader by example
9258997 i basically dropped all other sports and focused on volleyball
9258998 i joined the 1st alliance club in western springs and that really made a difference
9258999 every summer a group of latvians get together in michigan and we play pickup volleyball games
9259000 there are four guys and two girls on each team the girls are usually the setters
9259001 ive definitely looked up to him since i was little
9259002 and my parents arnie and barb have always been so supportive with all my decisions they were really happy i chose bradley
9259003 i might look into physical therapy or along those lines
9259004 its amazing how high she can get she touches 9 foot 10 that alone gives her such an advantage over the closest blockers plus she has the natural hitting strength and timing to place the ball where she wants that makes her tough to stop
9259005 winning conference back to back years is quite an accomplishment
9259006 im hoping we can defend our title when mr tiller came here two years ago we knew we had to take things seriously he knows how to choose the right athletes and makes us work hard im hoping this is another good year
9259007 with almost the entire team coming back were looking to get into double digits for wins
9259008 were building our way up from the point where we were a couple of years ago every year were trying to make progress
9259009 its a really big deal having the senior leaders on the team that we do
9259010 shes quick and has a great feel for the game
9259011 we have a lot of continuity together as a team
9259012 we really have been able to work on our serve receive and our defense
9259013 id like to see the most improvement with running a quicker offense
9259014 with mostly everybody returning i think we have a good chance to get better
9259015 after next week with our first match and our first tournament well figure out who we are and what we need to do and go from there
9259016 i dont know what were all about yet well see what our strengths are in actual matches and well see what are weaknesses are and well go from there
9259017 everybody is ready to step in and play their position this is a great group of girls they are humble and they are willing to learn they are very coachable im looking forward ot this year we will compete
9259018 weve started off strong they have the heart and they have the drive and they have good ball control our ball control is more advanced
9259019 weve spent a lot of time working on how to play well out of system
9259020 i think our defense will be a strength these girls are nimble and quick
9259021 we will focus a lot on how to be more of an offensive weapon
9259022 i told them i didnt want them to get discouraged because the teams we play and the strength of our schedule only prepares us for the state championship
9259023 we play the best of the best when we go down to effingham there are always two or three state champions in the tournament its so strong but we always hold our own then theres our conference i told them i dont mind losing if were learning where we need to improve and building character
9259024 were going to have a decent block and we have people who can put the ball away i believe were going to dig some balls but our passing has been a little shaky so were going to have to improve
9259025 were super young with three freshmen and three sophomores but i think we can still be pretty good
9259026 this could be the best serving team ive ever had we serve really aggressively itll come down to everyone playing their roles everybody fitting in and accepting their roles and continuing to work on ball control
9259027 the nice thing is weve got the wehrs sisters who have experience playing on varsity since they were freshmen
9259028 the expectations are very high on them they took on leadership roles last year as sophomores so its not going to be anything new for them as juniors
9259029 this year we may not be as tall but were quick and the offense were going to run this year is probably the quickest weve run
9259030 everyone knows the system and has more experience so it should be a really fun offense
9259031 im really hoping to get more than 2 wins in our conference were fast and spunky i think we can be a thorn in the side of the top teams in our conference
9259032 weve been focusing on using erin to her full potential
9259033 shes very versatile if i tell her to hit a certain zone the very next ball thats where she hits it shes done a great job of taking on a leadership role
9259034 i talk with this team all the time about effort
9259035 i want them to give 100 percent effort all the time and well let the chips fall where they may
9259036 we do have a really good balance between youth and experience
9259037 and our youth has experience at the club level so were hoping that will help out a lot were really working on serve and serve receive were hoping to be more aggressive in those areas we want to come back and be a little stronger this year
9259038 katie really improved a lot over the winter and im looking for her to be a leader
9259039 a host of new faces will attempt to keep the momentum rolling at dundee crown following after last years respectable third place finish in the rugged valley division of the fox valley conference including mosher
9259040 losing the players we did hurt this is really not a very experienced group this is definitely a rebuilding year for us
9259041 viewers want to see firsthand what there is to do in the region they are about to visit these videos give them a personal tour of attractions accommodations shopping venues dining options and more
9259042 the videos are light and fun but also extremely educational and interesting
9259043 video video video was the overwhelming subject of the conference and it being the leader of the new social networking onslaught
9259044 i wanted our bureau to stay ahead of the curve so we are moving forward by adding these videos to our already award winning web site
9259045 we arrested the duo based on the sisters complaint and are grilling them to get details about the other two
9259046 our meet started with a prayer for a long life for his holiness after which we will pray for the tibet freedom movement
9259047 we dont use violence and thats why our protest of 50 years has gone unnoticed
9259048 at the end of the month we will study the difference between the group that practiced yoga and the one that did not
9259049 while the young drivers are suffering from physical problems the older ones have mental fatigue
9259050 if anybody asked me i would say urenco is a jolly good business
9259051 not only have there been declines in the value of shares but also dividend incomes
9259052 this is a double whammy for people saving for their retirement people have less to put in together with insufficient and uncertain investment returns
9259053 it is the most difficult period that i can think of for pensions over the last 40 or 50 years
9259054 even in 2000 when you had a big stock market downturn interest rates and annuities were much healthier than they are now
9259055 it would be naive not to expect a slowdown and belt tightening in the current economic climate
9259056 we are often very quiet apart from the morning rush
9259057 i used to buy at least two coffees a day from chains like coffee republic but now as the price of just about everything is rocketing i have cut them out all together
9259058 i only treat myself to a coffee out on fridays during the week i stay at work for coffee as it is just too much of an extravagance when the cost of living is going up and up
9259059 sales are definitely down about 10pc the glory days of rapid coffee expansion are probably behind us over the last year starbucks costa and caff nero have added about 280 stores that sort of growth will not be repeated this year
9259060 we are doing everything we can so druzhba can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
9259061 we have worked for many years to gain not just the image but the status of a reliable energy supplier to europe and we would never let it suffer even in this political situation
9259062 people will think twice before making such a decision because it would be quite dangerous especially for the current economic situation
9259063 only a sick mind would think of cutting off europe
9259064 technically it is practically impossible since russian refineries are running at maximum rates and it is difficult to arbitrage right now
9259065 left us with some of the highest corporate tax rates in the european union
9259066 surveys by respected international bodies including the world bank and the world economic forum consistently show that the uk is successful at providing a business friendly environment and a competitive tax system
9259067 it is fair to say tax is an important consideration for us and we feel like we are doing the right thing
9259068 i think certainty of tax is crucial in business and what we want is for there to be no surprises luxembourg can offer that
9259069 london has to face up to the fact that the world has become a lot flatter and is much more competitive than it has ever been as our business model proves you can be based almost anywhere these days
9259070 there is too much uncertainty about the long term structure of the tax regime and the fact that so many other companies are looking at a move is a more eloquent testament to that than anything i could ever say
9259071 with companies leaving britain weakening an already ailing british economy i urge you to adopt our proposals in order to restore our competitiveness and help prevent any more companies from deciding to leave the uk
9259072 the business has continued to grow a long way into the housing market downturn at a time when newspaper property advertising has dropped dramatically
9259073 lettings is a boom business at the moment and housebuilders are working harder than ever to achieve sales
9259074 most estate agents and sellers are now busy reducing prices the quicker that happens the quicker we will get to the bottom of the market however things like the governments prevarication over stamp duty does not help
9259075 the american auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees
9259076 but i honestly cant recall branson giving any personal interviews on the price fixing activities of his company
9259077 bradford amp bingley afp officials in south ossetia say russia to absorb it
9259078 this is a difficult time for most financial services firms and new star is no exception
9259079 we do not expect conditions to improve significantly in the immediate future
9259080 we are concerned that uk pub profitability will continue to come under pressure in the next 12 months due to the consumer slowdown and inflationary pressures
9259081 given the poor outlook on household spending for 2009 we were overly optimistic to expect a return to growth in the sector next spring
9259082 our sector rating remains reduce and we downgrade enterprise inns mitchells amp butlers marstons and greene king from hold to reduce
9259083 another year of excellent progress on earnings cashflow and returns
9259084 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
9259085 we are doing everything we can so druzhba the main oil pipeline to europe can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
9259086 its big for us but its even bigger for our community back there in eastern north carolina
9259087 its a top program like virginia tech a good team a real good team
9259088 thats what the offense has to do it has to execute everybody did their job
9259089 i thought the snap was a little bit soft and i think the kick was a little bit slow
9259090 the guy just broke through on our protection and he did a nice job
9259091 you know what the saying is defense wins championships and offense sells tickets
9259092 coach told us from the get go that it was going to be two battles of the defense that was just team camaraderie how we stuck together throughout
9259093 i am satisfied it has strengthened my hand tremendously nobody but a fool would disregard the kind of result we witnessed today
9259094 no matter how unpalatable at first sight we will give them very careful thorough consideration and investigation before attempting to pass judgement
9259095 planchas de acero taquillas de metal para guardar cosas todo tipo de botellas de cristal y latas que algunos tripulantes coleccionan debido a que proceden de una gran variedad de nacionalidades etc
9259096 ensucia el pescado y se pierde una parte de la captura

9259098 we lined up t j lee a senior he had made some mistakes earlier in the game i had been riding him hard i know he was frustrated because he wanted to get back in there he went in there and changed the course of the game
9259099 i got on the head set and i told coach todd fitch to get a two minute play ready
9259100 we are going to stop them on offense and we are going to need to get that ball back we were trying to be real selective about when we used our timeouts
9259101 i didnt see the blocked punt until i heard it
9259102 by the time i realized it was getting blocked it was too late when he picked it up there was no way i was going to catch him
9259103 those types of attitudes and performances are why you win close football games that is what happened today with t j lee i am proud of him
9259104 he is going to be a big part of it
9259105 we feel like we have got to get him on the field he keeps asking to put him on kickoff put him on punt block he is a very confident individual he is a very determined and committed young man
9259106 around 837 shopkeepers were prosecuted today for not having marathi signboards the maximum number of violations was registered in c ward kalbadevi at 104
9259107 they have talked to me about the 4 4 game not the league cup one mistake in the last two minutes meant they lost the premier league
9259108 i went out to question it because to be honest with you i wasnt sure and this is how tom handled it which i thought was pretty good i said tommy would you check because im not really sure but i think it might have been a fair ball
9259109 hallion said well ill check with the home plate umpire but i am positive it was a foul ball they conferred and they obviously either saw it the same way or nobody said anything he was only gonna check with the home plate umpire which i thought was fair the home plate umpire is looking at it right down the line
9259110 so i dont really know i cant really tell on the replay
9259111 we could see it pretty clear from where we were that unless it had had more height it definitely went on the left side of the foul pole and was foul
9259112 if they were going to have it i was hoping to be on the field the first time theyve used it but it was pretty clearly foul but its history you know
9259113 youd have to ask the umpire that question i might ask him that question myself
9259114 a few years ago the bmc used to be more pro active than it is now they slapped two notices on me because i had not put up the board in devnagri
9259115 these political parties are simply taking advantage of this bmc act
9259116 lettering name board in marathi devnagri shall not be less bold than any other language or script
9259117 its a tight spot when you walk the leadoff guy
9259118 as a pitcher i dont think we really ever want to intentionally walk anybody
9259119 thats not a mistake youve got to give the credit to jacobs
9259120 we do probably have to find out what can be a little bit more consistent in what were doing
9259121 thats just where we are thats just what we have to do
9259122 i guess he wasnt too happy that i hit him
9259123 were going to have to find a better offensive mix to keep putting runs on the board
9259124 weve got to find a way to keep adding runs
9259125 we have received similar complaints in the past but some of the stars have not lodged a complaint the stars who have lodged a formal complaints with us include paresh rawal and shamita shetty
9259126 right when it happened i raised my arm up i was thinking about a replay in the back of my mind at first
9259127 i was kind of hoping they would use it i wanted to be the first team
9259128 tell joe torre thank you for making me cut my hair
9259129 i go from first to third and i play defense
9259130 youve got 4 a players between triple a and the major leagues hes 5 a in his own category what goes unnoticed is the work that goes into it he gets up early works out on his own he doesnt tell anybody about it but he goes about his business and works hard its not a fluke theres a reason hes as good as he is
9259131 weve been beating ourselves tonight manny had an unbelievable game
9259132 basically manny he doesnt literally say this but its basically just follow me we didnt do anything early all of a sudden he hits the home run and it lightens the mood in the dugout because not only the fact he hit a home run but just his personality when he got back its pretty special its been really fun watching him from this side
9259133 we do something every day to make sure people understand that its not really important how bad weve been it doesnt take much to turn this thing around i learned in my st louis days as a player as long as there are more games left than youre behind you tell yourself you can win anything can happen it can turn around very quickly
9259134 like a lot of inexperienced players he tries to do too much at times but he straightens it out he reels himself in
9259135 if youre that good a player or youre that hot a hitter or you combine them both things like that happen
9259136 hes a great hitter thats seeing the ball hes covering the whole plate right now friday night he took a ball that almost hit him in the stomach and kept it fair thats when youre feeling good
9259137 its filling pretty big footsteps coming behind guys like jon lester clay buchholz
9259138 those are all great guys and theyve made their mark in the big leagues and its an honor just to follow them
9259139 i dont care what your age is getting runs is good
9259140 but he did a good job after we got the runs he made some pitches in key spots where if they get a hit all of a sudden the game gets tighter
9259141 just trying to get a good pitch to hit and hit it just trying to get on base thats my job sometimes you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times where you are good the last couple of days i got on base every time its just one of those things
9259142 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on the top of big brown to beat the white sox right now hes on a roll this guy right now is on fire
9259143 its important for any starting pitcher especially him in his first start give him a deep breath so he can relax
9259144 he got in some tough situations but he had presence to him and showed he could get through it thats huge for a young guy
9259145 it could have been a lot worse than it was but i made some pitches at the right time and luckily it worked out for the best
9259146 it was a little bit extra special because growing up a cubs fan it was special beating the white sox
9259147 thats great for the fans to think that but i just try to come out and play hard every day hopefully we can win thats all i care about
9259148 it was fun to be on the bottom of the pile
9259149 i got handled pretty good but i enjoyed every second
9259150 what hes done to come back and to win a ballgame like that is just huge for him huge for us and huge for the city
9259151 i just thought if we could somehow stop them for a minute we could come back
9259152 and hes setting a great example for the rest of the group
9259153 i was on first base and you almost feel the vibe
9259154 youre like ok something good is going to happen and look at that he hits a laser down the line we win the ballgame its the perfect story and its not over yet
9259155 i know that everybody feels especially happy for baldelli and yet from where im standing he looks really comfortable out there
9259156 we just got to play this one right and keep him strong and healthy and hes going to really contribute strong over this last month
9259157 but it makes it a little bit better that he got the winning hit
9259158 there were probably more people running at me but for some reason i can just picture b j and aki running right at me
9259159 and its a nice feeling something that ill remember for a while
9259160 led is very expensive but i see it as a one time expenditure which will eventually help reduce electricity bills
9259161 we have managed to track a few manufacturers of led in india but as these bulbs require high maintenance the technical know how would also have to be arranged for as the concept is new in the country we are yet to understand the maintenance aspects of led
9259162 even though led is more expensive than halogen lights the bmc has agreed to buy them but chances of led bulbs getting stolen are very high thieves will lay their hands on these lights as it is a known fact that these bulbs are expensive and arent easily available in the country if the move is not planned well it will fall flat like it happened in the case of plastic bins which got stolen the day they were placed
9259163 of the 4 000 hoardings in the city only 800 are illuminated and consume electricity the electricity consumption of these 800 hoardings is marginal with the new ruling outdoor hoarding companies have to invest in led bulbs and security arrangements and the end result will be that only around one per cent of the electricity will be saved
9259164 i regret not entering the long jump final but i tried believe me
9259165 i was playing great and he was playing great too
9259166 it actually isnt raining here at all and hasnt rained for about an hour and the wind is blowing quite strongly so the track is actually drying out
9259167 once my putt on eight missed that was the end of the dream
9259168 that hole was always going to be tough but i felt i hit a good par putt there
9259169 ive been hitting the ball nicely and today it was just strange i felt good all day i just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie
9259170 on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there was certainly a chance of 59
9259171 lauren ran a good race any time you win youre pleased with that
9259172 youre not looking to beat any type of record this year youre just looking to compete and when you win by that kind of margin youre doing a good job
9259173 noemi is getting back on track and she ran well
9259174 shes coming back for us this season and i have high expectations for her shes going to get in better condition and improve
9259175 we ran the course two weeks ago and a lot finished with a whole minute difference theyre a young group and have made a lot of improvement
9259176 its a high possibility this is the missing swimmer from a week ago
9259177 weve lost one game for the year and we were playing west coast and we won by nearly 100 points id say our boys are pretty hungry
9259178 i thought the guys who were on the fringe today played really well and that was the big challenge for them
9259179 shannon byrnes harry taylor brent prismall travis varcoe ryan gamble all those guys that people presume would be first out played a fantastic game and thats all they can do
9259180 the only thing you could probably say is were going to get a lot of votes winning 21 games out of 22
9259181 youd probably think that the geelong group of boys would get votes and i think theyll all poll
9259182 i think jimmy will poll obviously gary will and joel corey will and corey enright had an incredible patch there
9259183 were very excited now moving forward with what weve seen this year
9259184 a lot of our young players are still well short of being top line afl footballers but theyll be a lot better with our senior players back from injury around them and theyve shown a lot of excitement throughout the year
9259185 el servicio ha gozado de una aceptaci n importante de los usuarios teniendo en cuenta que agosto es el mes en el que utilizan el metro menos personas por la propia configuraci n de la l nea
9259186 we cannot allow perpetrators to remain among us if they do it to one dont worry it will come to your door as well if you know turn them in drop the dime on them
9259187 we need the cooperation of the people in this community
9259188 we need people to come forward and tell the police what they know about the crime thats going on around them criminals prey on fear they prey on silence
9259189 people have to work these and the people who are working them are saturated
9259190 we have to restore jobs hope and economic development so people have more to live for they see a future and know the city cares
9259191 i hit him with two strikes so i actually did him a favor
9259192 i would think that somebody would be smart enough to know that im not going to hit them with two strikes for what when i hit jorge cantu with two strikes in the fourth inning im sure he wasnt happy about it but he was smart enough to know there was no intent there
9259193 and when i said something to him it wasnt really about tonight being hit it was about the time at shea
9259194 if i wouldve thought that it was intentional it might have been different
9259195 he squared me up pretty good in a good place so i was just tired of it i didnt want to do anything or go out there i just wanted to let him know i wasnt just going to take it
9259196 youre messing with guys careers and i dont get a chance to retaliate
9259197 thats just one of those situations where whether it was on purpose or not im sure it wasnt we have a lot of passion when we play these guys over the last couple of years
9259198 i think he just might have gotten a little too far away to try to do the little shovel pass there
9259199 it happens its a play he makes a lot unfortunately that time it was just a little off target
9259200 it wasnt a lazy play its a play hes made probably 100 times
9259201 in that situation the throw was a little bit low but you cant say he was nonchalant or anything like that its a play that hes good at he works on it but in that situation it was a little bit off
9259202 robbie has that smoothness to him that people are going to assume that its nonchalant
9259203 robbie alomar was the same way he had a smoothness to him the way he played the game theyre not being nonchalant
9259204 they took advantage of the mistake youve got to give them credit
9259205 rasner did a tremendous job he pitched well and was cruising along we gave them extra outs and they scored extra runs and continued to score we had our opportunities
9259206 we had them down 6 2 and this is a game wed like to build on and blow them away
9259207 it really has i get in trouble and i try and do too much i just need to do what im capable of
9259208 you wish they dont capitalize on it the way they did
9259209 you win as a team and we lose as a team robbie had a great day offensively and hes been playing great defense its one of those plays that you wish you could take back
9259210 we are sending some members to meet the government panel and their mandate is to get the proposal which will then be placed before the core committee
9259211 more than a week has passed since we submitted our proposal and there was no decision from the government we would now like to see their proposal first and then decide
9259212 yuvraj has failed miserably in the series versus sri lanka and now he must think of a way out he must regain his form
9259213 previously he was getting dismissed in 30s and 40s and now it has come down to 20s only he can solve this problem by working harder at the nets and eradicating the mistakes that he has been committing recently
9259214 we will compile the data and findings and submit a memorandum to the state within a month we will push for the changes
9259215 we have also proposed for empowering the mci to perform a university grants commission like responsibility in prescribing service conditions placements and salary structures for the faculty which should again be reviewed periodically
9259216 what needs revamp is the infrastructure teaching and the learning process
9259217 a survey conducted by us showed that 98 per cent of the students considered the course duration to be too long again 125 of the 170 students in my college opted out of the medical officer job
9259218 trample upon the right of the citizens protected by the constitution
9259219 thakur threatened idris with dire consequences if he did not fulfil his demands he had asked for a plot on cst road in kurla where idris is developing a building under sra
9259220 we dont know how the case is under investigation at this point
9259221 i was pretty shaken up when i saw the handcuffs i didnt know if he had a gun or if he was going to strangle me with his cuffs
9259222 he jumped into a black lincoln navigator i got the license plate number and called the vernon hills police
9259223 it was 138 and he paid me 150 cash i wasnt going to take a check
9259224 we know who he is and we will catch him
9259225 everybody was friendly and left happy even if their attempt didnt turn out the way they had hoped
9259226 both groups are not for profit organizations who rely heavily on volunteers who appreciate and are interested in horses
9259227 its such a great program that has brought strength balance and fun into my life
9259228 our riders enjoy volunteering because it gives them the best seats in the house
9259229 they get to be up close and personal at the events and gain insight into the previous lives of our program horses
9259230 its unusual to see horses jumping over logs and water
9259231 we have a high population of persons with disabilities senior citizens and lower income individuals who have health problems without the health care to treat those problems its not right for them to have to deal with secondhand smoke
9259232 i think its an extremely wise move for them and their residents
9259233 once one housing authority in a state does this then its likely that others will follow
9259234 once the numbers come in well start working on a policy and maybe making one building smoke free first
9259235 i have to sit with a kleenex over my face because sometimes the smoke coming in is so heavy
9259236 im getting bronchitis from it and my voice goes in and out there are other residents who have breathing problems and heart problems i dont want other people to go through what im going through so im fighting this its for all of us
9259237 twenty percent to 60 percent of the air in apartments comes from other units
9259238 it dilutes itself and gets everywhere theres a lot of ways that air is shared
9259239 the walls turn yellow from all the nicotine and tar
9259240 you have to paint two or three times to cover it everywhere you go its going to cost you more to deal with people that smoke when youre rehabbing units
9259241 they are taking people who cant fight back and bullying them
9259242 its becoming increasingly common and they housing authorities have a perfect right to do so
9259243 its a fire safety thing its a huge health issue i would think that more and more housing authorities would be moving in this direction its very popular to have clean air
9259244 i think this is going to be a real problem for us
9259245 that thing is almost all ash trees end to end
9259246 barring andhra pradesh and tamil nadu not many states are coming up with new projects which can be implemented under this mission however maharashtra can do better than what is being done presently under this mission
9259247 however so far rs3757 crores have been sanctioned for different projects under jnnrum in maharashtra the state can also obtain funds under the basic services for urban poor but nothing much has been done the local bodies need to play a major part in implementing such projects the municipal corporation of greater mumbai mcgm has a budget of over rs16 000 crores however it is unfortunate that nothing concrete has been done by them to eradicate slums within city limits
9259248 two big real estate developers have approached us for building houses of 160sq feet under the scheme dharmesh jain of nirmal lifestyle has offered to build such houses at kalyan and dombivali videocon realities has offered to construct similar housing at vashinaka chemur and mahul
9259249 the city is in a little bit of a panic
9259250 kind of wherever you go every tv is turned to the news the news is now reporting nothing else other than the hurricane and its days away people are really heightened in terms of their emotions right now
9259251 thinking about the storm is anxiety provoking for people it brings them back to a lot of those feelings they had and memories from katrina
9259252 people have memories that are triggered by preparing for this storm
9259253 why did we return why did we rebuild why is this happening again to us all of those thoughts are going through peoples minds
9259254 in terms of the prep its great because i really think its going to be a different ball game than it was three years ago
9259255 throughout the country mental health is in crisis and in areas that are impoverished and recently devastated like new orleans they are certainly struggling
9259256 mental health wise absolutely not the number of providers is still far below whats needed
9259257 weve been on the ground since katrina and have been providing mental health and emotional recovery services
9259258 we have provided individual counseling visits to over a quarter million people and weve generated probably 2 5 million to 3 million contacts many people we see more than once the primary part of their work is meeting with survivors going to their neighborhoods homes community centers and educating people about emergency preparedness about coping with the recovery process about getting their homes and lives back together
9259259 were just trying to be as funny as possible and keep it in as light a mood as possible while were biting our nails were worrying amongst ourselves and eating junk food as relief
9259260 what were trying to do now is just communicate an expectation so that they know that effective communication in english is vital quite frankly im puzzled that this is an issue because we see this an an opportunity for our players
9259261 entr all buscas a tu pap le dec s lo que pas a tu abuela y te sal s r pido aqu te espero en el taxi
9259262 el lugar donde se suscit una ri a que termin en muertos y heridos
9259263 no te va a pasar nada nadie te va a comer
9259264 ta bien decile que ya salgo pero ya salite de aqu que te pueden llevar preso
9259265 and you know its great that its the u s open
9259266 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9259267 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9259268 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9259269 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9259270 and you know its great that its the u s open
9259271 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9259272 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9259273 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9259274 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9259275 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9259276 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9259277 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9259278 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9259279 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9259280 so something like what i am doing doesnt seem like wow to me
9259281 i dont think i would have done it if there wasnt something attached to it
9259282 without it many of these children would ultimately be left on the streets to die
9259283 it is perfect for their needs is safe and gives them room to grow
9259284 but the fellow at that place back up on the hill should have some ill go see
9259285 i wonder if that town we just passed has someplace to buy a battery
9259286 go back to the exit turn left then right to a four way stop left again through town across the railroad track and youll see an auto parts store on your left
9259287 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9259288 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9259289 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9259290 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9259291 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9259292 we emphasize technique and performance and being well rounded kids
9259293 we have more fun with this than the state fair
9259294 there are two i 435 and 152 interchanges one is on the east side near liberty and one on the west closer to platte city anyway as a northlander on the west side it would be nice if they differentiated the two
9259295 for example as in the case of the i 435 152 interchange confusion sometimes thats all the information that is given to us so until helicopter pilot and traffic reporter
9259296 another reason is that if there are several traffic problems to report we tend to run through them as quickly as possible to get everybody informed because if we miss one or two you can bet were going to hear about it
9259297 that leads to another reason if we have been reporting the problem for some time we tend to drop or forget to mention some of the extra details
9259298 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9259299 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9259300 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9259301 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9259302 i am someone who knows how to take complex issues on all sides and come up with a comprehensive approach
9259303 to me that is a good definition of a moderate
9259304 she doesnt have a thing in common with the people of this district
9259305 from the time they were married they were together 24 7
9259306 i brought 75 kids to stay at the funeral home
9259307 the boys slept in the large chapel the girls in the small chapel and the sponsors in the family room my mother had 150 for spaghetti dinner the marching band even came to this day at obu that story lives on
9259308 i cant imagine her keeping all the balls in the air like she did
9259309 if you die today do you know where you will go
9259310 i hope not the hinton funeral home because we are full
9259311 id visit her every monday and shed be sitting outside her room and shed always have someone talking with her
9259312 my parents were always more concerned about helping people than making money
9259313 my mother always put the needs of others over her own
9259314 unfortunately weather disruptions at an airlines hub impact flight operations across our entire network
9259315 this results in many operation decisions needing to be made including those that impacted your travel
9259316 but i taped the left one today because it was a little sore nick said let me tape the right one he taped it so hard and look at what happened
9259317 if i dont have that ankle taped i think i would have broken my ankle that tape just held me up how weird is that someone is looking out for me upstairs
9259318 im doing all of the precautions icing stretching with that i think ill be able to get by until the end of the season ill take the next step after that if i still have it
9259319 with ryan the fact that hes on the roster our lack of right handed power and the fact hes having a pretty good year in triple a i think it would be good for us to get a look at him
9259320 but it does affect the number of at bats available its tough to get them both up here at the same time were still working through all of that to see how we can possibly do it
9259321 but i taped the left one today because it was a little sore nick said let me tape the right one he taped it so hard and look at what happened
9259322 if i dont have that ankle taped i think i would have broken my ankle that tape just held me up how weird is that someone is looking out for me upstairs
9259323 im doing all of the precautions icing stretching with that i think ill be able to get by until the end of the season ill take the next step after that if i still have it
9259324 with ryan the fact that hes on the roster our lack of right handed power and the fact hes having a pretty good year in triple a i think it would be good for us to get a look at him
9259325 but it does affect the number of at bats available its tough to get them both up here at the same time were still working through all of that to see how we can possibly do it
9259326 that just shows you right there that we can do it if we work the count weve got the offensive power to do that we showed that tonight
9259327 it tells you where im at with my ability level so thats extremely frustrating
9259328 and they all scored but we were able to limit them to that thats the big thing especially with that team the power that they have if you can limit them to a one spot in an inning thats the biggest key
9259329 and thats what i was thinking dang do i ever get a hit against this guy
9259330 and i hit them i could have missed them thats baseball i just happened to be locked in
9259331 that just shows you right there that we can do it if we work the count weve got the offensive power to do that we showed that tonight
9259332 it tells you where im at with my ability level so thats extremely frustrating
9259333 and they all scored but we were able to limit them to that thats the big thing especially with that team the power that they have if you can limit them to a one spot in an inning thats the biggest key
9259334 and thats what i was thinking dang do i ever get a hit against this guy
9259335 and i hit them i could have missed them thats baseball i just happened to be locked in
9259336 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59 he said
9259337 im going to have to do a little better weir said
9259338 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible streelman said
9259339 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9259340 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9259341 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9259342 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf clark said
9259343 i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly felt i could hit a few good shots
9259344 but no 8 was always going to be tough he said and that proved to be true
9259345 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9259346 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9259347 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9259348 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9259349 there is an understandable concern about the high price of gas and food and many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy
9259350 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9259351 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9259352 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9259353 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9259354 our focus is really on this side of the river
9259355 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9259356 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9259357 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9259358 i do think i need to win but it is feasible and it would be a wonderful way to make the team
9259359 ollys the favorite but ill see if i can make him sweat a little
9259360 i think youve got plenty out of me this week thank you very much
9259361 put down the ax lulu bell just needs some water shell recover in a week and some days

9259371 there are terrorists around and we have to flush them out
9259372 there are terrorists around and we have to flush them out
9259373 that was my baby you know i had to go get my baby
9259374 the water was three inches from the top of the sign and im going oh my lord
9259375 as i recall the battery went dead about the time katrina must have hit or sometime in that time frame i dont know when but it had that same time and i was able to salvage it
9259376 i am concerned for her in that she never made it in her home and now were facing the same dilemma that we were facing three years ago when they became homeless because katrina washed out everything they owned
9259377 theyre concerned that gustav its on the path to hit new orleans they want to make sure they get out
9259378 just dispersing like op were gone well come back if its safe monday night
9259379 mom is water supposed to be shooting out from under the dishwasher
9259380 im going to take a shower now if you have a question an opinion a gripe a monologue a concern or a bottle that needs opening now is the time
9259381 nobody has anything to say im not kidding this is it
9259382 once i shut that bathroom door im dead to you do you understand
9259383 well technically hes already in here but his mom says its ok shes on the phone do you want to talk to her
9259384 never mind mom she says shes just going to come over she wants to talk to you about the dogs barking anyway i told her now was a good time
9259385 will i need to call an ambulance the insurance company or a neighbor to apologize will i see my house on the news tonight
9259386 will animal control need to be summoned to pull your brother out of the drain pipe again
9259387 i was just going to tell you the roofer was here to fix the leak above the bathroom skylight i told him to go on up
9259388 yeah but hes gone now he must have gotten it fixed because he looked really happy when he left and he said to tell you it was good to see you which is kind of dumb because you never even came to the door
9259389 but we showed a little bit of old school grit there from the chicago catholic league in the fourth quarter thats how they breed us over in this catholic league
9259390 we definitely thought we were going to score more points on them
9259391 we had a good game plan loyola just had a good defense we had a tough time running the ball we had a couple of drops and i missed a couple of reads theyre a good team
9259392 if we want to throw the ball we got to be able to catch it too
9259393 we didnt get to show as much passing as we like today
9259394 but we found something that was working so we stuck with it
9259395 put down the ax lulu bell just needs some water shell recover in a week and some days
9259396 aw i werent gonna kill it just hack off er forelock and replace it with a wheel
9259397 dad burn mule had to go lame right before the turns to fallow
9259398 well make our plowshares turn those furrows somehow maybe rent a tortoise for a week me n you still got blood harvest to pack and freeze
9259399 therell be enough for a bath later if you dont waste it washing your hands before go start dinner
9259400 come on give papa a sip before that crippled beast touches it
9259401 fever aint gonna go down saw it in her eyes saw it on her tongue saw it in her shit
9259402 while it is general knowledge that red amber stone repels the fae ghosts evil spirits goblins witchcraft and every other evil and malign influence alike however there is no rule without an exception or as franks say
9259403 hello red i believe you have my gnome head i want it
9259404 then ill fill your cranium with some enchanted hollow points take my gnome head carry you back to the town and let everyone see that their greatest fear their shining evil knight in red amber stone armor was not some demon spawn super powered invulnerable goblin but an old dwarf in some mechanical suit covered in shiny rock
9259405 tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
9259406 there is no fear in love for perfect love casts out fear
9259407 does not give us a spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind
9259408 let tyrants shake their iron rod and slavry clank her galling chains we fear them not we trust in god new englands god forever reigns
9259409 he has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat oh be swift my soul to answer him be jubilant my feet our god is marching on
9259410 if god be for us who can be against us
9259411 we can put up power numbers as good as anybody else weve just got to stay in the zone and work for good pitches
9259412 we said before the game we hoped these guys felt comfortable with it being kenny rogers and having had some success against him
9259413 we were talking in the dugout maybe we should save some of the runs
9259414 but well take em we finally got some clutch hits and put something together we looked up in the sixth inning and had zero guys left on base which is just kind of the polar opposite of what weve been doing
9259415 once they get something going especially with that team the power that they have the quality hitters that they have if you can just give up a one spot in an inning thats the biggest key
9259416 he did a real good job of damage control and not allowing it to carry over into big innings
9259417 nick taped my left one because it was sore and taped the right one too
9259418 i couldve broken that ankle somebody up there is looking out for me today
9259419 as a manager you accept that i thought he was fair in saying he would check they said foul ball and theres nothing i can do about it
9259420 if they were going to have it i was hoping to be on the field the first time theyve used it but it was pretty clearly foul
9259421 ankiel was diving and i saw it i just didnt do anything about it
9259422 i threw the next pitch away and he hit it out of the ballpark that was my fault entirely i saw him diving and i shouldve thrown a pitch inside there
9259423 you want more but i wouldve been happy with two
9259424 then all of a sudden here comes hunter were thinking just get a sac fly and he drives one out of the ballpark it took good swings to really lock in on st louis pitcher braden looper because hes been tough on us
9259425 i think everybodys mindset is lets just go up there and have some good at bats
9259426 i think it becomes contagious after about the fifth hitter id say the six hole hitter probably walks up there and goes man i dont want to make the first out it just continues to roll down the line
9259427 he has got some major hits for us big time hits for us
9259428 ive said since spring training that hes one of those guys that can hit the three run homer the two run homer and kind of break things open a little bit it seems like he always seems to do that
9259429 i guess the pitches ive been making all along today they were an inch off the plate
9259430 i wasnt able to make that adjustment early in the game and it cost me
9259431 you dont see that many opposite field homers anymore but when i made a mistake they really made me pay tonight it seemed like everything they were right on it and i wasnt getting away with anything
9259432 i think just getting comfortable sometimes that first inning for whatever reason can be just kind of finding your way around
9259433 i did that the first inning i was just trying to get into a groove there its so early in the game right there you cant let that get to you you just try to shut it down after that
9259434 i knew it short hopped me and i popped up like i caught it i knew it was a short hop i also knew it was a tough one it was up to the umpire and it was a tough call for him to make
9259435 tonight im sitting in my seat where i normally sit in the dugout and i saw it as a bounce
9259436 im an older guy and i saw that with my natural eye
9259437 thats a base hit and an rbi for a guy quintero whos out there scratching trying to do his thing it just makes no sense not to get help
9259438 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful each day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9259439 for everyone out there that thinks they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9259440 you need to be scared and you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9259441 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9259442 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9259443 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9259444 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9259445 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9259446 its not like all of a sudden we decided to score a bunch of runs tonight thats not how it works
9259447 it definitely plays big over there in left center but we swung the bats well tonight and if you square them up as much as we have lately you tend to get a few of those
9259448 it seems like we see him every time we play them
9259449 hes very very tough on us he keeps the score down and when cameron hit the three run homer i felt good because hes hard to score off of
9259450 hes changing speeds spotting his ball well on the attack
9259451 regardless of if you win or lose going out there and throwing some quality innings up there just to give the team a chance is being effective
9259452 anytime that youre part of something thats first is special
9259453 its an honor to have that title its nice to do something for the organization that brought you in
9259454 i felt like maybe three or four balls were hit hard
9259455 i was like can they please just hit one ball i dont care how hard they hit it just right at somebody that would be nice they were finding all the holes today then i had to bear down and try to keep them from scoring luckily enough i was able to do that
9259456 he did a tremendous job pitching and he stayed after it
9259457 he gave up 11 hits but he scattered his hits he didnt walk anybody i think that was a key too
9259458 he was struggling at the start of the season and at that time we had a couple weaknesses in our rotation
9259459 he went down to the minor leagues came back and hes definitely stabilized that hes pitched like everybody thought he could
9259460 if its just once or twice it happens throughout the year you can deal with it because its a part of the game but i think thats seven now where ive left the game with the lead
9259461 wash has given us a chance to win every time
9259462 i wasnt really sharp the first two innings thats for sure
9259463 i had a couple breaks but after that i settled in and hit my spots better
9259464 he just went lights out for about four to five innings there
9259465 anytime the ball goes over the fence it feels good no matter how old you are or how many times youve done it
9259466 but its always nice to get the first one out of the way
9259467 choo timed it and right there in that part of the ballpark it flies i knew as soon as it was elevated it was going out
9259468 nobodys eyes are working that quick to know unless its extremely obvious
9259469 beltre stopped put his hand up and intentionally hit the baseball
9259470 if thats the case its an automatic double play and thats what it should have been
9259471 thats one of the best seven innings weve had from our young guys this season if not the best
9259472 he gave us what we needed he certainly deserved the victory
9259473 i was feeling nervous in the first inning i relaxed after that i tried to mix up my fastballs and changeup both were working pretty good
9259474 im sure he was a little nervous he started to get a feel for his changeup he settled down after the first couple innings
9259475 im not saying it wasnt serious to begin with but its the difference between playing the game and not playing the game
9259476 i dont think were looking at him being active for us the rest of the season the doctors have to decide whats best for him
9259477 then well have a better idea where we are with him and how soon he joins us if he is going to join us
9259478 i think hes pitched better when hes completely when hes completely healthy
9259479 its one thing we dont want to try to overdo any of those guys because of our situation and thats the reason we did it for us its not a big deal its something that pitching coach don cooper and we talk and are thinking about and thats the reason we did it
9259480 during the long grind of the season any extra day you can get youll take it
9259481 i feel fine now but i can see where they are coming from
9259482 my ultimate goal was to get 200 innings or around there and im not there yet
9259483 i want the ball as much as they will give it to me they wanted to push me back a day and im totally fine with that
9259484 thats the way that i look at it a lot of players arent lucky enough to play this long
9259485 any kind of record of longevity is a good one
9259486 ive been doing all my things and my work and have been working out
9259487 im trying to throw as hard as i can and you see the gun 91 88 mph everybody goes through these and i just have to wait for my arm strength and my arm power to come back so i can do a good job for my team
9259488 i think this is the time when you have close to 180 innings you have to save your bullets you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9259489 i didnt throw side sessions friday or the day before i just played long catch and i think it worked for me
9259490 hes pitched a lot of innings in the last six seven years
9259491 you can compare him with a lot of people but i dont know anyone who has logged the pitches and innings that he has
9259492 hopefully its just something hes going through and he rebounds and it becomes a dead issue hes a big strong guy and he expects a lot out of himself and it all feeds into it
9259493 i dont feel any pain in my arm at all
9259494 if i felt pain id tell them i dont want to pitch through pain like i did in tampa bay on june 16 they knew it i knew it i said at that time i cant throw like this and i needed a little rest and everything worked better its just a dead arm now
9259495 i might even throw sean marshall in the rotation for a day so zambrano can get a little more rest
9259496 this happens to a lot of pitchers especially when youre a power pitcher
9259497 the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this this is a new experience for me two years in a row its happened to me next year if it happens i will try to pitch with it and make an adjustment and just get through
9259498 not for what the wealth would do for me i dont spend it we live very modestly in comparison to our wealth
9259499 but the fact that at one stage soon after listing this business was worth 1bn when i saw that i thought not many people have created a billion pound business in their life
9259500 ive always said that basically i havent really worked ive had a hobby for 25 years which ive enjoyed thoroughly the day i dont want to get in that car i wont
9259501 we have always been very very frugal in the way weve run this business weve never spent a penny when a hapenny would do
9259502 if some horrible big life company or bank or institution bought it we felt it would ruin it
9259503 weve also had the opportunity to work harder because more people have been prepared to entrust their money to us
9259504 we havent had a recession in this country for 15 years im a great believer in recessions i think a recession every five years is brilliant
9259505 it puts a hand of caution on governments which is the most important thing and it also puts a hand of caution on the citizens of that country it says now wait a minute dont buy a house on seven times your earnings because you might not have your job
9259506 but after 15 years of continued growth people believed there was no chance they would ever lose their job and thats why people borrowed and borrowed and borrowed
9259507 and the government was leading it the government was borrowing and spending so the general populace thought that was the right thing to do
9259508 we shouldnt have been aiming for 2pc inflation we should have been aiming for minus 2pc inflation
9259509 i would love to say that this is what you should do in stable times you can do that but i dont know whats going to happen to the pound and the state of the economy indicates the market could go lower
9259510 if at the end of day we can suddenly see light at end of tunnel we could see markets go up quite quickly so people who have lost money in this market would be ill advised to come out but possibly people who are not in this market already might show some caution about going in
9259511 according to the ketchikan daily news edition on august 8 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the primary election campaign
9259512 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9259513 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9259514 the worlds scary and complex and obama just isnt ready yet
9259515 is he attacking me or is he attacking his vp candidate
9259516 now i have to say madeleine that i find that argument completely beneath anyone
9259517 i just thought that ice cream should be made here in kansas city and i got tired of never having the flavors i wanted to have
9259518 this is our name so it matters to us that people like our product
9259519 it was the way it was done in the old days our dad wanted to make sure our ice cream tasted like it did back then
9259520 its not that different from the old time method of cooking a pot of chili
9259521 if you leave it in the fridge for a week and come back it just tastes better you just have to give the flavors a chance to mingle and with patience everything blossoms
9259522 dr racela since the beginning of the filipino association has been the leader and the force behind almost everything weve accomplished
9259523 i became involved with the filipino association when my children were growing up
9259524 my wife and i realized that we needed to preserve the best of philippine culture for them and for others i didnt want them to forget where we came from
9259525 were about to pay off our loan and its time to expand
9259526 we need more room for meetings and permanent cultural exhibit space
9259527 its been a wonderful experience for my wife and i and my family over the years
9259528 the selection of governor palin is great news for conservatives for the party and for the country i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9259529 following the democrats superb convention sen john mccain gave his candidacy a needed shot in the arm with his selection of alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate the conservative base is revitalized and the race is wide open
9259530 at least on the republican ticket the experienced one is the leader and the apprentice is in the correct position
9259531 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9259532 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9259533 ill never hear the end of this from pedroia or ortiz pedroia said its long overdue and ortiz said hes retiring
9259534 petey his hot this isnt something were going to do the rest of the year were a little bit sick and banged up so this looked like a pretty good lineup
9259535 people take him for granted hes cocky got toughness and got everything going for him
9259536 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9259537 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9259538 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9259539 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9259540 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9259541 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9259542 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9259543 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received
9259544 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9259545 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9259546 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9259547 hmm i shall wear my sandles while i jig around with this girl
9259548 hey guys before we go to the strip join let me put on my combat shorts
9259549 trying to watch all the political stuff i want to be prepared its a big responsibility representing nine counties ive been all over the district to meet people and theyre all so warm and friendly
9259550 im curious to see what its like to be on the floor and have a delegates seat
9259551 i hope to come back with a lot of enthusiasm and ideas on how to support mccains campaign here in illinois
9259552 he told me obviously you have to get your sleep at night and eat right
9259553 he also said you dont have to take batting practice every day youve got to make sure youre both mentally and physical ready he said what worked for him is not hitting every day you know how to hit if you dont hit every day youre not going to lose it
9259554 yeah im trying to figure it out and trying to do whats best to get through the day
9259555 physically i dont feel as bad as i thought mentally is the biggest part physically ive never been through this before so mentally im grinding through it
9259556 obviously weve fell off as far as our playing it doesnt look like were going to make the playoffs so ive just told myself to be ready every day and do the best you can
9259557 but thats when your mental toughness kicks in this will be good for him as he moves forward its a grind
9259558 somewhere along the lines though i have to find a way to get him a couple of days off
9259559 id be lying if i said it wasnt hard to be accommodating all the time
9259560 ive done less stuff since the all star game as far as the media sometime i forget myself im playing more games than ive ever had people forget that fans players whatever
9259561 obviously i want to finish strong its important to finish strong
9259562 its easy to start off good it would be good for my confidence to finish strong
9259563 it would mean a lot but if it doesnt happen then it doesnt happen
9259564 this is just my second year hopefully ill have a lot more chances no matter what happens at the end of the year obviously ill feel like i had a good season
9259565 we still have 36 hours to get something done in that time frame
9259566 i have to look out for the interests of the club were not going to do anything that will jeopardize our future
9259567 were going to make the best decisions for the club that we have on the field right now its a good club im content to go to war with these guys
9259568 we have a pool of guys were looking at that will be narrowed in the next 48 hours
9259569 it is going to be the best fit as far as what we need there are certainly needs we have and certainly some experience to be gained in going through the playoffs down in triple a so it is going to be the best fit for all of us
9259570 are we ready to elect the most inexperienced candidate of our times
9259571 usually we do not keep so much stock of gold jewellery in the shop but as the festive season is we got new stock
9259572 we have started investigating the case it is possible that someone know to the jewellers may be involved
9259573 if a guy is close to getting to baseball activities then its a no brainer
9259574 you want to take him on the road with you and monitor that if a guy is far enough away and depending on the needs of what our training staff can provide it could be better to get more concentrated work back here
9259575 it is going to take a little time and you dont have a crystal ball to see how it progresses we know howie is going to take a little more time than erick there are a lot of things to determine whether were going to take him on the road or not
9259576 hopefully it is some time in september but we really dont know
9259577 there are certainly some hurdles you have to clear before youre out there ready to play in a major league baseball game well just have to gauge and see where he is but there is no magic formula
9259578 i wouldnt count on it im not saying it wont happen but i wont count on it
9259579 if i reinjure this its going to be worse and ill end up being out the whole season
9259580 im close to coming back its just that were playing well anyway right now so theres no need for me to rush back
9259581 and he doesnt have a dead arm he might have a little bit of a tired arm
9259582 hes pitched a lot of innings over the past six or seven years
9259583 you can compare him with a lot of people i dont know anyone whos logged the innings and pitches that he has
9259584 its not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher
9259585 the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this
9259586 ive been doing all my things and my work and have been working out
9259587 im trying to throw as hard as i can and you see the radar gun 91 88 mph everybody goes through these and i just have to wait for my arm strength and my arm power to come back
9259588 hopefully its just something hes going through and hell rebound and then it will become a dead issue
9259589 you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9259590 i didnt do a side session friday or the day before i just played long catch and i think it will work for me
9259591 i dont feel any pain in my arm it feels good
9259592 a lot of it has to do with giving back to the community
9259593 you have to give back what you were rewarded for
9259594 ive had a lot of fun its been a great career ive always had the opportunity to meet lots of people and ive acquired great friends over the years
9259595 we at allen brothers are extremely proud of his many accomplishments on behalf of allen brothers and the culinary community
9259596 viewers want to see firsthand what there is to do in the region they are about to visit these videos give them a personal tour of attractions accommodations shopping venues dining options and more
9259597 the videos are light and fun but also extremely educational and interesting
9259598 video video video was the overwhelming subject of the conference and it being the leader of the new social networking onslaught
9259599 i wanted our bureau to stay ahead of the curve so we are moving forward by adding these videos to our already award winning web site
9259600 we dont know how the case is under investigation at this point
9259601 i was pretty shaken up when i saw the handcuffs i didnt know if he had a gun or if he was going to strangle me with his cuffs
9259602 he jumped into a black lincoln navigator i got the license plate number and called the vernon hills police
9259603 it was 138 and he paid me 150 cash i wasnt going to take a check
9259604 we know who he is and we will catch him
9259605 i have a printer the size of a queen sized bed
9259606 this is the only show i do i like this show its local for me
9259607 it has become the premier teaching event in the kingdom
9259608 its a romantic bunch of people having fun with recreating a different time
9259609 i enjoy the costumes and the skills needed to create these
9259610 i cant tell you how many officers but the officers have been paying closer attention to the area
9259611 compared to when we first moved here things are much better
9259612 what tends to happen is that theres a lot of interest in these types of incidents when they happen but when nothing is happening in the neighborhood its very hard to mobilize people
9259613 we didnt have color photos in those days and i was surprised at his eastern accent
9259614 and isnt this a wonderful exhibit this town has tremendous respect for its history
9259615 marion moon was in the class and so was beth cigrand
9259616 moon became the mother of astronaut edwin aldrin who landed on the moon
9259617 for many people it brings back their childhood for young people this is where they can see a lot of batavias history
9259618 we have been set back a little by weather the last couple of weeks
9259619 we didnt really talk much about the wooden spoon you come off earning the respect of your team mate
9259620 it wasnt about us getting off the bottom tonight it was about having the respect for each other
9259621 we felt the forwards we put out tonight were as good a pack the club has got
9259622 we expected a dominant performance like that and the forwards were outstanding
9259623 i thought luke odonnell on the edge was very dominant with some big hits and that was pretty much across the board so that was very pleasing
9259624 it gives us a little bit of confidence and something to look forward to next year but we want to focus on hopefully getting a win at shark park
9259625 we turned over too much possession and i have to put my hand up there too
9259626 we have a bit of a longer turnaround and we are still in an exciting position
9259627 weve seen it over a long period of time some of them with happy endings and some of them with not so happy endings and theyll be trying to do it one way
9259628 well give those blokes the absolute respect but four points are up for grabs
9259629 we are really keen to make sure that we finish the season off in the right manner and obviously winning the last two allows us to get three in a row
9259630 i think he really needed to get that goal just to get the monkey off his back and as soon as he got his goal his confidence really lifted didnt it
9259631 im really pleased he probably could have got himself a hat trick at the end
9259632 i was a little bit surprised wellington didnt come out firing after last weeks result 4 2 loss to melbourne
9259633 but regardless of that i thought whoever the opposition is out there youve got to play to what resistance you get and we certainly started off the game extremely well and finished it off very well
9259634 weve worked very hard to put ourselves in a position where we are playing better football and were not going to flirt with that
9259635 we showed the valencia of last year that finished 10th in the league is a thing of the past
9259636 the club wanted to keep me and i feel comfortable here so it is all fine it is just nice to get back to scoring goals
9259637 the team did well and we won so i am happy although we suffered far too much in the final few minutes
9259638 i made the decision hes under pressure from his entourage and not fit to play
9259639 all my life and career ive always avoided drugs my thing was boxing you can ask anybody who knows me and they can tell you
9259640 a forward is always going to be frustrated when theyve got two or three guys on him i think he just responded really well like he did last week
9259641 the opposition is going to be throwing themselves on the ground and jumping around and carrying on every time he gets near the ball
9259642 theres a little bit of play acting i think going on from opposition teams which is a bit disappointing but thats what hally has to put up with at the moment
9259643 so i think we got everything we possibly could out of the game which was terrific
9259644 its great to be able to play up here it gives the guys a lot of confidence
9259645 theres not much positives to take out of round 22
9259646 im very happy i knew it was a tough match
9259647 i will just focus on my next match because every match is difficult hes playing very well i will have to play very well if i want to advance
9259648 i felt like i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9259649 she is very consistent it always helps when i dont make a lot of errors
9259650 i had a good passing shot on a break point that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9259651 i won the first set that was cool after the first set i was pretty pumped up
9259652 were trying to add a little more time to the event so itll hopefully give more people time to come
9259653 they are all seniors this year that would have graduated with tyler as well
9259654 this group of kids most of them have been around forever theyve known each other forever so they all would have graduated with tyler too
9259655 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9259656 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9259657 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9259658 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9259659 one of the great cities of the world cahokia was larger than london in a d 1250
9259660 man i feel about as good as i did when i was 19
9259661 im nothing but a stranger in this world i got a home on high
9259662 oh no john marks on another nostalgia trip its such a shame he used to be well he didnt used to be like this
9259663 oh oh oh oh oh sweet thing and i will raise my hand up into the night time skyyyyy and ill be satisfied not to read in between the lines and i will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain and i will never ever ever ever grow so old again oh sweet thing sweet thing
9259664 i wanted someone not too traditional someone with ideas who was open to experiencing life
9259665 i was relieved when he finally wrote me a letter
9259666 in our culture you have to go to the parents
9259667 dr racela since the beginning of the filipino association has been the leader and the force behind almost everything weve accomplished
9259668 i became involved with the filipino association when my children were growing up
9259669 my wife and i realized that we needed to preserve the best of philippine culture for them and for others i didnt want them to forget where we came from
9259670 were about to pay off our loan and its time to expand
9259671 we need more room for meetings and permanent cultural exhibit space
9259672 its been a wonderful experience for my wife and i and my family over the years
9259673 we caught them wading and drifting with plastics and topwaters
9259674 conditions have been calm and flat and our boats have caught over 20 tarpon up to 160 pounds this week lots of jack crevalle and sharks are being taken under the tarpon
9259675 the rains last week displaced a lot of birds but since we have dried up they came back it should be easy limits for whitewings around san antonio
9259676 everyone who comes in the store says they are seeing lots of teal
9259677 a lot of it has to do with giving back to the community
9259678 you have to give back what you were rewarded for
9259679 ive had a lot of fun its been a great career ive always had the opportunity to meet lots of people and ive acquired great friends over the years
9259680 we at allen brothers are extremely proud of his many accomplishments on behalf of allen brothers and the culinary community
9259681 the bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism but theres nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent americans
9259682 the intelligence court should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear
9259683 reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9259684 academy awards this year biden and obama are making stops in ohio today
9259685 i dont care if other states banned smoking or not its killing a lot of businesses
9259686 the state should have given neighborhood taverns the option to go smoking or nonsmoking we have several nonsmoking customers who had no problems coming here
9259687 my place was a working mans bar where people want to sit down chat with friends and have a cigarette
9259688 now people are thinking should i go in and spend 3 for a bottle of beer or spend 16 for a 30 pack and smoke at home
9259689 the second we closed we lost everything that was grandfathered in and they just want too much done with the electricity plumbing and getting the bathrooms up to code for handicapped accessible use
9259690 we tried to get enough money to pay off all of our bills and walk off into the sunset by selling the place but it didnt happen
9259691 i have a printer the size of a queen sized bed
9259692 this is the only show i do i like this show its local for me
9259693 everybody was friendly and left happy even if their attempt didnt turn out the way they had hoped
9259694 both groups are not for profit organizations who rely heavily on volunteers who appreciate and are interested in horses
9259695 its such a great program that has brought strength balance and fun into my life
9259696 our riders enjoy volunteering because it gives them the best seats in the house
9259697 they get to be up close and personal at the events and gain insight into the previous lives of our program horses
9259698 its unusual to see horses jumping over logs and water
9259699 this is a very unique and great opportunity to pivot around and move forward to have a real strong 2010 here in illinois
9259700 there is no question the republican organization got comfortable and there is no question that due to failures in leadership people got turned off to the party
9259701 in 2010 i think it can be a lot better for us
9259702 we are playing defense right now that is the bottom line
9259703 i think he is a good example of the contrast with our own past
9259704 i know a lot of parties and social events are planned for minnesota which is fine
9259705 but i am hoping we also will be taking time and spending resources on working to win elections
9259706 i cant share 23 years with you in five minutes
9259707 even at age five or six he still wanted to fight he still wanted to make a difference
9259708 when i think of tony i hear the kid with the speech impediment who couldnt say grilled cheese
9259709 every time he got hurt his guys were there for him
9259710 i can truly understand why hed never want to leave them behind
9259711 tonys view of his mission was simple it was to stop people from killing americans
9259712 were going to miss tony more than we can say
9259713 with this collar he will speak without moving his mouth
9259714 i never have to pay for a meal because i cant reach for my wallet
9259715 i was pretty speechless when i got the call and i didnt know what to say
9259716 i am the fifth or sixth member of that particular team to be inducted
9259717 i credit bobby kilpatrick if not for his ability to teach us we wouldnt have reached that level
9259718 we averaged 9 3 runs a game that year and we didnt beat people with pitching but we were a danger whenever we came up to the plate i just tried to hit the ball in hard places all the time
9259719 it is a great honor and i am just thankful the university gave me an opportunity
9259720 beyond that it is hard to explain how i feel
9259721 jeff was a good ball player for us he proved that if you give 110 percent on the field good things can happen
9259722 there was just something about him that made other players just play harder and i dont know if it was just that thing of being from texas or what
9259723 i had a good fall with blinn in 1975 and the chicago cubs drafted me in the third round but i tore a hamstring in the spring and didnt play much after that when the cubs drafted me my family and i decided if it was available then it would be available later the cubs never contacted me and i never contacted them
9259724 back in those days we didnt lift weights and there was no select ball so it took a bit of adjustment when we got into the season
9259725 but kilpatrick elevated me from an average ball player to a good player i really do think that this is not about me but my teammates and coach
9259726 we have great teachers who are committed to student success
9259727 he has a great deal of experience with small learning communities and working campuses through issues
9259728 one thing thats very important is parents have to communicate with their teachers
9259729 this way parents can work with the school and with the teacher to help kids do well
9259730 our attendance is still in the high 90s which is good but we had a 1 percent drop last year
9259731 when you have 13 000 students that is pretty significant a child cant get a quality education without being in the classroom
9259732 we need to make sure we are all on the same page and make sure parents are contacted every time there is an issue
9259733 the reality is were low in certain areas but were not far from getting back to where we need to be
9259734 its something my grandchildren and other young people can see and realize the american dream is alive you just have to reach for it
9259735 hes someone who came from meager circumstances and accomplished a lot hes come a long way with gods help
9259736 its just a way of showing people who fly their flags that we support them
9259737 if you fly a flag well clean it for free
9259738 but dry cleaning definitely will extend the longevity of it
9259739 sometimes we do them behind the post just ourselves sometimes we get scout groups that want us to show them how we do it
9259740 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9259741 and it is warm not something im really used to
9259742 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9259743 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9259744 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9259745 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9259746 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9259747 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9259748 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9259749 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9259750 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9259751 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9259752 that was one thing that attracted a lot of people a lot of the adults that were buying the homes had small children so it was a good place to have the kids be able to play
9259753 the screen door blew off every time we put it on
9259754 i didnt like being locked up in a box in a house where you cant get outside this was perfect
9259755 buffalo grove has just about everything to offer now where when i was a child growing up i had to go elsewhere
9259756 i think it was a pretty quiet friendly town and it still is
9259757 its just a way of showing people who fly their flags that we support them
9259758 if you fly a flag well clean it for free
9259759 but dry cleaning definitely will extend the longevity of it
9259760 sometimes we do them behind the post just ourselves sometimes we get scout groups that want us to show them how we do it
9259761 people look at our situation and we still have 27 games to play here 26 after saturday its not like we have seven or eight
9259762 all weve done to date is gotten ourselves in position to go to the playoffs nothing more nothing less
9259763 we just squandered too many opportunities left too many men on base
9259764 ted gave us a chance to win but we couldnt get any runs for him
9259765 victorino i thought leaned out over the plate on a ball that might have been over the plate
9259766 but thats kind of his game hes a rally starter and unfortunately that works sometimes
9259767 trying to put myself in the umpires shoes for a second thats kind of the last thing you expect is a guy to lean out over the plate and get hit by a pitch
9259768 he didnt see it that way but i had a different angle the opposite angle he had
9259769 i did not feel a tag and i looked at the tape and didnt see it either
9259770 its very positive reflection on the community and shows the city of angleton and the council are working to maintain a high level of service and quality of life while trying to keep the tax rate the same
9259771 as much as we dont like being two to three times over budget we really dont have any choice
9259772 award contracts in 30 to 60 days not 24 months
9259773 im real close to the colorado river my land has a lot of sand in it from the millions of years that the colorado has been moving around in that area
9259774 in the hill country its pretty much the same thing the weather is a lot like it is in the south of france and the mediterranean area its a little more humid than it is there
9259775 its nice that there are more and more farms coming on line because when you get more more people come here for tourist reasons
9259776 you like to be the only game in town but sometimes its better if there are more so it gets in peoples heads to come here for lavender like they do for peaches or the wine
9259777 its nice because people are moving from one place to the next and were all in about a 10 mile radius
9259778 each place has different things going on its not all lavender
9259779 i lost a lot of plants this year and im doing some replanting
9259780 some of it will be blooming within the next couple of weeks our blooming season is a little later than in the hill country i dont know if its because of our elevation they tend to bloom a month or so earlier than we do this year were way off schedule
9259781 when these bloom theyll bloom for maybe six or eight weeks
9259782 were really trying to focus in on the best bloomers for the spring and fall so that we have something going on for the biggest part of the summer
9259783 you dont get that showy dark purple that you get in france or other places just because there are only certain varieties we have in texas
9259784 we make a lot of the products and the stuff we dont make local people make for us
9259785 its kind of a group effort from local artists soapmakers and things like that
9259786 i want it to be a nice place where people can come and hang out
9259787 i dont charge people to come out to the farm
9259788 have a picnic and look at the view and maybe buy some lavender products
9259789 its a good way for people to get out and enjoy the outdoors and its really beautiful up here and real peaceful
9259790 i never imagined she wouldnt be home now to be able to hold her whenever we can when we want to
9259791 the first night she was home we didnt sleep at all
9259792 we just wanted to take the time to love on her
9259793 we wanted the chance to lay her in her crib and pray over her its still hard for me to take my eyes off her
9259794 she always seems to know when its my turn to change her diaper
9259795 shes come so far and i want her all the way back
9259796 god has done so much for us we have so much to be thankful for
9259797 over the top ah moment that made this card perfect for my special sister diane i hope your day has been a wonderful one
9259798 any proper question relating to any matter in issue in the action
9259799 its something my grandchildren and other young people can see and realize the american dream is alive you just have to reach for it
9259800 hes someone who came from meager circumstances and accomplished a lot hes come a long way with gods help
9259801 she was using her brothers big wheel she couldnt quite reach the pedals she was at a disadvantage we need to buy her a girls big wheel
9259802 when youre little you want to get that big spin at the end
9259803 the big wheels are low to the bottom so youre not going to flip over
9259804 he rides it to school and all around the block
9259805 here its away from the crowd i think were going to start doing it here
9259806 it also gave us an opportunity to promote recreation programs as a whole as opposed to just aquatics
9259807 they came up and threw it in my face it was like they were mad at me
9259808 i cant tell you how many officers but the officers have been paying closer attention to the area
9259809 compared to when we first moved here things are much better
9259810 what tends to happen is that theres a lot of interest in these types of incidents when they happen but when nothing is happening in the neighborhood its very hard to mobilize people
9259811 i would probably pull for the cardinals but i also liked the white sox because of carlton fisk
9259812 he hit the ball real good today and hes been getting better thats exactly what we need jaysons got all the talent in the world the more he plays the better hell get
9259813 its a situation where the game is tied and its 2 0 with the bases loaded
9259814 he threw a strike and then i got a fastball i put a pretty good swing on it and went to right field with the pitch howie did a great job sliding around the tag his top speed is nice
9259815 he got a little charged up but at the same time he did a good job
9259816 today was a must for us this late in the season we cant afford to be losing three and four games in a row we are going to lose some but we have to hold it to a minimum
9259817 the guy that keeps his cool is usually the guy who comes through in big situations if theres a negative thought more than likely youre going to fail they say baseball builds character i dont know if it builds it but your character definitely comes out
9259818 we have to be more determined than ever and we can do it
9259819 the detectives said that it was a big deal because the people in the bartlett city hall saw it on tv and got really upset
9259820 they basically told me it was their decision whether i go to jail or not and they told me that if i promised not to shoot any more stuff in bartlett then they wont take me in
9259821 i think its disgusting i think im not letting my kids go down that slide anymore
9259822 my fans and my members email me what they would like to see and they like public places
9259823 i try to accommodate my members and my fans so i decided to go ahead and do a park scene
9259824 there was nobody there or i wouldnt have done it
9259825 well i think you made am impression about sugar intake
9259826 oh how happy she must have been to know i like brownies
9259827 if you treat an individual as if he were what he ought to be and could be he will become what he ought to be and could be
9259828 we thought doing something really special for our employees away from the workplace was the best way we could say thank you to them for their hard work and dedication that they demonstrate at basf every day
9259829 we received nothing but positive comments even those who had never heard of b j thomas said they were blown away by his performance
9259830 and thats what we were aiming for for our employees to have a truly special evening in honor of our 50th and in honor of their commitment
9259831 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
9259832 i thought that was pretty amazing why does that happen and how does it point people to jesus good question im glad you asked several months back i did a post titled back from sex in gatlinburg
9259833 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9259834 and it is warm not something im really used to
9259835 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9259836 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9259837 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9259838 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9259839 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9259840 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9259841 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9259842 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9259843 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9259844 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9259845 i cant even think of a title for this sick crap
9259846 i think you can be an honest person and lie about any number of things

9259864 myanmars junta arrested 48 activists yesterday for a protest march marking 20 years since the army crushed an
9259865 they were all picked up and are being questioned at the moment
9259866 in bangkok and manila dozens of protesters chanted anti junta slogans burnt myanmar flags and waved placards calling for the release of democracy icon and nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi
9259867 the united states is steadfast in its call for burmas leaders to immediately release these and all other political prisoners the regime also must begin a genuine dialogue with the democracy movements leaders and ethnic minority leaders on a true transition to democratic government improved relations between the two countries depend on the burmese regime taking credible steps in this direction
9259868 why bother with no real resolve at the u n or the association of southeast asian nations to bring about political change in burma mr gambaris visits are meaningless the generals recognize that its time the u n did too
9259869 der un sonderbeauftragte ibrahim gambari will sich der kommenden woche in birma erneut um eine schrittweise demokratisierung des landes bem hen der spitzendiplomat soll am montag der 18 08 anmerkung des verfassers in rangun eintreffen es ist gambaris vierter besuch seit der blutigen niederschlagung friedlicher proteste durch das milit rregime im vergangenen september die vereinten nationen fordern demokratische reformen und die freilassung aller politischen gefangenen einschlie lich oppositionsf hrerin aung san suu kyi
9259870 the international community hoped that he would succeed in persuading the military to open a genuine political dialogue with aung san suu kyi and ethnic groups to create a national reconciliation process that could lead to a genuine democracy
9259871 mr gambari who aims to promote democratic reform in burma is likely to be hoping for a more successful visit than his last one in march which he described as disappointing
9259872 roadmap 2010 und die m glichkeiten von neuwahlen in zwei jahren burma berichterstattung frei und gerecht sollen sie werden versprach er mitgliedern der nld
9259873 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognise the military backed constitution the un envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
9259874 instead gambari met with the leaders of the ruling junta which has identifies itself as the union solidarity and development association usda it is a gang similar to hitlers brown shirts which carried out an assassination attempt on nobel laureate suu kyi on may 30 2003 scores of her supporters were slaughtered during that pre meditated attack
9259875 it is very clear aung san suu kyi has made it incredibly clear by refusing to meet with mr gambari that she has lost confidence in this process and she refuses to engage in this process
9259876 it is our job and a continuing challenge at the un to make the impossible possible and will continue my efforts at mediation regardless
9259877 is it too much for the democratic forces in burma to expect that the united nations will quickly come to grips with the yangon crisis in a more direct manner

9259925 i am very excited that senator mccain chose sarah palin as his running mate she is a social conservative pro life and stands for many of the same issues i believe in i was supporting senator mccain before but now i am thrilled with the addition of gov palin i believe we will finally have a strong voice for pro life in the white house
9259926 gov palin is a very good candidate she is pro life and a woman and i believe she will help bring the evangelical vote to the republican campaign i will definitely vote for senator mccain over obama because he is more pro life than obama and he understands the issues facing us
9259927 it was an excellent choice to pick sarah palin it was a smart pick and john mccain found a way to engage the base of support that he needs in this campaign palin is very pro life and i think she will unite the pro life support for mccain
9259928 i dont know a lot about her views on all the issues but i can appreciate her pro life position i would tend to favor someone who is definitely pro life in this election
9259929 a woman is running on one ticket and an african american is on the other ticket
9259930 they both display what the united states of america is supposed to be about and the freedom and equality this country stands for
9259931 i am a second generation american from european descent my father never graduated from high school and spent time in the civilian conservation corps with men of all colors when he first moved into the pleasant heights neighborhood years ago he was looked down upon and told to go back downtown where he belonged but he worked hard and made a successful business and now we are seeing two americans make history in this political campaign
9259932 i think sarah palin will bring stability to the republican ticket along with fresh eyes
9259933 the fact that sarah palin is on the republican ticket and barack obama is leading the democratic ticket says so much about our country
9259934 may be an attempt to just get the women vote
9259935 i really dont know if palin will help or hurt the republican ticket but i am voting for obama because we need a change in this country he seems like hes for the working men and women
9259936 i think it is funny that mccain kept pushing obamas lack of experience and now he has chosen a woman who has been governor of alaska for just two years i am not against palin but she doesnt have that much experience
9259937 the city wasnt going to have a festival this year
9259938 the group was divided on whether to do this or not
9259939 we were a little concerned because people thought the festival had been canceled but there was a crowd even before the event opened
9259940 its important to be together and united during these times because of the condition this country is in your family is the only ones you can really depend upon
9259941 the sun always shines on the festival of the arts
9259942 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington d c
9259943 she displays grit and good sense and is devoted to the common good
9259944 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
9259945 spent weeks looking for a running mate to shape up washington
9259946 this is a moment when principles and political independence matter a lot more than party lines
9259947 this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome
9259948 to serve alongside such a man as vice president would be the privilege of a lifetime
9259949 i really like what john mccain stands for especially on the issue of pro life and i think sarah palin is an excellent choice to join him on the republican ticket
9259950 she is pro life and she is a woman which i really like
9259951 really excited because now we have a real pro life candidate i think senator mccain will bring his experience and she will learn from him and add strength to the ticket
9259952 i am very impressed by senator mccains choice he made a good choice and i am very happy that she is a social conservative i like her position on the social issues and i think she will add strength to the mccain ticket because he has already taken a strong position on the same social issues
9259953 i think she is so very american from everything she believes in and everything she has done he could not have made a better choice she may not have a lot of national experience but that shouldnt affect voting for mccain and palin she has about the same governmental administrative experience as obama has
9259954 because i havent made my mind up yet i am a democrat but i am excited about palin she has been running the state of alaska and apparently doing a good job i like what i have heard so far
9259955 i think gov palin will bring new and fresh ideas to the campaign plus she is a woman and that is good news i believe she may draw some of the hillary clinton supporters to john mccains campaign and i like the fact she is pro life
9259956 she chose to have her baby after she found out it would likely be a down syndrome baby that tells me a lot about her as a woman and a person she is a strong woman who understands what the average american is going through these days and i believe she will bring a lot to the national political scene now and in the future
9259957 because she stands for a lot of solid beliefs such as family values and moral issues i also like the fact she favors drilling for oil
9259958 i think a lot of women who supported hillary clinton will now consider voting for the mccain palin ticket and that will help us win in november
9259959 i dont care that we have sat in the sun for several hours today
9259960 we are absolutely thrilled by senator mccains choice of sarah palin she fills a lot of squares for the republicans she will be an asset for the ticket
9259961 the sun doesnt matter today because it is just good to be here today to see this historic campaign ticket i am excited and very happy with the addition of sarah palin to the campaign
9259962 i think the issues that needed to be addressed have been in this proposed contract
9259963 i will be working to make copies of our documents to discuss the agreement with the stewards and then those representatives and myself will be in the mill later today and in the coming days to explain the agreement to our membership
9259964 in addition to the main table contract issues we also had several local issues that we addressed as well
9259965 there was a real sense of solidarity and unity on the issues as we continued negotiations we took a strike authorization vote at weirton last week that gave overwhelming support to our negotiating team in pittsburgh we never stopped negotiating and we reached a conclusion saturday afternoon
9259966 these were very complicated negotiations that included specific issues for each plant but in the end we succeeded
