5100043 after the construction of the road the number of trekkers will be reduced we have a trade off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment we need to create alternative attractions to just trekking
5100044 we are trying to create man made tourism attractions like theme parks adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting
5100045 will mainly go to a few specialised tour operators and some more expensive hotels
5100046 although there will be some trickle down of profits for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty
5100047 there will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night is this the way we want to treat our planet
5100048 the bigger the danger that the situation will deteriorate and the policy choices will become more difficult and unpleasant

5100055 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport two days ago reports said we had destroyed the airport
5100056 this is not true we have not been engaged in any military action for two days only conducting reconnaissance

5100059 there were kids running around and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film and were completely transfixed
5100060 i remember thinking where else are they going to see that not on tv and i thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into childrens lives
5100061 a week later i got a prize and a bonus from a film studio that exactly covered it
5100062 and attention to the project itself people are taking it seriously
5100063 you can see films like this in paris and now you can see them in nairn
5100064 if you come in a kilt for powell and pressburgers i know where im going you can come in free

5100068 going to a restaurant that you trust and saying feed me people are coming not because they know all the films we are showing but out of trust people have said its like going to the pictures as a child being taken and told you are going to love this and you know anyone can do this all you need is some dvds and a space
5100069 for once you can happily look around and actually make eye contact with people its the shared enthusiasm thats so compelling

5100087 theres no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but there s a philosophical reason why design doesn t want to do it you
5100088 if he adds a little composure to his game hell do really well for us
5100089 the kid has everything you want in a footballer and if he keeps playing like this hell be a fantastic one
5100090 i thought we were very good in the first half but their midfield overran us in the second
5100091 im still a tottenham player but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5100092 however im now with the national team so i just want to think about the national team
5100093 i still have a lot of friends at tottenham and im not angry about ramos naming me as a substitute people say i looked unhappy but if i was laughing when i was on the bench they would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5100094 i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker can be dimitar berbatov
5100095 there are still two weeks of the transfer window to go but this is the most important week yet
5100096 we went with giovani dos santos instead because we thought his speed would worry middlesbrough
5100097 but as middlesbrough tired we thought it would be the right moment to substitute him and bring on berbatov
5100098 were thinking long term and the aim is to take this club into the champions league
5100099 that is the vision and because we cannot compete financially for the top players the only way we will do that is by giving youngsters an opportunity
5100100 there probably are people out there who want to see me fail but thats football thats life and it makes me more determined to make sure we do well at blackburn rovers its not just me there are other people that happens to as well its just a case of getting used to it its my first game as a premier league manager we got three points and i just want to enjoy it
5100101 i dont really get any personal pleasures out of anything because i know football can change from one week to the next
5100102 but i just think over the last few weeks people have been trying to unsettle the whole club but all that crap weve had to suffer weve dispelled in 90 minutes of football at goodison park that makes it sweeter for me we could not have won here as we did without a team that is pulling in the same direction
5100103 we knew what the situation would be in may signing players was a priority at the end of last season and that hasnt changed
5100104 i said in the summer that i needed to get five players that could now be six or seven but im not changing im only going to bring quality in
5100105 michael carrick hurt an ankle which has swollen up badly
5100106 im happy for crouch because now he can play more games if a player plays only one game a month its not enough
5100107 thats how this division is and we have to learn from it
5100108 the first goal was a fluke but the other two were very sloppy and you cant afford to do that when you are playing against these sort of sides
5100109 we have a lot of young players here and today was a learning curve for them
5100110 but they are all very good players and i believe they have what it takes to make it in this division
5100111 times pressing and we may have to go with what weve got
5100112 it was a great start for him i was a bit surprised that ashley young was not in the england squad hes been absolutely class for us but his time will come as well
5100113 after his first goal the confidence came flooding through him and he took the other two goals magnificently
5100114 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5100115 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5100116 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5100117 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5100118 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5100119 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5100120 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5100121 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5100122 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5100123 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5100124 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5100125 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5100126 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5100127 people try to put us down just because we get around
5100128 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5100129 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5100130 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5100131 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5100132 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5100133 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5100134 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5100135 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5100136 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5100137 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5100138 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5100139 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5100140 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5100141 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5100142 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5100143 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5100144 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5100145 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5100146 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5100147 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5100148 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5100149 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5100150 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5100151 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5100152 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5100153 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5100154 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5100155 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5100156 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
5100157 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
5100158 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
5100159 the partners at johnnys acknowledged from the beginning they wanted to tie up the space if it was to be vacated to ensure another burger hot dog place didnt move in next door
5100160 i dont want another store restaurant selling something similar setting up shop next door and take those evil street venders and confine them in some woebegotten corner of downtown where they cant interfere with my business
5100161 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5100162 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5100163 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5100164 the ecocert label is a mark that represents superior quality of product
5100165 cosmetic and personal care companies who are seeking ecocert certification for their products now have an ecocert approved glycol to use in their formulations they can be confident that zemea will add to their natural content requirement for ecocert certification
5100166 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem and perhaps that is where policymakers attention should be focused as the banks cant or wont sort out the mess they were instrumental in creating
5100167 londons asking prices have finally begun to come in line with the rest of the country
5100168 sellers have recognised the need to price aggressively in the capital
5100169 areas with olympic linked pending transport links are forecast to be the best hedge against price falls
5100170 the number of transactions this year is in danger of being the lowest since 1959
5100171 people are mystified it makes it very much easier for selective schools which dont face the problems those in the national challenge face to get specialist status and extra funding
5100172 it is a new unfairness added to the wider unfairness of the 30 floor target in the national challenge
5100173 its undoubted that being in the national challenge will have damaged schools despite the best intentions the effect of being threatened with closure will impact on these schools for years to come
5100174 we recognise the concern the dcsfs decision will cause some schools but we are confident many of them will meet the floor target consideration will also be given to those that demonstrate good progress towards the target
5100175 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme weve never called these schools failing many are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5100176 not in response and had nothing to do with mr camerons visit
5100177 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
5100178 remarkable degree of mutual trust and expectation that characterises scandinavian social relations
5100179 barcelona is the leading example of a city that has got its leaders together and focused on what it wants to be known for
5100180 to a lesser extent liverpool is doing this its decided it wants to be a hip city and it has a plan to achieve it on the other hand leeds and sheffield have similar brand potential but its yet to be developed in a coordinated way
5100181 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5100182 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5100183 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5100184 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get promises made to different audiences dont stack up he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in the london mayoral election whilst promising the city to do more on infrastructure
5100185 cameron is promising lower taxes more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time
5100186 he pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage inheritance tax and stamp duty savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5100187 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy
5100188 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5100189 the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan
5100190 i am going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what the country needs now just as margaret thatcher mended the broken economy in the 1980s so we want to mend britains broken society in the early decades of the 21st century its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5100191 he wasnt tough enough with his team when i want someone to go i simply tell them and then thats that you have to be tough about it
5100192 isnt as good as he thinks he is not by a long chalk
5100193 it is clearly significant that he has chosen to register this halfway through the investigation it is a welcome move
5100194 we are about much more than just keeping in touch we are about making people more productive in their business network
5100195 imagine you had all the students at oxford trying to access the web through a single uk household connection
5100196 for the first time people in the region will have an on ramp on to the global internet highway
5100197 for a country to be without fibre optic links today is like being without a harbour in the past you are landlocked
5100198 the speed that knowledge currently moves in africa is 5mph walking pace but with decent connectivity knowledge will travel at the speed of light
5100199 upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was a dying land but it was not yet dead and here things still grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
5100200 i f you ever do want to kill yourself but lack the courage i think a visit to palmerston north will do the trick
5100201 het begin was erg zwaar en daarna kwam een loodzware klim
5100202 boven op de berg was het mistig en viel er miezerregen
5100203 when i heard our fans giving him stick i said to someone that the worst thing they could do was boo him
5100204 hes one of the greatest goalscorers english football has ever seen
5100205 i cant understand why i got that abuse to be honest
5100206 in the two years i had here i gave my all but thats football supporters for you isnt it theyre pretty fickle the best way to answer them is to come on and stick the ball in the back of the net and thats what i did all the abuse i got was a massive inspiration to me and the southampton fans should have realised that it made me want to come on and silence them
5100207 i never said i didnt want to come here i said i never wanted to leave sunderland
5100208 some players can crumble and collapse after the manager gives them a bollocking
5100209 a lot of the players who have gone down with the club found it difficult to get their heads around it
5100210 there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster and we have shown before we can come from behind
5100211 we lacked width and penetration its a handicap maybe and in the context of the season its not the result we wanted but with the changes we had to make you couldnt be too disappointed
5100212 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him
5100213 but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available we were the better team we had the most possession of the ball but we didnt make it count in the second half
5100214 we got a point where a lot of people didnt think we could
5100215 ive said to the players if we can come here and do that we can do it anywhere because this is the toughest place in the league to come
5100216 now hes said it i think that with dennis wise tony jiminez derek llambias and mike ashley in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5100217 i definitely want one or two and i dont know what the wow signing is myself and i cant wait to ring him ashley its a shame he told the corporate members before he let me and the assistant manager terry mac mcdermott know but thats alright
5100218 it was the perfect start and more than i expected
5100219 but well need more quality in the future if we want to be champions well need more than this
5100220 i think the owner will be happy like the other fans
5100221 everything wed worked at in training for the last 20 days we did out there on the field portsmouth didnt think wed play like we did because we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team they didnt expect us to play more aggressively than last season but i dont think manchester united will be scared they are not our opponents next week after all maybe wigan chelseas next opponents might be
5100222 i told him to make people believe in him and he did that
5100223 their movement was too much and we couldnt stay with it they play from everywhere and we just stood and watched them i made a rod for my own back by buying two strikers in jermain defoe and peter crouch and i had to play them theyve not come here to sit on the bench but i dont think you can play 4 4 2 here you get overloaded in midfield and thats what happened to us
5100224 ive turned down the opportunity to go elsewhere before and im happy where i am
5100225 its not a case of the grass being greener its difficult at the moment ive lost sulley muntaris energy and pedro would have played today if he was still here but well be better than that for sure the top four are on another level and no one will break into that group this year still you dont play chelsea every week weve got a nice easy game next monday against united after all
5100226 he is intelligent he looks to have good acceleration he sees a good vision of the game and that left flank suits him quite well
5100227 he had a bad season last year because he had meningitis he was in hospital for two weeks he didnt recover properly for three months and then they rushed him back to play and of course he was not at the expected level
5100228 the season before everybody wanted him sometimes you have to be brave enough when everybody says he is not good i saw him start his first game and he gave me an impression that you keep with you when you see things you have to go with your beliefs
5100229 it is of course flattering to be compared to zinedine zidane but its also a bit annoying because that is a lot of pressure
5100230 he is the best player of the past 10 years in european football
5100231 when i arrived at arsenal no one told me as well that i was the successor for alex hleb we play very different football i will try to bring my own game here and take the team forward i would rather be known as samir nasri
5100232 there is maybe a bit of robert pires in him because he looks to be able to change direction very easily and he has a little bit the same style of run
5100233 roberts strength was the intelligence of his game not his tackling
5100234 there were not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england
5100235 when i first met the boss he said that i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but i felt really good straight away
5100236 there was a bit more contact than in france but the main change was the intensity of the game and how quick the 90 minutes actually goes
5100237 for the first 25 minutes we showed them too much respect
5100238 there will be weeks when this performance is good enough to get us points
5100239 if we get that extra bit of quality in before the transfer window closes then we can all look forward to the rest of the season
5100240 its not as if i didnt warn him i showed it to him and he seemed ok with it
5100241 i mean the more uncool we were the more real we seemed and we were very real
5100242 we were in control but things changed when alonso came on and started spraying the ball around
5100243 he made a difference hes a threat and the pass he gave for the goal was great
5100244 i was talking to tom hicks and he told me we have the money we are not that far apart if we sell one or two players we have enough money to sign another good player
5100245 i had a player in mind and an idea the question now is why we cannot do it they did not say no before they said no after four months after four months they said the player is too expensive they said we will have to do something else maybe
5100246 i said this four years ago and im still thinking in those terms that way we can save more money and sign the targets we want in my opinion we arent doing all the things we need to do in terms of signing players
5100247 i spoke with xabi and told him we also have mascherano lucas gerrard and plessis in midfield and we need eight british players in the squad
5100248 i need to bring british players in and i need a left footed player
5100249 my players are as disappointed as ive ever seen them and that gives me great hope and belief were going in the right direction
5100250 liverpool will be relieved to have got back on their bus with a win
5100251 i eat there at least once a week and the food is great the staff are very friendly and act like family i agree that someone has a
5100252 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5100253 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5100254 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5100255 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5100256 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5100257 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5100258 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5100259 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5100260 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5100261 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5100262 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5100263 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5100264 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5100265 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5100266 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5100267 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5100268 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5100269 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5100270 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5100271 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5100272 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5100273 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5100274 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5100275 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5100276 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5100277 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5100278 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5100279 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5100280 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5100281 the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation
5100282 parents experience lower levels of emotional well being less frequent positive emotions and more frequent negative emotions than their childless peers
5100283 in fact no group of parents married single step or even empty nest reported significantly greater emotional well being than people who never had children its such a counterintuitive finding because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life and theyre not
5100284 if you admit that kids and parenthood arent making you happy its basically blasphemy
5100285 from baby lotion commercials that make motherhood look happy and well rested to commercials for disney world where youre supposed to feel like a kid because youre there with your kids weve made parenthood out to be one blissful moment after another and its disappointing when you find out its not
5100286 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack

5100288 my left eye will not see again but i have another eye soon well be working together again
5100289 the sudanese government remains responsible for massive atrocities in darfur
5100290 to suspend the icc investigation in response to khartoums outrageous threats and empty promises would be to betray the victims in darfur
5100291 we would have liked to move ahead with the project
5100292 but we saw that the preparations are as of yet insufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out more detailed work
5100293 undoubtedly turkey has allies undoubtedly turkey differs with iran on many issues but we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to
5100294 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
5100295 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
5100296 i never met anyone or accepted any money from anyone in regard to the accusations directed at me
5100297 why would anyone document a bribe this document cannot possibly be proof of bribery would anyone include two witnesses in a contract that involves bribery it is not logical
5100298 the document distributed to the press by k l daro lu was not evidence of bribery it was a protocol signed by four people it aimed at preventing mr di li from losing his savings which he took out on loan from a private bank as is known very well by chp mayors one doesnt need help from a third party in order to buy a piece of land that a large scale investment through which the region i was born and raised in would gain a large shopping center is being abused in a political row between the ak party and the chp by chp officials is very saddening
5100299 we have no personal problems with anyone we dont accuse anyone on groundless claims the proof of bribery bears di lis signature
5100300 was the deal between di li and akademi ofset not signed in exchange for helping the company buy a piece of land if not why didnt di li distribute the documents to the press
5100301 an entrepreneur whom the uk retailer paid 13 million for a prime site near stanbul is accused of bribing a leading politician of the governing ak party with 1 million to push through an ambitious planning application
5100302 the platform will be discussed next week during a visit to baku we hope that azerbaijan will accept it and that the new cooperation platform will help in settling ethnic conflicts in the region
5100303 if we were all georgians and russia were invading our country and killing our people we would be in a state of war clearly that s not what we want john sometimes hes a good person but he is a little bit given to this bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than defuse them
5100304 i dont think ed balls has any concept of how damaging he has been to this school he should have been in the hall last night when my staff were expecting 150 parents to the new year seven evening and got 50 he should have been in that hall when i had to tell the pupils their school wasnt going to shut down in 50 days
5100305 in my nigerian school i couldnt talk to a teacher you asked too many questions and they beat you
5100306 cynthia isnt one in a thousand most kids here have a story this school gets a rough ride but is getting better
5100307 there were very very dark days when my eldest boy was told hed come here i nearly had a nervous breakdown no way did i want him here there would be 10 to 15 police vans outside the school how could i let my boy go into that but now thats starting to change its very gradual
5100308 its not difficult you need three things to turn a school around sort the behaviour out sort the teaching out then give it some time you cant get these kids through english gcse in a year you need five years of sustained work thats what the government doesnt understand
5100309 beggar the poor boost the rich policies or a capitalism for the poor socialism for the rich economic model that american financial authorities have adopted over the past two decades
5100310 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
5100311 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
5100312 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
5100313 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
5100314 perhaps it was from the north vietnamese for a couple of weeks touring nlf propaganda films around england i didnt ask where the money or the films came from and if that was a kind of treason by negligence so be it i was glad to help my cause
5100315 had i been recruited it hardly seemed to matter to me
5100316 would be enough to feed us pay for petrol and have a comradely beer with such masses as we would find
5100317 i didnt ask where the money or the films came from and if that was a kind of treason by negligence so be it
5100318 he was not accused of corruption or selfishness he was the underdog who won he wrote some poems he died just young enough ho is ageless

5100325 i have a 5 year old daughter and at that moment i thought im really glad she didnt come with me
5100326 the adults gasped and almost all the young children started crying
5100327 im sure some rational thinking scientists think its a bad thing
5100328 of course its fun but thats not really the ultimate goal
5100329 its engaging visitors to see other things in the museum and experience the real thing
5100330 they were taking it through its paces and it was mind boggling
5100331 we were creating what the story could be so you could build scenes with action rising to a climax and a resolution
5100332 they like being in on a unique one time thing
5100333 it is a big dinosaur but it isnt school bus sized
5100334 a little archaic in their movement because in general we now think dinosaurs were all very active and agile creatures
5100335 its almost impossible for somebody creating a show like this to keep up with the science because it changes all the time
5100336 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5100337 if your mother tells you she loves you check it out
5100338 i have to put it down as an error by richmond
5100339 the alternative isnt worth thinking about i will continue to speak out if i feel my team has been treated in an unfair manner but ill just put that one down to a mistake
5100340 we did enough to win the game but just couldnt put the ball in the back of the net
5100341 reserve the square inch plot for your descendants to till
5100342 get out your paper and pencils i am going to tell you the three most important things you will ever need to know about raising children example example and example
5100343 the value of time the success of perseverance the pleasure of working the dignity of simplicity the worth of character the power of kindness the influence of example the obligation of duty the wisdom of economy the virtue of patience the improvement of talent and the joy of originating
5100344 the air bill error rate is really killing us would you please take a couple of your stations and ask the employees there to figure out a way to improve the accuracy to at least 99 5 percent when they succeed id like to use their approach as the model for our entire worldwide system
5100345 we did even better than you expected there were only 51 errors all month out of the 21 000 air bills submitted

5100348 cheat to win the honest way to break all the dishonest rules in business
5100349 it is evident that the 21st century consumer is more sophisticated than ever and actively seeks information prior to making purchase choices including the selection of legal representation
5100350 this recognizes that consumers are best served when they are given more not less information about lawyers
5100351 there are some regulators in other states who yearn for the clubby old days when lawyers didnt have to compete in the free marketplace like other businesses
5100352 they law amp politics do peer reviews and that is a verifiable fact
5100353 the supreme court has always been wary of restricting free speech on the grounds that people are too stupid to understand what something means
5100354 that one issue in texas generated more revenue than the total revenue of law amp politics in minnesota and sister publication washington for an entire year
5100355 we said weve got to expand before others figure this out
5100356 i know our colleagues read it and if youre not there your absence is noted
5100357 id be hard pressed to tell you one piece of business that came to us because of being a super lawyer but we do it anyway
5100358 i didnt become a better lawyer in 1998 than i was in 1997
5100359 it seemed the less i practiced law the better lawyer i became i never understood that those that slog in the trenches and represent poor people are never on that list
5100360 in the beginning it was a simple poll now we look at 17 to 18 factors
5100361 its a great way to get recognized lawyers are always looking for an edge
5100362 theres a tremendous amount of money being spent in the legal marketplace to interact with one another
5100363 not every lawyer can be super or the best you have splashy ads that tell you how great individual lawyers are we want to empower consumers to handle that legal information with confidence
5100364 he was in the wrong place at the wrong time he got out of a taxi went for a pizza and he was eating the pizza as he walked up the road
5100365 weve done our best to rear him and it paid off he was a very good son
5100366 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5100367 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5100368 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5100369 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5100370 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5100371 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5100372 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5100373 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5100374 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5100375 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5100376 the 2006 census shows where there is an imbalance its not an extreme one
5100377 i am concerned about the gender imbalance but not issues such as looks thats pretty superficial
5100378 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5100379 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5100380 we will go through the video and talk to our members
5100381 he is not a person we want as one of our fans
5100382 its not the character of this club its disappointing we will find out who he is and ban him for life i apologise to the manly club
5100383 if they are the supporters of the game then what hope do we have its sad you dont expect that from rival fans
5100384 we are aware of it well let the authorities handle it if you are asking whether it was a concern yes it is a concern
5100385 it was attitude plain and simple we need to have a good hard look at ourselves
5100386 we thought that was a big chance of that happening everyone watched the melbourne game and knew how much manly put into it and that it would be hard to back up
5100387 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5100388 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5100389 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5100390 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5100391 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5100392 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5100393 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5100394 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5100395 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5100396 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5100397 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5100398 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5100399 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5100400 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5100401 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5100402 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5100403 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5100404 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5100405 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5100406 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5100407 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5100408 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5100409 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5100410 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5100411 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
5100412 since i was 17 years old i have been performing on the opry circuit in texas

5100423 the notice for the informational meeting that was held for the public on this matter was mailed out in a t mobile envelope and looked just like a solicitation
5100424 this is ron mayor of downers grove and in response to the comment that
5100425 this is marshall from the dg58 board and i want to note
5100426 after all if its a majority viewpoint theyre looking for those council seats would be sitting empty
5100427 in the last four months the dgreport has logged just short of 100 000 hits from 3 000 different computers
5100428 ideas for blog topics can be sent to jerry moore at
5100429 as to the supposed greater audience commanded by free newspapers im not sure thats the point it seems to me that the desire of citizens to read and comment online as well as the blogs efforts to bring stories to light that the newspapers wont touch is what is truly important
5100430 all that high cost special ed program did was make dg a target for families with high cost special needs kids to move here
5100431 madrigosa deserved a far better fate you did what had to be done but this battle is far from over
5100432 lets stand up for tv talking about the positives and all the great stuff
5100433 the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe
5100434 dr thaksin shinawatra to help communicate his vision and aspirations for the club
5100435 my experience is exactly the opposite and id rather make a judgment based on my experience than some theoretical hypothesis my job is that i run a commercial organisation so i dont deliberately do things that are bad for it commercially i might make a judgment error but so far we are the number one in the uk so we must be doing something right
5100436 listen im an agent not a principal if people think someone is a dictator then thats his problem and not mine i believe that everybody is entitled to their advocate i would never ask anybody here to do something which they were morally or ethically opposed to when we did a job for the norwegian government on whaling a number of people didnt want to work on it and i said they didnt have to
5100437 or try not to would probably be a more honest way of putting it
5100438 because im clearly a conservative and take the conservative whip in the house of lords everybody assumes that i run my business on the basis of being a conservative which is absolute rubbish
5100439 there are people here who represent the labour party the liberal democrats the green party
5100440 i do travel a lot i probably go more to the middle east than anywhere else i go to washington a lot and to various places in eastern europe and the occasional trip to south america
5100441 sky really began that process what sky did was introduce the concept of consumer empowerment
5100442 i would find it very hard to give good advice
5100443 she is a symbol of the hatred of the left
5100444 no because im older but i love my job and it has got better not worse i think ive got better at it because ive got more experience and because its more interesting now dealing with the mobile phone and the internet is a really interesting challenge and has had a real structural effect on our industry
5100445 i have to embrace digital technology because it would be stupid for me not to its not easy because im old and all the faces in the digital world are young but theres an inbuilt assumption that people who are young use the internet and people that are old dont its not true
5100446 our experience is that whatever the turbulence in the stock market whatever is being said about gloom and doom in the economy its not showing up in our figures
5100447 although people are having difficulties over credit and so on they are still using communications to talk to people about it whereas in the last downturn they said its a nightmare im not going to say a thing until its over
5100448 unfortunately a large number of people in our industry are not in it because they want a career and they want to understand how it works they just want a job they want to work for the least number of hours for the most amount of money our industry is populated by a lot of people who really arent very interested in what they do
5100449 on the other hand our role has become more important and people at the top of the business are contributing a hell of a lot more than they used to theyre invited to the top table because the discussion about how you are going to communicate something is almost as important as what youre going to communicate
5100450 the people i least enjoy working with are the people who really do take themselves seriously it makes relationships so difficult

5100456 a multiplatform approach where breaking news blogs discussion strands and all the other attributes of a website sit alongside a print partner which needs to take the time and have the space to develop explain comment and analyse the major themes of our profession

5100462 sodium bicarbonate is safe extremely inexpensive and unstoppably effective when it comes to cancerous tissues its an irresistible chemical cyanide to cancerous cells for it hits the cancerous cells with a shock wave of alkalinity which allows much more oxygen into the acidic cells than they can tolerate cancerous cells cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen sodium bicarbonate is for all intent and purposes an instant killer of tumors
5100463 the use of the young phorever phour mineral salts is the ultimate protection against all illness sickness and dis ease including any aging or cancerous condition the phour salts can not only improve health and energy but atheletic performance
5100464 all enervation under performance aging and cancerous conditions are caused by a four letter word acid which is an acronym which stands for a acidic food and drink attitudes and activities c compromised internal acidic environment i illness and dis ease and d desire for more acidic foods drinks attitudes and activities and the cycle repeats itself we ingest acidic medicines to lessen the symptoms of our illness we stimulate the body with unhealthy forms of energy providing quick often temporary relief from our symptoms which begins the cycle all over again creating a very powerful pattern of poor health and dis ease
5100465 during the olympics in athens greece and now in beijing china several top athletes have improved their athletic performance and even broke world records using sodium bicarbonate
5100466 some athletes relied on more rudimentary and legal means to boost their race times including using a substance tucked away in a kitchen cupboard or in the back of a refrigerator
5100467 beijing will probably be remembered for the abuse of legal aids
5100468 if you took out the participants who experienced negative side effects youd see an average improvement in running times of about 2 2 seconds
5100469 essentially sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance that increases the ph of the blood
5100470 this seems to reduce and offset the acidity produced in the muscles during intense anaerobic exercise that produces lactic acid most quickly such as fast running or swimming
5100471 at the last olympics the top four swimmers in the mens 200m freestyle were separated by just 1 4 seconds
5100472 so in theory it could be the difference between winning a medal and not
5100473 the increments of improvement are relatively small to the average person although significant to someone who competes
5100474 patients receiving sodium bicarbonate achieved urine phs of 6 5 as opposed to 5 6 with those receiving sodium chloride the alkalization is theorized to have a protective effect against the formation of acids that may cause nephropathy
5100475 an extremely simple therapy used by physicians to treat autism is to supply a mild antidote that neutralizes the excess acids
5100476 substituting a sodium bicarbonate solution for saline infusion prior to administration of radio contrast material seems to reduce the incidence of nephropathy
5100477 the most effective measure to treat rt induced mucosititis in patients with head and neck cancer is frequent oral rinsing with phour salts to reduce the amount of oral microbial flora
5100478 for uncontrolled diabetes and circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration extracorporeal circulation of blood cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis take sodium bicarbonate
5100479 earlier and more frequent use of sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher early resuscitability rates and with better long term neurological outcome sodium bicarbonate is beneficial for cpr
5100480 sodium bicarbonate is useful in prevention and reversal of neurological disorders
5100481 if the bodys blood and tissues remain alkaline at 7 365 to 7 4 it is susceptible to no illness sickness or dis ease this is what i refer to as true immunity and true prevention
5100482 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
5100483 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5100484 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5100485 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5100486 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5100487 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5100488 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5100489 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5100490 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5100491 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5100492 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5100493 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5100494 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5100495 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5100496 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5100497 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5100498 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
5100499 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5100500 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5100501 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5100502 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5100503 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5100504 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
5100505 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5100506 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5100507 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5100508 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5100509 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5100510 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5100511 were all considered financial niggers by the banking cartel now
5100512 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5100513 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5100514 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5100515 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5100516 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5100517 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5100518 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5100519 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5100520 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5100521 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5100522 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5100523 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5100524 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5100525 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5100526 ecco io faccio un patto far davanti a voi a tutto il popolo prodigi quali non sono mai stati fatti su tutta la terra n in alcuna nazione e tutto il popolo in mezzo al quale ti trovi vedr lopera delleterno perch tremendo ci che io sto per fare con te
5100527 do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before swine lest they trample them underfoot and turn and tear you to pieces
5100528 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you
5100529 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
5100530 it is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and we certainly see that in play here but at another level it is somewhat annoying when you see the over the top rhetoric they utilize and at some level you get mad
5100531 hope to stimulate discussion and action that will stem the tide of state sponsored idiocy that threatens to overwhelm britain
5100532 i do not think that the government has any idea of the impact its recent legislation will have on volunteer groups
5100533 reassure all volunteer groups that the government is listening to them and does understand how difficult it can be to deal with regulation
5100534 we are working with voluntary groups to take action to ensure that unnecessary burdens are removed and necessary ones minimised regulation is not about lack of trust in those whose contribution we so greatly value it is about stopping the few people who would use a position of trust to harm those who need our care
5100535 responding to concerns from community groups about the costs and difficulties in finding an individual volunteer to act as premises supervisor
5100536 volunteers are reluctant to take on this role which means many premises are relying on temporary permissions to allow alcohol sales
5100537 the changes will make things easier for village and community halls helping them to continue providing a valuable service to their communities
5100538 you go to the giant the super fresh you go to the 7 11 and youll find something that is natural or organic the same this is happening with green building materials
5100539 the better your home performs the less youre spending on energy and the more you can devote to your mortgage which means you are less in jeopardy of losing your house
5100540 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects
5100541 a new china day was born its not just a daily record high but chinas total of golds surpasses sydney and athens a magnificent china day
5100542 im extremely happy and proud today because we have made a breakthrough in the rowing history of china
5100543 the chinese delegation must remain clear headed because according to the competition schedule most of the teams events are in the first half
5100544 this is the main reason that china has been leading the gold medal count
5100545 this year the assortment of big summer movies hasnt been that different from other summers in recent memory
5100546 so why has the summer of 2008 seemed exhausting in a way previous summers havent
5100547 the most important element of summer blockbuster culture isnt the selling of movies its the selling of anticipation because the amount of time we might spend looking forward to a big summer movie is almost always longer than the shelf life in theaters at least of the actual movie
5100548 the schoolboys who kill a peasant for the thrill of it are ours the prosecutor in the courtroom who trembles in fear that he is not sufficiently liberal is ours ours administrators men of letters oh there are many of our people a tremendous number and they themselves dont know it
5100549 have sent target letters to six blackwater worldwide security guards involved in a september shooting that left 17 iraqi civilians dead indicating a high likelihood the justice department will seek to indict at least some of the men according to three sources close to the case
5100550 on whether to indict may not be made until october about a year after the incident
5100551 americas video game expo is an annual gaming destination where gamers and industry insiders come together to celebrate videogames
5100552 with nbcs local media involvement in vgxpo we expect to reach thousands of gamers and offer them an absolutely fantastic experience and provide them with content that they wont be able to find at any other gaming event
5100553 intel is thrilled to be involved with the exciting global growth of esports and electronic sports league esl to host the first intel extreme masters continental finals americas at vgxpo
5100554 the intel extreme masters competition will showcase americas best counter strike 1
5100555 from our viewpoint vgxpo and videogames overall provide us with the ability to engage an audience that we havent been able to traditionally reach with tv
5100556 our goal with lunar tide and vgxpo is to draw a huge audience to the expo and to develop additional videogame marketplaces
5100557 most gamers have favored platforms genres and games which they are very passionate about and when theyre not playing theyre increasingly turning to trusted online communities devoted to their specific interests
5100558 having mygamercard net join our publisher group underscores a big part of our mission here at giant realm which is bringing together the most authentic and influential online communities devoted to videogaming passion points
5100559 with an a to z that cuts across many of the top communities we can deliver millions of young men in masse for advertisers we also have the ability to reach more targeted audiences based upon specific gaming interests were proud that mygamercard net has chosen to join our publisher group to help us broaden our reach of these audiences
5100560 there is an obvious connection between our audience and others within the giant realm publisher group
5100561 the companys laser focused strategy will clearly benefit us and give us the resources necessary to further develop our technology and community
5100562 to recover your expenses plus some profit for the next round of vote buying
5100563 one of the big problems they now face in other countries is the people in power want to reserve the money keep it for themselves so they exclude young able people who wants to join their team
5100564 the result is there is no talent inside the existing parties
5100565 in other countries elections do not put up a division one team they are a division three either a b team or a c team in charge in singapore we carefully select our candidates
5100566 over the years with each election we see the quality of the mps their education levels their competence their abilities their energy their youthfulness is renewed and we have a leadership thats able to meet the rising standards of the population
5100567 is it that simple you vote in a division three government not a division one government and the whole economy will just subside within three four years finished
5100568 even in the face of a global recession singapore had enough long term investments to buffer the setbacks
5100569 why are we on top of our problem because theres a government that is planning ahead seeing ahead calculating ahead making the right decision
5100570 buy meat and poultry raised without nontherapeutic antibiotics use milk produced without recombinant bovine growth hormones and replace unhealthy snacks found in many vending machines with healthy choices
5100571 food has biochemical benefits beyond just calories having the freshest food available to preserve the bioactivity of those nutrients is very important for healing sick patients
5100572 fresher tastes better and is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables
5100573 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5100574 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5100575 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5100576 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5100577 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5100578 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5100579 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5100580 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5100581 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5100582 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5100583 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5100584 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5100585 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5100586 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5100587 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5100588 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5100589 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5100590 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5100591 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5100592 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5100593 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5100594 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5100595 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5100596 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5100597 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5100598 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5100599 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5100600 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5100601 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5100602 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5100603 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5100604 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5100605 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5100606 sinceramente eu acho que muito cedo para que isso tudo termine mas infelizmente s o coisas do destino que n o est o ao nosso alcance

5100665 obama says he supports marriage between a man and a woman but of course he says he opposed the marriage amendment in california
5100666 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer shows up the hypocrisy in his position on that issue
5100667 i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage
5100668 he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage and so he needs to keep twisting and turning diving on that issue and it is hypocritical
5100669 john mccain without hesitation bang life begins at conception he gets it the judges that he would appoint he made it very very clear i think he also resonated with beyond the base to those who are pro life even within the democratic party i think it was exactly what needed to be done he said it exactly the way it needed to be said

5100701 recent amendments to the sex discrimination act in april have strengthened the protection from sex discrimination not just at work but also in the wider world from businesses who discriminate against individuals in the goods and services they offer
5100702 where a man and woman have the same haircut and the same skills are required the salon is acting unlawfully to charge them different prices there does not appear to be any justification for the cost difference
5100703 where the service is truly the same so should the price

5100716 fay could be approaching hurricane strength when it reaches western cuban tonight and when it approaches the florida keys monday
5100717 theres no order for residents to evacuate the area we have to wait and see the situation before taking more measures
5100718 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5100719 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5100720 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5100721 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5100722 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5100723 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5100724 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5100725 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5100726 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5100727 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5100728 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5100729 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5100730 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5100731 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5100732 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5100733 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5100734 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5100735 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5100736 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5100737 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5100738 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5100739 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5100740 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5100741 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it

5100745 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence

5100748 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5100749 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5100750 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5100751 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5100752 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5100753 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5100754 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

5100763 i am a businessman and just dont have any of that political ambition
5100764 from outside people can make any statement they want but those investors who actually come here realise that cambodia is a place where they should do business
5100765 it might seem strange but i dont think hell ever move from here perhaps its a mix of feng shui good luck and superstition

5100785 even without the dogfighting case michael had been the victim of some very flawed advice by a number of professionals who were supposed to know what they were doing and were supposed to be helping him

5100787 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5100788 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children

5100795 the developers have really taken care to provide extensive depth and content which could make this game one of those that stays on gamers hard drives for a long time

5100800 the aipla has done a good job of looking out for the interest of the large corporations i hope that under todd it will also look out for the interests of the small corporations the individual inventors venture capitalists patent practitioners etc
5100801 ironically one of the companies that has reportedly relied most heavily on outsourcing of patent preparation to india to save is general electric ironic because the head of ges patent dept is none other than former commissioner q todd dickinson who unlike certain more recent commissioners actually had years of experience in ip law before becoming commissioner one would assume that someone of his experience and stature would have looked into this issue before outsourcing work to india just to satisfy corporate beancounters
5100802 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5100803 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5100804 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change

5100808 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5100809 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5100810 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5100811 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5100820 she was shocked to be named one of peoples 100 most beautiful people this year
5100821 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
5100822 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
5100823 when i went with my parents and brother to see
5100824 ive bought a couple of those houses already that hes building you can build a house for us 150 000 which is amazing so i bought two of them and plan on buying more as theyre doing an amazing thing ther e
5100825 there is a tendency to make fun of people who get involved in these sorts of things brad went there builds houses he can do a lot of other things with his time

5100831 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
5100832 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way
5100833 the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
5100834 to suggest ive given the project my seal of approval
5100835 ive even heard that theyre going to put new songs in
5100836 where are they going to get the songs from whos going to do that thats a bit strange isnt it
5100837 cambodia definitely had one of the most advanced music scenes in asia at the time
5100838 it is amazing that a lot of it survived at all
5100839 the khmer rouge destroyed everything related to the music scene they could get their hands on including trashing all the recording studios and destroying all the musical recordings they could find
5100840 when i first heard this music i did not think much of it
5100841 the more i listened the more i realised just how different and edgy this music was
5100842 thailand vietnam and laos did not have this scene it was unique to cambodia
5100843 this exposed cambodian musicians to jimi hendrix phil spector the doors
5100844 meanwhile from europe we got latin styles such as cha cha rumba and flamenco
5100845 in the khmer community in long beach california you cannot go down the street without hearing this music
5100846 for them it was about memories of cambodia in the good times
5100847 i remember seeing the tapes of artists like sisamouth and sereysothea for sale in the phnom penh in the nineties
5100848 i did not really pay any attention to the music until i bought a computer to learn design i stumbled on music editing software and started messing around with sampling khmer music
5100849 soon i was started going out and combing the markets listening to every song i could find from this period and i started to mix and sample them
5100850 the first reaction i had from people was shock they thought it was blasphemy and did not understand why i wanted to do it
5100851 i started remixing old music for fun but now it has become a real mission trying to remind people now just how creative people were back then
5100852 in the next five years we are going to see a real explosion of the arts in cambodia particularly in music
5100853 i hope the pre war songs will be part of that
5100854 to what lengths would this girl go to satisfy her own obsession with herself

5100859 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5100860 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5100861 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5100862 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5100863 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5100864 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5100865 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5100866 innovation has nothing to do with how many r amp d dollars you have when apple came up with the mac ibm was spending at least 100 times more on r amp d its not about money its about the people you have how youre led and how much you get it

5100869 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5100870 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead

5100883 if we suffer with him we shall reign with him
5100884 if thou be the christ come down from the cross
5100885 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5100886 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5100892 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5100893 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5100894 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5100895 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5100896 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5100897 i understand when we have 50 groups supporting our bill and you only have one it gets a little annoying but we will see if we can find one other group to support your bill i doubt it but we will try
5100898 i dont think that any bank that goes to the extent that ubs has gone through to avoid doing what their agreements with the united states require them to do should be allowed to continue to do business unless they clean up their act
5100899 the imperial presidency of george w bush and possible legal responses
5100900 i welcome todays announcement that the president has reversed course and dropped his adamant opposition to a timeline for redeployment of american troops from iraq
5100901 the president should begin a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from iraq so that we can meet the many other challenges we face around the world starting with taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan the people who actually attacked us on 9 11
5100902 the minute the story got out about america at long last trying some diplomacy towards iran oil prices fell ten percent theres a good reason for this a lot of the price per barrel america has been paying for oil is the risk involved in bushs saber rattling towards iran when that danger premium on the price is seen to recede then the price itself recedes i guess president bush is finally coming around to barack obamas way of thinking too bad it took this long and were paying so much now at the pump for bushs intransigence
5100903 its interesting to me that senator john mccain is proposing a gas tax holiday which he originally wanted to take effect at the beginning of the summer the reason its interesting is that since then john mccain hasnt managed to make it to a single senate vote leadership requires your presence senator mccain if a gas tax holiday was so important to you why didnt you return to the senate and make it a reality or is this just a cheap campaign gimmick meant to fool voters
5100904 i dont want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf i feel i owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as i can with them and i think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal
5100905 president bush said a few months ago and i quote playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signals i guess that standard doesnt apply to wealthy fundraising events for john mccain where you can pay five thousand dollars to have your foursome greeted by president bush i guess he should have told the troops playing golf during a war sends the wrong signals unless youre a wealthy republican donor as it would have been more accurate
5100906 im astonished that john mccain has kept phil gramm as his key economic advisor after his comments about america being a nation of whiners and that the recession is all in our heads we learned last week that the swiss bank which employed mr gramm as vice chairman is probably guilty of wholesale defrauding of the irs of tax moneys by helping the wealthiest of the wealthy in america hide their assets in swiss banks is this really the man john mccain wants giving him advice on the american economy more to the point is this really who american voters want giving economic advice to our next president
5100907 the wife of the republican candidate for president against expressed her elitist disdain for the average people of her state cindy mccain who stands to reap who knows how much money from the anheuser busch buyout said in an interview recently quote the only way to get around the state is by small private plane unquote must be nice for her although i would be willing to be that most arizonans cant afford the luxury of ditching the family car for a private plane as i said the elitism shown by her statement is just breathtaking how many private planes do the mccains actually own and why has no one asked them this question yet
5100908 bush started the ball rolling in his last year of office and made it possible for obama to succeed therefore bush deserves the credit
5100909 its really hard to do a new album after the stuff we where saying on the first one after we hate the kids then what do you say we still hate them that statement about rocknroll
5100910 hot damn look at her ass and look praise the lard the christian hypocritical cameraman is lingering on that ass look at that thats according to my ass watching timer a full 10 seconds he stayed on sweet paulas ass damn if i were a christian id be down there in tampa right this minute paula looks like a much better lay than pastor melissa scott though you know my sentiments goin her way
5100911 yeah i gotcha i dig but im talkin about jt obama what in the fuck is wrong with him trying to win the truly ignorant amurican vote why is he afraid of shot down john
5100912 oh i have no doubt that senator mccain has a great chance and if joe lieberman were to oh that would be such a great political move or tom ridge whos another man hes considering but yes i definitely feel the people trust john mccain as commander in chief and are a little bit afraid of obamas inexperience when it comes to foreign policy

5100922 my mother used to tell me that it was red like blood and opened like a twirling skirt
5100923 it grew like a person grows only in one place with tiny fingers that pushed their way beneath the earth
5100924 and between the small twirling skirt and the earth fingers ran a long thin bone only it was soft but crunchy like it had been left out after heatrise only it wasnt dry it was wet inside wet when you crunched it
5100925 no my rose there were as many as there are stars in the sky
5100926 yes when the father who guards the boundaries gives us back all that we have destroyed and even more
5100927 when will he forgive us when will he give it back
5100928 at the end little rose when the hammer stops rising and all those who have shared their water with the village are given it back again it will be as it was at the first only better and ours forever the whole world covered in roses of all kinds and water flowing everywhere for everyone

5100944 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5100945 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5100946 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5100947 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5100948 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5100949 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5100950 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5100951 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5100952 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5100953 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5100954 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker

5100976 there is no doubt that the lawsuit was not to harass or cause the defendants problems but rather it was to get them to participate in a problem that was being confronted by the people of this state
5100977 the attorney general made a choice to accept the costs associated with this lawsuit when he filed it
5100978 preposterous that these corporations that a jury found poisoned tens of thousands of kids in our state would attempt to get money from those who tried to hold them responsible

5100983 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
5100984 the current arrangement of filing reimbursement paperwork to recoup costs associated with excess baggage is an undue burden on our servicemen and women who are bravely entering or leaving a combat zone
5100985 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have re evaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders

5101001 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5101002 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled
5101003 how do you measure the effects of virtual distance in a flat world what about the actual practicalities of managing a globally distributed workforce
5101004 remember where you came from where youre going and why you created the mess you got yourself into in the first place
5101005 the mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy what the caterpiller calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
5101006 we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5101007 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5101011 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5101012 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5101013 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5101014 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5101016 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5101017 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5101018 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5101020 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5101021 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5101022 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5101023 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5101024 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5101025 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5101026 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call

5101029 there is no terror in a bang it is only in the anticipation of a bang
5101030 im going to ask identical questions to each of these candidates so you can compare apples to apples now senator obama is going to go first we flipped a coin and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5101031 confirmed that mccain did not hear or see any of the broadcast
5101032 we were in motorcade until 5 30 et then a holding room in another building with no tv
5101033 he was in the cone of a secret service motorcade
5101034 i do not think there is a moderate and non moderate taliban this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan
5101035 there is no separation between taliban as moderate hardliner or others

5101039 a number of critics have accused the unaids and who of distorting figures in the past to push for increased funding to fight aids
5101040 this seems an unnecessary and petty position the fact is the evolution of hiv prevention treatment and care over the past quarter century is one of the great successes of medical science

5101043 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5101044 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5101045 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5101046 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf in vitro fertilization and even the so called rhythm method

5101053 now this hospital and staff has a good understanding of the navajo tradition and what it takes to heal you have to consider the entire person family and culture
5101054 the navajo way of describing body parts is to use sheep the main meat source on the reservation
5101055 weve provided a lot of education on body parts and how they can be explained our staff jumped right in there

5101060 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5101061 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5101062 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5101063 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4
5101064 but thats just marketing real innovation of products is different it takes much more structure
5101065 some children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds do not experience risks in such positive challenging or exciting ways for them risk taking can refer to threats to their safety including the threat of violence
5101066 risk taking can also refer to young people experimenting with drugs and alcohol public parks are sometimes the sites where this activity takes place
5101067 the ambiguity which results from this could lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding particularly given recent reports and media concerns about cotton wool kids
5101068 its government talk for we have to be seen to make sure this happens
5101069 some questions might be raised about finding space for this in central london boroughs for instance it might be difficult but that is very much a council by council issue

5101071 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5101072 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5101073 you need the willingness to fail all the time you have to generate many ideas and then you have to work very hard only to discover that they dont work and you keep doing that over and over until you find one that does work
5101074 the switching costs for people to leave a league to come over to another site is a significant hurdle

5101080 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5101081 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5101082 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5101083 that is what he is crying for we cannot ignore that
5101084 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
5101085 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5101086 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5101087 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5101088 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5101089 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5101090 we have been saying that the im has emerged with this new name but is an old organisation
5101091 the statement has been given by the gujarat police but nothing of this sort had come out in our probe
5101092 what we want to do is make sure that all of our members their family members and all of our u s citizens residing outside the united states have an opportunity to vote
5101093 absentee voting can be done by mail there are also some alternatives that weve been working with the states for electronic alternatives for our voters
5101094 so many states have passed legislation that allows a voter to submit voting materials by fax or e mail
5101095 we want to give the citizens as many opportunities as many alternatives as possible that are allowed by their state law to communicate with that local election office
5101096 we want everyone to participate in the voting process our servicemembers their family members and all of our overseas citizens
5101097 it is voting outreach to let them know that they are eligible to participate in this democratic process
5101098 so it is up to the voter to decide what they want to do
5101099 we want to make sure they have the information and the means to do so if they choose to vote
5101100 the purpose driven life hosted both presidential candidates on saturday evening in a uniquely formatted meeting called
5101101 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5101102 i think the opposition to the war in iraq was a tough decision ive had to make
5101103 not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussien was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill but i was firmly convinced at the time that we didnt have strong evidence of weapons of mass destruction and there were a lot of questions that as i spoke to experts kept coming up
5101104 the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early
5101105 and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5101106 i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple of years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape so i said no now in full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget giving my last answer and a high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was thats not the only tough decision ive ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life

5101121 in other words there is no record of the transcripts
5101122 was this ordered by ayd n do an as well
5101123 all of us as alevis sunnis kurds and turks are members of the same nation we will continue to be the members of the same nation and no one will ever be able to divide us
5101124 hac bekta veli yunus emre taptuk emre and ahi evran are the philosophers leaders and entrepreneurs who helped us to make anatolia our homeland
5101125 everything is just like it was then we were living in a two storey building our apartment did not collapse but the five storey building across the street fell over ours someone should put a stop to poor construction it upsets me that we are still unaware about earthquakes
5101126 our pains have been revived today our biggest expectation is to not live such days again
5101127 our institute continues its research in cooperation with three other scientific institutions we are trying to figure out turkeys sensitivity to earthquakes we also share information on novel developments in other countries
5101128 they say they have been struggling to raise disaster consciousness in the public for 100 years in japan and we are just at the creeping phase
5101129 there is no planning in turkey we dont see any steps being taken in logistics or coordination either
5101130 turkeys 10 big cities face earthquake risks which reveals the seriousness of the situation we know that we cannot totally prevent the damage but we have the chance of lightening it
5101131 these projects are among the biggest projects in republican history in terms of participation scope and budget a total of ytl 23 million has been allocated for these projects
5101132 they did not provide the slightest piece of information about karata who was being treated at a hospital in arnhem for several months and this is unacceptable and unjustifiable likewise belgian authorities attitude concerning the terrorist erdal cannot be explained by human rights or law how can you justify the protection afforded to terrorists who killed innocent people these two countries are openly violating the european convention on extradition
5101133 their hands are stained with blood as they sold their ideology to terrorism it is very disconcerting that an organization that was subcontracted by the international terrorist and fascist ergenekon organization can still be called a leftist organization
5101134 we discuss the performance of our athletes but the olympics represent a big international organization how many turks are working for this international event
5101135 there are so many international organizations that do not employ any turkish citizens there are only individual cases of employment however even small european countries have made it an official policy to train personnel for such organizations in our country neither the state nor the nongovernmental organizations or universities do this we are nonexistent in these organizations but do we have efforts to sponsor athletes i am unaware of any institution that sponsors athletes for international sports events do we provide facilities for education and training facilities for our kids who have potential for success at the olympics
5101136 i know this is an easy question for all you beautiful minds but
5101137 hey its a computer it must be easy to figure out
5101138 i dont know what is going to happen with all of this
5101139 since ive been living there my back got worse my knees got worse
5101140 i had blood tests going back to 2004 and 2005 showing my white blood count high nobody knew why
5101141 i couldnt walk talk or anything starting last october right after the heat went on
5101142 then we bring up the christmas tree from the basement and it smelled terrible
5101143 said to be rare but one of the most toxic molds there is
5101144 or other molds are found in a building prudent practice recommends that they be removed
5101145 tenant is complaining of severe mold condition in the basement and in the living space
5101146 tenant has obtained estimates from a mold remediation company a waterproofing company and a doctor all of which state a mold issue exists
5101147 mold clearance report by an engineer or accredited agency be obtained
5101148 the parallels between human obesity and canine obesity are striking
5101149 they live with us so when we eat too much they eat too much when we dont exercise enough they dont exercise enough and when we snack between meals they probably snack between meals
5101150 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5101151 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5101152 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5101153 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5101154 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5101155 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5101156 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5101157 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5101158 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5101159 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5101160 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5101161 we know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands the man who says i know him but does not do what he commands is a liar and the truth is not in him but if anyone obeys his word gods love is truly made complete in him this is how we know we are in him whoever claims to live in him must walk as jesus did
5101162 i will love you as long as you satisfy my every need and love me in return if you are no longer meeting my needs i am so out of here
5101163 therefore as gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another forgive as the lord forgave you and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity
5101164 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and
5101165 the lord rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness
5101166 the lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me
5101167 but as for you be strong and do not give up for your work will be
5101168 this requirement cannot be met by the current 4 5 inch 11cm gun which is limited in range and precision the team at bae systems land systems barrow in furness is making good progress and has already designed some elegant engineering solutions making the return of a 6 inch 15cm naval gun look more viable as each phase progresses

5101181 a number of actions for transporting aid assistance to georgia are being considered and a lot of them are already happening
5101182 we are talking with turkish officials and they are also very concerned about the situation of the georgians we are currently in cooperation with turkish officials and we are also considering more ways of cooperation
5101183 as far as i know we have not made a formal decision about sending those two ships
5101184 we have been in coordination with all those willing parties countries for transportation of humanitarian assistance to the georgians we have been very helpful concerning all kinds of requests for either plane or ship passage
5101185 it is an international and multi party convention it is not up to turkey to make exceptions according to the conjuncture of whether it is a humanitarian situation
5101186 we intend to be delivering more and we are doing it by listening to the georgian government
5101187 the united states is in the process of making other arrangements for aid to the georgians which may involve dispatching a smaller coast guard ship which complies with the regulations of the montreux convention
5101188 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5101189 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5101190 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5101191 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5101192 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5101193 we thought about what we could do after such a disaster and we saw that there are many things that we can do we have numerous units conducting research on the environment we are examining the area
5101194 for the love of money is the root of all evil
5101195 the reason why i was so emotional is that i have dreamed of a lot of things and written things down
5101196 this was the biggest thing i have ever written down thinking of all the things i have done to get here everything i have gone through
5101197 my mom and i still joke about the fact i had a middle school teacher who said i would never be successful
5101198 i saw my mom for a minute and we hugged she started crying i started crying my sister started crying
5101199 what impresses me the most is his comments in the press conference and how he expresses himself

5101203 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
5101204 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
5101205 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
5101206 for the first time we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits
5101207 over geologic time the eruptions have clearly moved up and down the lengths of the tiger stripes
5101208 astronomers have wondered for a quarter century whether these voids were too big or too empty to be explained by gravity alone
5101209 our analysis shows that the voids in these surveys are exactly as big and as empty as predicted by the standard theory of the universe
5101210 when we used galaxies brighter than the milky way to trace structure the biggest empty voids we found were about 75 million light years across

5101225 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain

5101227 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5101228 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures

5101260 there will be nights where ill fall asleep with my ipod on
5101261 i know exactly where irene hogg was coming from i want to save people from the same fate the system needs to change one teacher i know was absolutely destroyed by a negative inspection report people are frightened to speak out
5101262 it is not the paperwork that is important it is the children and that has been forgotten about when my school was inspected i told hmie it was the worst week of my entire career there is no redress for headteachers who are being criticised i was told by the local authority not to argue with the inspectors
5101263 future headteachers are already in schools watching heads and seeing what pressures they are under and there is not a big enough financial incentive for them to want to take their place the isolation and accountability of the headteachers role seem to be among the biggest deterrents
5101264 there are many headteachers who take early retirement around inspections but i imagine that has always been the case and always will be the council might encourage or push folk to early retirement but people might think they have been slogging their guts out for years only to be told it is not good enough
5101265 over the past six years vacancy figures have fluctuated as expected in line with the number of retirements a draft report is expected towards the end of 2008
5101266 the fringe was well warned about bringing in an untested system if theyre talking about trying to get a new system up and running after october its far too late
5101267 the fringe needs to adopt an existing box office system that is successfully in use elsewhere
5101268 this is the most comprehensive and transparent review process into how we sell fringe tickets that has ever been undertaken
5101269 well feed the findings of the inquiry and it review into the wider debate on the fundamental role and operation of the fringe society
5101270 everyone on the fringe needs to work much better together and the fringe society needs to concentrate on getting back to basics
5101271 perhaps it shouldnt be getting involved in events like fringe sunday which ties up a huge amount of time and resources there has been no real change in how the fringe is marketed for several years now that desperately needs to change
5101272 the fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world but is currently run on rules and regulations drawn up in the 1950s its very quaint but has to change
5101273 there needs to be a root and branch review so that the fringe becomes much more representative of the actual venues and gives them a proper voice which just isnt happening at the moment
5101274 there has already been some talk about having an extraordinary general meeting in the winter and i think a one day conference into the future of the fringe would also be worthwhile
5101275 there should be associate membership available to the likes of performers and its also important that stakeholders like the city council and the scottish government are given a say
5101276 there is a general malaise which has afflicted the fringe society and at the moment it really lacks credibility with a lot of people
5101277 it needs to be much more responsive to the needs of artists and performers and concentrate on how it can help them more than it does at present
5101278 which two kingdoms were merg advertisement ed in the act of union of 1707

5101280 the past becomes increasingly intriguing as people mature i dont get the same sense of enthusiasm from the younger population
5101281 its heartening that after decades of politically driven teaching and mickey mouse empathy exercises most people still have a vague idea of what happened when that suggests an enduring appetite for history in general and for the rich drama of our national story in particular
5101282 clearly our education system is equipping scots with a sound knowledge of history whats particularly significant about this poll is that despite many of these questions being solely about english history scots were more likely to know the answers than their counterparts in england
5101283 to build on the knowledge and interest that already exists this government wants the teaching of scottish history to be an important part of the history curriculum so all children are better able to appreciate scotlands fascinating past and our place in the modern world

5101288 we really have to ask ourselves if we cannot find a way of getting some kind of compromise which would get relatively immediate succour to at least a section of the population and by working together actually drive that through the parliament

5101291 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it it fell to the ground in pieces
5101292 the twin engine aircraft which had lost its right propeller banked to the right it seemed to gain some height for a short period then it dropped down behind trees
5101293 within a few seconds we heard a loud rumble and that was the end of it
5101294 four of our employees were returning from a routine survey flight under air traffic control when another aircraft flew into it
5101295 the pilot had been flying for many many years and had a wealth of experience they were four highly respected and very well qualified members of the team it is just a terrible tragic accident
5101296 i saw a plane coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5101297 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5101298 a search took place and we located two scenes of wreckage one towards coventry and one in brandon wood approximately one mile apart
5101299 there are five confirmed fatalities all persons have now been accounted for one in a single engine aircraft which came down just towards the coventry side of the hotel and there are four confirmed fatalities relating to the twin engine cessna which came down in brandon wood
5101300 as far as i am aware the single engine aircraft disintegrated pretty much in mid air debris is spread over a wide area
5101301 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5101302 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft we believe the light aircraft was also hoping to land at coventry
5101303 the collision was three miles out on the approach i had been watching the twin engined aircraft doing some approach and go arounds just before
5101304 like all pilots it makes me shudder when i think back about the times i have seen another shape flash by me in closer proximity than i would have otherwise have liked
5101305 i knew one of the pilots and a more professional and skilled pair of hands you could ever wish to meet the news is terrible a brilliant future brought to a sudden stop
5101306 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
5101307 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5101308 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5101309 even i did not imagine we would be third in the medals table i thought we would improve significantly from tenth but third is special
5101310 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance
5101311 our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain and we look forward to another great week of british sporting success
5101312 this is far beyond anyones expectations at this stage and one of the most notable features has been the extraordinary success of britains sportswomen this team is the best prepared ever and sets a standard for the run up to our own games in london in 2012 and the glasgow commonwealth games in 2014
5101313 i want this olympic period to be the time when the place of sport in society is changed forever
5101314 success at the very top does inspire people to take up sport britain has got much more serious about sport in the last ten years weve got to take this momentum and take it to a new level
5101315 it was more interesting to do it as a sport than trying to be a hired gun
5101316 other people became for a while for a couple of contemptuous words a proletariat we were an aristocracy of two
5101317 mean girls on telly and got wine vintage lohan the day just got better
5101318 perdibles lo que no genera dramas siempre se piensa en ganar obvio pero si perdes con un grande la herida cicatriza rapido pero lo que ocurre es que el hincha estaba euforico por el debut triunfal ante b nfield de visitante y la derrota ante el santo lo devolvi a la realidad
5101319 well maybe he shouldnt no one should be good at everything other people should have victory not just phelps
5101320 which all makes for a different kind of look at politics and which hopefully introduces a few new things or perspectives into the debate occasionally
5101321 involved a complex restructuring which in practical terms is not achievable
5101322 the bigger the danger that the situation will deteriorate and the policy choices will become more difficult and unpleasant
5101323 threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5101324 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5101325 every single chinese athlete winning a medal will be in adidas on the podium
5101326 the moment for chinese fans is when the gun goes off and when he crosses the finish line if lius in first place the whole nation will go completely insane with excitement and he will be wearing swooshes
5101327 if you want to lead globally you have to lead in china
5101328 we expected the olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool but the opposite has been the case the market hasnt matured to the stage of the us or uk in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong if you can tie liu xiang or yao ming to your product that has a big impact
5101329 other countries are interested in the olympics but in china well over 90 of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved
5101330 for us its about connecting with athletes we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates
5101331 theyre a lot cheaper but the style and technology of adidas and nike are better i usually buy nike for running but a lot of the adidas casualwear looks really good
5101332 china has 400 million under 20s who are watching the olympics and falling in love with sports most people in china still are not playing sport when it does catch up wow
5101333 the fed has no idea how bad it is out there
5101334 la intensificaci n de controles entre capital federal y provincia y el haber cambiado la fisonom a de los desarmaderos
5101335 hubo un incremento en el n mero de robos parciales seg n nos comentaron las aseguradoras aunque nosotros no disponemos de datos concretos y ello demuestra claramente que se busca la comercializaci n de autopartes sin importar el origen
5101336 on the nose i found cream white pepper tropical fruit cantaloupe peach and flowers the wine was very aromatic i also loved the pale straw color of the wine in the mouth the wine showed pineapple peach citrus and melons the wine was surprisingly crisp and very refreshing we quaffed it on an unusually warm winter evening in the dc area on its own and it was perfect
5101337 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5101338 i held him and held him because i simply did not want to let him go
5101339 i wanted to hold him forever so that all who knew him could come and mourn him
5101340 as i stood with the soldiers nearby i heard the russian warplanes coming we threw ourselves at the ground
5101341 then the bombs fell and the earth shook i am a god fearing man and i prayed
5101342 the russian jets came over in several waves their bombs falling between the houses hitting people who didnt have anything to do with fighting who just happened to live in this country
5101343 as they banked away i saw black smoke rising from the apartments where my brother lived i started to run over the smoking earth
5101344 i ran through the rubble looking for someone alive i was convinced that zviadi still lived
5101345 i searched left right all over i didnt even notice when i tripped over him
5101346 he had shrapnel in the chest blood ran from his ears he had no pulse
5101347 one must write such things and such things must be read because otherwise humans will never understand what war means
5101348 georgian soldiers wanted him to go with them but i wouldnt allow him to go he was a part of me we had spent all our lives together
5101349 he keeps putting his hands to his ears and keeps on diving beneath the bedclothes as if he hears the bombs raining down
5101350 so i wrapped him in one of my shirts and buried him someplace where i hope the bombs wont get him again
5101351 litter is a real issue across the network but motorway slip roads often bear the brunt as drivers slow up and toss their fast food wrappers crisp packets apple cores and juice bottles from their cars
5101352 with the volume of vehicles on the network every day the quantities quickly stack up its an ongoing battle to keep the routes clear and looking tidy and we really need drivers help to achieve it
5101353 not only is littering unsightly and dangerous if blown into other vehicles it can also be harmful to wildlife
5101354 the entire westbound verge was strewn with the most horrific assortment of shredded garbage that looked like giant confetti from a wedding in hell
5101355 clearing large volumes of needless litter on the trunk road network is a burden on the public purse and on the resources of our operating companies
5101356 its a shocking indictment on the people that drive or are passengers they have an attitude that its perfectly acceptable to throw litter out of the car i think its ignorant they wouldnt like it dumped in their back garden
5101357 the most annoying thing about road litter is that it is wholly preventable all motorists have to do is take their litter home or use a bin
5101358 its unbelievable the amount of waste that drivers throw out of their windows i can be out blitzing an area and almost as fast as im collecting it up more is gathering the slip roads are usually the worst
5101359 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5101360 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5101361 relieving chronic pain may just be the most misunderstood concept in healthcare unfortunately the story of specialist pain services in scotland is one of chronic failure it mirrors all too often the experience of patients being fobbed off with even higher doses of painkillers and the promise of future help which never materialises
5101362 one of the problems here in scotland is that the service is fragmented
5101363 people have to go all over the place to find appropriate services for them there is not equal access for everyone
5101364 from my meetings with people who are living with chronic pain i take the message that what counts most is having their pain recognised and to be cared for by professionals who project a sense of empathy and of optimism that the pain can be managed
5101365 because we recognise this as extremely important to patients and their families the scottish government has accepted the recommendation from nhs quality improvement scotland that chronic pain should be recognised as a long term condition in its own right
5101366 it was a well rehearsed procedure by the crew when they found they could not contain the leak after just a little water had got in they closed all seven watertight compartments and allowed the central one to flood
5101367 its good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help
5101368 everyone is fine and recovering from their ordeal the below decks area was sealed off and the crew put on lifejackets and assembled on deck as part of standard procedure it was a textbook operation by the skipper he did everything correctly by the book
5101369 honey i need your help i wrote a thing for my friend put it on my laptop and sent it to myself then tried to print it on the pc and it is all messed up

5101375 after the construction of the road the number of trekkers will be reduced we have a trade off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment we need to create alternative attractions to just trekking
5101376 we are trying to create man made tourism attractions like theme parks adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting
5101377 will mainly go to a few specialised tour operators and some more expensive hotels
5101378 although there will be some trickle down of profits for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty
5101379 there will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night is this the way we want to treat our planet
5101380 despite the credit crunch weve just had our best ever summer sale

5101387 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5101388 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5101389 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5101420 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
5101421 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq

5101438 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5101439 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5101440 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5101441 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5101442 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5101443 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5101444 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5101445 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5101460 the instability is of course causing concerns in pakistan but it is also not in the interest of pakistans western allies
5101461 the west is uncomfortable with the situation none of the people waiting in the wings to replace musharraf represents continuity to them
5101462 they realise that the presidency has been stable only when the military was in power or when there was a strong political government like pakistan had in the 1970s under zulfikar ali bhutto
5101463 are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
5101464 musharraf had been the first choice of the west but now they have understood that musharraf will have to go
5101465 while there is a great deal of uncertainty there are very few people who believe that this war on terror will be managed by any other than the pakistani military

5101489 a large influx of renters into these developments can raise concerns that include falling property values difficulty in selling units and less favorable lending terms when the time comes to finance structural improvements associations also worry that their units will become less marketable since many lenders stop offering their best mortgage terms to buyers when the number of renters approaches the number of owner occupants there is a risk that investors will sell several units at once pulling down values overall said encinitas based real estate agent marc zimmerman ceo of pineapplehut inc real estate researcher russ valone of marketpointe realty advisors said he has noticed an increase in rentals among condo complexes within the county 3 560 condominiums that were once offered for sale became rentals between the third quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2008 valone said nearly 90 percent of those were apartments that had been converted to condominiums as of jan 1 2004 there were 143 067 condo units of all types on the county tax rolls he said of those units 64 508 or 45 percent didnt have homeowner tax exemptions on jan 1 this year the county condo total reached 174 039 he said just over 81 000 or nearly 47 percent lacked exemptions

5101554 obama senior following the prescripts of islamic sharia law divorced
5101555 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
5101556 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
5101557 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family
5101558 what would be heard by most listeners is that obama hates the military so much that he might leave the united states defenseless against our enemies
5101559 i did not see my brother practice islam especially after he came back from his studies in the united states
5101560 there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing
5101561 obama did attend a government run public school in indonesia and he did receive islamic instruction including study of the koran
5101562 barack obama is not and never has been a muslim
5101563 that physical description does not match the indonesia television news videos showing the house
5101564 it is hard to decipher what obama might be trying to hide by not being clear about the specific location of the houses where he lived in jakarta
5101565 the black man who tried to peel off his skin
5101566 advertisements in the negro magazines still hymn nadinola skin bleach lightens and brightens skin
5101567 the entire episode suggests what psychologists call hypothetical lying in other words imagining something that has not happened but imagining it with so much precise detail that the made up memory functions for the person as if it were real
5101568 has obama lost the ability to tell the difference between something that actually happened and something he invented
5101569 after the date obama wants us to think he left indonesia
5101570 the puzzle just adds to the growing list of factual discrepancies or outright fabrications that obama manufactures very likely on an ongoing basis

5101572 men fear death as children fear to go in the dark
5101573 in politics what begins in fear usually ends in folly
5101574 i must not fear fear is the mind killer fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain

5101612 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5101613 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5101614 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5101615 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5101616 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5101617 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5101618 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5101619 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5101631 when i wanted the corners i missed when i threw over the plate they hit it hard since i was a little kid ive wanted to pitch in this ballpark but it hasnt been kind to me this is not a game you want to go through it leaves a bitter taste
5101632 they got off to a three run lead and it was time for us to answer the call
5101633 if we dont get going maybe we dont win i think 3 4 5 in the lineup have to produce for us to win
5101634 you dont see it too often but its a fun game offensively it gives everyone a chance to contribute moose made some great pitches to get out of that second inning and we took it from there

5101636 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5101637 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5101638 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5101639 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead some shops nearby were damaged he said
5101640 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself

5101652 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome
5101653 our concern was that it would spread beyond those unoccupied homes into a grassy area and beyond
5101654 we were fully committed to containing the fire within that subdivision
5101655 i dont know how much that contributed to it but certainly it was different from when you have homeowners taking care of their homes

5101657 i wish i could go off for about eight weeks and do nothing but write then i could get something done
5101658 believe me you dont know what you are asking if you ever have eight free or uninterrupted weeks to do something that means you have lost your job broken your leg or are recovering from a heart attack
5101659 whoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not reap
5101660 as you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed a in a mothers womb so you cannot understand the work of god the maker of all things
5101661 there are so many things i need to do how can i find the time to do them
5101662 rot in hell are one of the most exciting and raw hardcore bands out there today
5101663 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5101664 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5101665 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5101666 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5101667 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5101668 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5101669 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5101670 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5101671 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5101672 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5101673 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5101674 he has had a terrible spell with injury we are all disappointed for him but he will have to come back again
5101675 s qui n es ese chico alto de ah atr s
5101676 we want to speak to children and get the message across to them that if they get into trouble when they are young it will affect the rest of their lives
5101677 the psni officers are guiding us on how best to go about setting up the scheme and have expressed an interest in getting involved by talking to the kids about the dangers of drugs
5101678 myself and paul would hope to talk about crime and the consequences sharing our experiences with the school kids
5101679 all i was interested in was drinking and fighting and i had this great big chip on my shoulder
5101680 i was rioting with the police and throwing petrol bombs at them everyone in our area was doing it at the time
5101681 my life was never normal until i was 36 and gave my life to jesus
5101682 since then i have got my driving licence bought my first car and my first house and even been on holiday for the first time
5101683 up until then i never cared about anybody else and i say this regretfully not boastfully
5101684 i have three children in belfast who dont want anything to do with me and i cant blame them as i was never there when they needed me
5101685 i am not proud of my past and i cant change it but i can change my future and only with the help of christ who sacrificed everything on the cross
5101686 i had been carrying out robberies for the sake of it from i was in my early teens when i left home and lived in that derelict house i had to steal to get what i needed
5101687 i started carrying out attacks for the paramilitaries rioting and so on and in return i got to stay in their houses for periods of time
5101688 i never actually joined any organisation but was always on the fringes
5101689 i was 19 and it really hit home that jesus loved me and died for me and wanted to give me a real life a full life
5101690 i decided something would have to be done and i got some boys together to carry out a robbery in ballymoney
5101691 i was going to use the money to buy a weapon to shoot jonathans killer it was my intention to get involved in the feud to get my revenge
5101692 if i hadnt been caught and sent to prison i am sure i would have done murder
5101693 in maghaberry i wanted to be a tough guy and a real menace and spent most of my time in the punishment unit
5101694 i had a lot of anger in me and although i knew my life was in a mess i thought i was in control
5101695 we want to help give these people a second chance
5101696 we want them to know there is somebody there who cares about their families and helping them get back to normality
5101697 we will be setting up a drop in centre in lurgan and on the shore road in belfast to offer a cup of tea and to help them fill in forms
5101698 and as many of them have literacy problems we are looking at the possibility of having a teacher coming in to do adult education i have been in their shoes and i have been where they are who better to talk to prisoners than ex prisoners
5101699 as well as hopefully giving practical help for us one of the most important parts of what we are doing and what we hope to do with the prisoners and school children is to help people to see that jesus is the answer to all our problems and that prayer changes things
5101700 we are aware of the proposals being considered and have offered only advice with no other direct involvement
5101701 we would consider getting involved with the scheme and welcome anything aimed at reducing crime and making northern ireland a safer place to live

5101705 i feel like weve been in a situation where weve kind of been just stuck in the middle and i dont want to be where we are in the points right now but in some ways this is an easier position to be in because we just go out there and run hard every weekend and we can take chances and do things that can maybe get us that win
5101706 weve been stuck in the middle where we cant take too big a risk you cant risk fuel mileage you cant risk putting two tires on weve got to stay with four tires and we cant
5101707 youre just trying to ride along there and not make mistakes and now a mistake is made and im just glad we were running good finally
5101708 well the first thing that happened was we just had a bad pit stop that put us back there and we shouldnt have been back there to begin with
5101709 so we just cant seem to get it all lined up this year we finally had a great car and when weve had great pit stops we havent had the car to back us up
5101710 its a pretty disappointing day that got us back there to begin with they were three wide and i came off of turn 4 there and my spotter at the last second said two cars outside of you and it was too late but in looking at the replay there was still enough room
5101711 it just looked like tony stewart kind of came off the wall and touched jimmie a little bit and jimmie came down and there was just no room to move there because we were all so tight coming off there im just more upset that we were back there to begin with
5101712 but this has definitely been a frustrating year up and down and one that only challenges our whole team to see what were made of and i dont see that as a bad thing add comment

5101724 there is clear direction of the need to implement further development guidelines regarding water conservation energy efficiency hill side development and environmentally sensitive land areas
5101725 we are now seeking public feedback to guide development of additional policies
5101726 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5101727 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5101728 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5101729 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5101730 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5101731 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5101732 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5101733 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out he says b c experienced a pine beetle infestation in the early 1900s paula findlay of edmonton won the female junior elite matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner photo contributed by contributed story 41197 aug 16 2008 8 29 pm paula findlay of edmonton repeated her 2007 performance by winning the female junior elite category in the 2008 canadian national triathlon championships in the pushor mitchell apple triathlon in kelowna despite temperatures exceeding 35 c on the day paula improved her time of last year in 58 07 matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner and finished the 750m swim 20km cycle and 5km run in 54 53 competition was very strong in the male category with matt sharpe of victoria in second place in 54 57 third place went to cole stewart of langley in 55 08 one of saturdays competitors at the finish line photo rachael kimola apple try a tri results by contributed story 41196 kelowna and westbank first time triathletes competed in the pushor mitchell kelowna apple triathlon saturday completing the try a tri 300 m swim 15 km bike 3 km run in good spirit and sunny weather results were females 1st 49 33 laura ransom kelowna 2nd 50 03 jodi walsh westbank 3rd 53 28 anna page lumby males 1st 50 04 jared verstaete kelowna 2nd 50 08 aaron wells westbank 3rd 50 54 jim faulkner enderby the kids of steel showed determination and endurance in the 500 m swim 15 km bike and 4 km run in the age group 8 9 years desirae ridenour of cowichan finished first in 21 58 with jordan hopkins of victoria winning the boys 8 9 in 23 13 age group 10 11 was won by cordell dickie of kelowna in 31 30 and courtney chanin of queen charlotte winning the girls in 33 42 spencer burns of powell river 44 40 was the winner in the boys 12 13 section and robynne shannon of vancouver in the girls in 44 44 winner for boys 14 15 was riley maccharles in 47 00 and gabrielle edwards of saskatoon in girls 52 21 the 16 19 age group race of 750 m swim 20 km bike and a 5 km run was won by fraser cashion of port coquitlam in 1 03 39 and allegra rogers of westbank was first female in with 1 11 35 results of the junior elite races will be made available soon with temperatures of mid 30s expected sunday the age group sprint elite and olympic distance races are expected to be very tough by rcmp story 41195 aug 16 2008 7 20 pm rcmp are looking for a suspect after a early morning rape in kelownas downtown core police say that a lone female was walking near the 1400 block of richter street at approximately 2 00 am saturday she was approached by an unknown male and after a brief conversation was attacked and assaulted the male suspect is described as follows caucasian male approx age between 21 25 years of age approx height 5 6

5101737 technical reports underpinning the heathrow expansion suggest that nitrogen limit values near heathrow will be significantly exceeded in 2010 the year in which those limit values become mandatory and that this will be the case even after 2015
5101738 after the construction of the road the number of trekkers will be reduced we have a trade off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment we need to create alternative attractions to just trekking
5101739 we are trying to create man made tourism attractions like theme parks adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting
5101740 will mainly go to a few specialised tour operators and some more expensive hotels
5101741 although there will be some trickle down of profits for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty
5101742 there will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night is this the way we want to treat our planet
5101743 barcelona is the leading example of a city that has got its leaders together and focused on what it wants to be known for
5101744 to a lesser extent liverpool is doing this its decided it wants to be a hip city and it has a plan to achieve it on the other hand leeds and sheffield have similar brand potential but its yet to be developed in a coordinated way
5101745 people are mystified it makes it very much easier for selective schools which dont face the problems those in the national challenge face to get specialist status and extra funding
5101746 it is a new unfairness added to the wider unfairness of the 30 floor target in the national challenge
5101747 its undoubted that being in the national challenge will have damaged schools despite the best intentions the effect of being threatened with closure will impact on these schools for years to come
5101748 we recognise the concern the dcsfs decision will cause some schools but we are confident many of them will meet the floor target consideration will also be given to those that demonstrate good progress towards the target
5101749 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme weve never called these schools failing many are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5101750 it is clearly significant that he has chosen to register this halfway through the investigation it is a welcome move
5101751 itching to flex its muscles and burning with post imperial hubris
5101752 it is quite hard to argue that there is one law for assisting albanians in kosovo and quite another for russians and ossetians in georgia
5101753 the press release is not a common tool of the russian government
5101754 talksport the station that likes to leave its clothes strewn all over the floor when it gets into bed
5101755 were not here to provide a service particularly the bbc does that we are about entertainment and opinions something the audience can react to
5101756 the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan
5101757 i am going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what the country needs now just as margaret thatcher mended the broken economy in the 1980s so we want to mend britains broken society in the early decades of the 21st century its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5101758 he wasnt tough enough with his team when i want someone to go i simply tell them and then thats that you have to be tough about it
5101759 isnt as good as he thinks he is not by a long chalk
5101760 not in response and had nothing to do with mr camerons visit
5101761 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
5101762 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5101763 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5101764 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5101765 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get promises made to different audiences dont stack up he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in the london mayoral election whilst promising the city to do more on infrastructure
5101766 cameron is promising lower taxes more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time
5101767 he pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage inheritance tax and stamp duty savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5101768 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy
5101769 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5101770 i dont think ed balls has any concept of how damaging he has been to this school he should have been in the hall last night when my staff were expecting 150 parents to the new year seven evening and got 50 he should have been in that hall when i had to tell the pupils their school wasnt going to shut down in 50 days
5101771 in my nigerian school i couldnt talk to a teacher you asked too many questions and they beat you
5101772 cynthia isnt one in a thousand most kids here have a story this school gets a rough ride but is getting better
5101773 there were very very dark days when my eldest boy was told hed come here i nearly had a nervous breakdown no way did i want him here there would be 10 to 15 police vans outside the school how could i let my boy go into that but now thats starting to change its very gradual
5101774 its not difficult you need three things to turn a school around sort the behaviour out sort the teaching out then give it some time you cant get these kids through english gcse in a year you need five years of sustained work thats what the government doesnt understand
5101775 heres what i know heres what i dont know what do you know
5101776 or i rather fancy this news would lead one or two to impale themselves
5101777 those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear
5101778 i just bought him a camera im not gonna buy him a hooker too

5101784 up to now there has been just a very light off and on rainfall so much so that last night the people continued celebrating carnival
5101785 okay joey you won what do you want me to do
5101786 even though i won i enjoyed you watching the game with me and i want to make this day memorable to you my main concern is to make you feel wonderful wait here ill be right back
5101787 im not going to tie your feet up yet because i need to remove your panties so for now
5101788 im going to pull your pink panties off with my teeth spread your beautiful creamy legs wide and devour your scrumptious pussy i want you to watch me thats why im raising your head up so youll have no trouble watching my performance
5101789 i said do it i want you to fuck my mouth
5101790 no some other time its mighty tempting next time maybe right now im dying to lick your tasty cream
5101791 yours but being tied up like this and you taking so long is driving me crazy i need something and quick
5101792 we are asking for courage to face these coming days which will probably be more painful than those that have passed
5101793 we must find comfort in one another and in the gift we are to each other
5101794 when i first heard of the accident i said to myself no no this isnt happening then i became angry about the pain you will all be going through
5101795 many questions have come to our mind from this tragedy one of the biggest is why this morning i think you all feel like children asking that question why
5101796 not to worry these children were given wings perhaps it was too early in their lives but they have been given wings and have become angels to look over us
5101797 really really sorry that your supposed friend has turned on you but i told you he would
5101798 really really sorry that your supposed friend has turned on you but i told you he would
5101799 we dont want to discourage companies from making legitimate claims but want to reinforce the fact that they have an obligation not to mislead
5101800 ambiguous or exaggerated claims risk generating scepticism and undermine the genuine initiatives that many businesses including shell are taking to be greener
5101801 that was clearly a misleading claim its those sort of things we have wanted to raise concern about
5101802 the reason we got interested in this is that the number of complaints from on the whole ordinary members of the public about environmental claims for products and services has been going up and up i suspect thats largely because environmental concern is rising generally and so companies are using the environmental angle to put their case forward
5101803 the raison detre for the asa is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product but not mislead people
5101804 on quite a number of these issues there is very little official government or national guidance it would help us enormously if things were clearer at national level
5101805 the green claims points can be included in that revision
5101806 but it wont stop there it will have to be continually looked at because this is a fast moving area
5101807 these complaints are coming from shoppers ordinary people the complaints are virtually all about misleading and inaccurate ads not taste and decency issues this is bread and butter stuff for the asa
5101808 what we dont have is any agreement for advertising on companies own websites if its a direct email to you from a company say with an offer it is covered but if you click into a company website thats not covered
5101809 on the whole nowadays a company which has a marketing department has executives who know the rules in most cases they are using advertising agencies who know the codes but the website may be being done by someone else getting the people who draw up website content to think about codes may be the way forward the world of advertising needs to recognise there is an issue and needs to address it
5101810 if that is the case there will have to be some sort of adjudication process on complaints it would be a major expansion of work and we would need income to resource that
5101811 there are a few campaigning groups who are arguing that the rules are not strict enough and there are calls for pre 9pm bans on all advertisements for these foods regardless of the programme
5101812 my own personal view is that would be an overreaction
5101813 my view currently is lets see what the consultation provides on this id say that in five years time the way people watch tv may have changed dramatically and the impact of specific advertising slots may have reduced to such an extent it becomes difficult to finance programmes it might have to be through product placement simply ruling it out im not sure im not wanting to take a definitive view at this stage
5101814 nine out of 10 its easy to underestimate the scale of the task it faced there are moments when they need to pay slightly more attention to the content side of their work than the purely economic and competition side but thats a minor quibble
5101815 im convinced by the case channel 4 is making for their need for assistance in some years time they dont need it now i believe they are a very important part of the broadcasting landscape we must look seriously at where that help could come from
5101816 top slicing is not an option i would rule out completely if i was secretary of state and i had 100m of licence fee money to deploy with public service broadcasting values in mind would i spend it on bbc3 or would i spend it on helping channel 4 i think thats a very difficult question for the bbc to answer
5101817 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5101818 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5101819 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5101820 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5101821 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5101822 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5101823 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5101824 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5101825 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5101826 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5101827 given the scale of the problem its going to be very difficult to get on top of this
5101828 gardeners often go through the same stages of grief shock denial anger depression and acceptance
5101829 they are in good company kew gardens has it as have we at wisley
5101830 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5101863 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5101864 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5101865 we hope this storm does not turn into a hurricane but if it does the damage will be minimal
5101866 stronger security for information on mobile pcs is becoming a high demand feature as customers look for solutions to protect sensitive personal and business data

5101868 clearly there is a large amount of investment capital sitting on the sidelines waiting for the dust to settle
5101869 the willingness to invest depends on buyers and sellers drawing closer on their understanding of building valuations in this new more conservative era of risk underwriting

5101876 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
5101877 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
5101878 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
5101879 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
5101880 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
5101881 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5101882 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5101883 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5101884 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5101885 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5101886 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5101887 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
5101888 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre

5101994 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5101995 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5101996 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked

5102014 but vp day is very important it commemorated the end of the war in the pacific and indeed the end of the second world war
5102015 it is far more important than this recently adopted battle for australia which has been supported by the rsl of australia
5102016 it is a tragic loss and a great shame that the sacrifice of so many hunter valley men and women has been allowed to fade away to be replaced by this battle for australia
5102017 vp day has gone now and the rsl sub branches have gone along with the new idea that will see it forgotten
5102018 the rsl sub branches are the keepers of our military history and tradition and they should be encouraging public awareness of important days like vp day
5102019 it is sad that the government has gone along with this battle for australia day event and local rsls have gone along with it
5102020 we in maitland rsl sub branch fully support vp day being celebrated under the remembrance day umbrella
5102021 we believe the battle for australia day brings together a whole series of battles that are not normally commemorated and which saved our country
5102022 i think it is similar to the battle of britain which was a series of major battles that took place over a period
5102023 given time it will bring pride on our city and produce hockeyroos and kookaburras of the future
5102024 long term my goal is to be part of the team for london

5102033 ben wanted to get fit because he was training to get his black belt in karate
5102034 he would normally catch a bus in wet weather but decided that day to cycle to school
5102035 but he died where he wanted to be in the sky and forever free
5102036 i cannot fault the bus driver about what happened this could happen to anyone
5102037 everyone riding bicycles should wear those vests they are light easy to put on and only cost about 5 each
5102038 it would take most kids just 15 minutes to ride to school
5102039 if ben had been wearing such a vest he would have been spotted that day
5102040 it was a shocking day outside we had just come through such a dry spell and ben had never really been cycling in such weather
5102041 it was cold and dark and the roads were slippery in the rain
5102042 i was on my other farm across pitnacree road shifting the irrigator and my sons and i saw the fire about 11 30am
5102043 at first i didnt realise it was on my land i thought it was down the on another farm then as we crossed the road we realised it was on our farm so we drove home and called the fire brigade immediately
5102044 i think someone has lit the top paddock on fire and the wind carried the flames so that a total of five acres which belong to my neighbour and i have been burnt out
5102045 all i was really worried about was my irrigation pump in the river
5102046 i think people have dumped rubbish near the large tree on our boundary and then lit the rubbish for fun people are constantly dumping rubbish on pitnacree road last friday night a car was burnt out and the fire brigade was called again

5102055 when times are good you know you dont lean as much
5102056 let us all admit it floors mainly give and add beauty to ones abode and mostly today home owners wanted to give their flooring the best shot for it complement to the aesthetic appeal that the home could bring saying this people who owned hardwood floors in california were doing everything just to maintain the elegance of hardwood floors just like the hardwood flooring in los angeles ca homeowners mostly say that the hardwood floor in ca gives a perfect and striking beauty to every house with its classy and natural style hardwood floors have been always a choice for most homeowners these hardwood floors are also durable if they are guided with proper care and maintenance quality hardwood can even last for a decade if well maintained hardwood floors should be cared properly because improper care can cause a floor to be warped scratched and it can also cause the floor to be dull looking we can say that those hardwood floors are durable enough but no matter how tough or strong the finish looks there are still factors that can damage your flooring just like dirt moist and etc they can be like sandpapers that spoil the beauty of your flooring and here are the tips to maintain the beauty of your hardwood floors maintenance keep them clean and dry this is very important because like hardwood floors in los angeles ca they can be prone to water and dirt damage and you just cannot use any kind of cleaner on your hardwoods and some commit a big mistake on this task some hardwood floor owners thought that wiping their floors with wet mops in good but this is the exact contrary it is advisable to vacuum your floors frequently another cleaning belief in hardwood floors pertains to oil soaps others thought that again this helps in cleaning hardwood but then again this is not true oil soaps are not recommended for hardwoods because they can cause build up that causes you problems when the floor needs to be refinished and will just leave your floors looking dull when you already notice a build up of dirt it is advisable for you to buy a product made specifically for hardwoods and you should only use it only as recommended by the floors manufacturer to avoid miscalculations damages scuffs and scrapes house pets may damage your hardwood floors with their nails oftentimes animals have this habit of digging into the surface upon which they are walking we cannot ask them not to do that i hope so so to avoid this we should keep our pets nails trimmed we should also protect our floors to protect them from everyday wear and tear even though we say that these hardwood floors are finished it is still prone to damage that is why we must do our part to keep its elegance use rugs to those areas of extremely high traffic to minimize damage and scuffing we can make use of these advices and we can make sure that hardwood flooring repairs will also be minimized

5102069 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
5102070 i think we came out on offense and executed well
5102071 the offensive line did a nice job blocking and michael smith and dennis johnson had some big runs
5102072 what i like is that he came back later called the exact same play and threw a touchdown
5102073 we still need to work on pass rushing and getting people to the football
5102074 i thought we were a little better defending the run today
5102075 we still have to get all 11 guys on the same page
5102076 because of injuries and how young we are the defense will be a little behind the offense for now
5102077 jerry is doing a nice job and has improved a lot since the spring
5102078 hes gotten better at defending the pass which is where hes really improved
5102079 mais dit moi x depuis combien de temps ne tes tu pas lav les orreilles
5102080 the social tools are not in place just to serve the organization they must also serve the people using the tools if adoption and long term use important
5102081 has been a vehicle to get the gold medal i wanted i knew i couldnt reach my potential in rowing
5102082 everybody wants to win no one wants to lose but bex needs to win she loves competition she is built for the job she is very hard very hard on herself sets her targets really really high she doesnt really do silver
5102083 my biggest fear is not doing what i say i can do falling flat on my face today was like d day facing the demons again knowing it was going to be the toughest ride of my life
5102084 i was in the village thinking you are one of the best athletes in your country then you see 6 000 of the best in the world and you are nothing unless you become olympic champion if i hadnt done it today i dont know where i would be probably on the floor dead somewhere
5102085 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
5102086 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
5102087 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive

5102090 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been thorough a process
5102091 the idea for us is to try and get it cleared up today its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players are fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5102092 the boys all watched it this morning and it gave them a lift
5102093 it was a tremendous win by us the courage and togetherness the players showed the way the boys finished the last 20 minutes was extraordinary the guys all stood up today and that led to something special
5102094 i thought we played better than the score showed but there are one or two decisions you make in a game that will decide whether you win or lose we made the wrong decisions at the wrong time
5102095 when things get tough the players will go back to what they know
5102096 the defence set the attitude and when youve got guys putting in gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get momentum
5102097 i think the rate has increased by about 50 times
5102098 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5102099 ben is the best dinghy sailor the world has ever seen
5102100 it will be amazing to be racing on home water
5102101 in many ways it was the best gold medal i have won because there was so much expectation coming into the event its hard to describe the amount of pressure you feel when the conditions the lack of wind are like that i was so very happy when it blew and i could sail my own race
5102102 i would have taken the win on saturday but i am much happier to have raced in a decent breeze and gone out and won it is a much better way to win gold for sure
5102103 i was just thinking do not capsize do not capsize so i was a bit conservative
5102104 when i was a kid all of my generation looked up to him we were in awe of what he achieved and it seems a little bit surreal to be in the position i am in now it has been a long road but i have really enjoyed all of my olympic sailing career whether it has been the games or the journey along the way
5102105 its funny because it is such a sense of relief you really feel like collapsing and saying thank god ive made it
5102106 we have made a big thing of being a sailing unit the yngling girls and myself will keep our boats around the place and we will try to come down and help the rest to bring back more medals
5102107 melhor do que tudo s mesmo o sil ncio melhor do que o sil ncio s jo o gilberto
5102108 oh im sorry to hear that what kind of disease do you have
5102109 oh i dont have any disease at all havent you heard of the earth wind fire and water the four elements well in two days nature is going to exert retribution upon mankind and all of those elements will be unleashed upon the entire american continent the entire american continent all of the 50 states will no longer exist america will no longer exist
5102110 actually its not as bad as that we mankind still have some time to change the situation and to make the future viable as yet but it takes all of us are you ready to commit
5102111 of the people by the people and for the people
5102112 we are standing at the threshold behind which the nbu would let the hryvnia half free float within the currency trading band
5102113 all the games you play on the way to the final and you play the worst one on the day
5102114 when you play that badly with the bat it is just a waste of time turning up all the build up and you turn up and bat like that joke we were just brainless i cant really think of anyone on a tough wicket who was out defending we just werent very smart to be honest
5102115 it would have been nice to put them in a position where they had to take a risk
5102116 there are not many bowlers who are a threat in the middle of games
5102117 not many you can set two or three slips to in the 25th over i challenge you to name a better young bowler
5102118 my day could not have got a lot worse than when i saw the drugs people were here and having to pee in a bottle
5102119 the ground is heavy and very deep hes in now but he has to be a doubt
5102120 its far from ideal and will be totally against him but knowing the horse he is the lads might let him run well talk about it tomorrow and make a decision
5102121 some seriously shrewd punters have been backing new approach which suggests he will be ready to run to his very best at york
5102122 duke of marmalade is a good horse and i firmly believe that a good horse will go on any ground
5102123 he is tough and genuine and will give 110 hes a horse that will die for you he can overcome difficulties and though its a hot contest i dont fear anything in the race
5102124 well see how she comes out of this before we firm up plans she handles that ground well and shes been coming forward well since her debut
5102125 the grounds very soft not many like it and i dont think he really liked it either hes a lovely big horse but hes not the finished article physically hes in the national stakes and hes also a possible for the beresford hes promising but theres a long way to go
5102126 she in the moyglare but shes not a big robust filly well have to see how she comes out of it i wouldnt see her running much this year
5102127 i knew today would be very difficult with casey stoner so strong and his first lap was impressive
5102128 i lost a bit of time with john hopkins in the first corner because he overtook me this time we had the pace with stoner and i was catching up with him i knew my setting and the tyres were working well
5102129 i think i could possibly have beaten him in a battle unfortunately he crashed and then i was ahead with an 11sec lead if he hadnt have crashed then things would have been tougher for sure
5102130 qualifying was really difficult and so i started further back on the grid here i passed many riders and the last seven laps i was comfortable with my pace
5102131 that any competitors started at all was a strong testimony to their pluck and determination
5102132 this may have troubled our foreign visitors for the united kingdom won five out of the seven events
5102133 do you honestly think people would care half as much about william if he was the image of his father instead of his mother
5102134 you can never let yourself think you have won gold we just had to make sure we got across the finish line safely
5102135 it was fantastic it was not easy having a boat one point behind they were an inspiration
5102136 the high point in our campaign was when we got pippa
5102137 it was the hardest thing for us to get pippa to come sailing with us we needed the perfect person to join the team and then we needed money all of those things came at once it meant we could really get the campaign running and then there was a possibility that we could win a gold medal
5102138 i watched the girls win gold in athens and i wanted it too
5102139 it was about watching the wind and the tide and sailing really well as a team
5102140 winning an olympic gold medal means you are the best at what you do in the world and that feeling is particularly special
5102141 you cannot describe what sarah and i have been through for the past four years together and the last two for pippa and us we know we are the best job done
5102142 there werent any tears but we were quite close when we were being towed along the wall and you could see our supporters the rest of team gb parents and it hit home that we have done something really special and we have done it for them
5102143 its a great start for the team and we are in good positions in a lot of other classes hopefully we can make them count
5102144 i think there must be an element of luck here because it is a very difficult venue all the sailors would say that im very glad to have come through it unscathed
5102145 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
5102146 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the line
5102147 hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him
5102148 a lot of people are of the belief that you have to be short strong and stocky to be a great sprinter and usain bolt has defied that he has shown that hes a 6ft 5in sprinter and can run well and break world records he has great starts and its the beginning of something else
5102149 i am definitely not going to say hes the epitome of the sprinter because theres too many different kinds of sprinters that ive admired over the years but the way he drives and his pattern the way it goes together his amazing first 40 metres i give it to him
5102150 i woke up around eleven i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track
5102151 we are getting concerned at the amount of work pharmacists are being asked to do
5102152 we welcome the extra responsibilities but this should be matched by funding without it there is a risk that patient care will suffer
5102153 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5102154 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5102155 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5102156 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get promises made to different audiences dont stack up he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in the london mayoral election whilst promising the city to do more on infrastructure
5102157 cameron is promising lower taxes more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time
5102158 he pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage inheritance tax and stamp duty savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5102159 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy
5102160 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5102161 there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster and we have shown before we can come from behind
5102162 we lacked width and penetration its a handicap maybe and in the context of the season its not the result we wanted but with the changes we had to make you couldnt be too disappointed
5102163 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him
5102164 but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available we were the better team we had the most possession of the ball but we didnt make it count in the second half
5102165 we got a point where a lot of people didnt think we could
5102166 ive said to the players if we can come here and do that we can do it anywhere because this is the toughest place in the league to come
5102167 now hes said it i think that with dennis wise tony jiminez derek llambias and mike ashley in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5102168 i definitely want one or two and i dont know what the wow signing is myself and i cant wait to ring him ashley its a shame he told the corporate members before he let me and the assistant manager terry mac mcdermott know but thats alright
5102169 technical reports underpinning the heathrow expansion suggest that nitrogen limit values near heathrow will be significantly exceeded in 2010 the year in which those limit values become mandatory and that this will be the case even after 2015
5102170 at this stage the patterns emerging still suggest the male victim may have been involved in internet betting scams and the arrangement of false and fraudulent documentation such as travelling visas and professional qualifications
5102171 shes got problems just like all of us have about what happened to my mum
5102172 ive been in therapy not long ago and she has had a hard time
5102173 thats why she has done drugs and why this wedding happened too were all depressed in our family
5102174 u know that amazing ability u have to stuff a whole digestive biscuit in ur mouth well ive just
5102175 where the hell was i when all these girls obviously were at the gym
5102176 they the central bank or part of it are back in the market this is all about the central bank weakening the currency
5102177 today the action of the board of raising the official rate to 4 85 was rescinded therefore the official rate stands at 5 05
5102178 liberalising the exchange rate regime should help to curb inflation of tradeables and in particular commodities such as gas and food which are priced in dollars
5102179 in the first quarter of 2008 nominal government expenditures increased just under 50 percent pushing up public sector wages and sending a highly inflationary signal to the private sector
5102180 loose income policy continues to affect goods prices via second round effects
5102181 the banks board made decision to confirm the change of the rate we are confident that we do everything right and we will defend our position
5102182 there were kids running around and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film and were completely transfixed
5102183 i remember thinking where else are they going to see that not on tv and i thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into childrens lives
5102184 a week later i got a prize and a bonus from a film studio that exactly covered it
5102185 and attention to the project itself people are taking it seriously
5102186 you can see films like this in paris and now you can see them in nairn
5102187 if you come in a kilt for powell and pressburgers i know where im going you can come in free
5102188 and when im off on sundays i miss all his undies
5102189 i would have switched it off if it had been on telly but actually i quite enjoyed it
5102190 usually going to the cinema now is all about guarantees did it get good reviews how is it doing at the box office will i get comfortable seats and be able to buy toxic waste sweets
5102191 going to a restaurant that you trust and saying feed me people are coming not because they know all the films we are showing but out of trust people have said its like going to the pictures as a child being taken and told you are going to love this and you know anyone can do this all you need is some dvds and a space
5102192 for once you can happily look around and actually make eye contact with people its the shared enthusiasm thats so compelling
5102193 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5102194 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5102195 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5102196 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5102197 thats the lazy one the one who expected me to pack her shopping for her
5102198 its mainly hummus and soya milk you wouldnt like it even i dont like it bring it back
5102199 i get zip jammers like you all the time its a well known method of fare evasion
5102200 were on a bus in central london somebody must have a knife
5102201 those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear
5102202 there is an inescapable conclusion that allegations of breaches were founded and penalties imposed appropriately
5102203 do you honestly think people would care half as much about william if he was the image of his father instead of his mother
5102204 on safety grounds we support the 72 hour industrial action to be taken by the rmt starting on wednesday
5102205 they should pay the same as metronet pays safety should come before profits on tube lines agenda
5102206 tube bosses should not jeopardise safety on the underground network by cheapskating on their staff
5102207 rmt members on tube lines do the same work as colleagues on metronet and they have today made it clear that they are not prepared to be left worse off
5102208 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
5102209 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
5102210 tube lines bottom line seems to be that it is ok for its staff to be treated as second class citizens so long as the dividends keep rolling in for its shareholders
5102211 our members are facing the reality of a five per cent inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
5102212 a lot of times we find it easier just to ride the bus
5102213 last night we were eating dinner at yannis we had to park a few blocks away at times
5102214 they drive by us frustrated that they cant find a place to park so they go elsewhere
5102215 i know theyre building condos over here im worried about how much parking is going to be around after that
5102216 i think it would help i think its a good start
5102217 we need more parking down here theres lots of cool places to come and shop and some people a lot of people avoid the area because of it
5102218 its a great idea any time you can get more people down here its wonderful for all the businesses around here
5102219 for younger users the risk of marijuana abuse or dependency exceeds that for alcohol or tobacco recent research supports the gateway dimension of marijuana that its use creates greater risk of abuse or dependency on other drugs such as heroin and cocaine
5102220 the reverse pattern is just as accurate for predicting who might be at risk for developing a drug dependence disorder
5102221 the fda along with the drug enforcement administration and the office of national drug control policy do not support the use of smoked marijuana for medical purposes
5102222 canada is a consumer as well as a producer of marijuana
5102223 give finance the responsibility for marketing measurement since that way the bean counters would be forced to learn about marketing and marketing metrics
5102224 at this stage fosters is likely to be the exception rather than the rule
5102225 there is a good argument that this approach should be increasingly adopted by australian businesses lets hope so marketing will be the better for it
5102226 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5102227 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5102228 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5102229 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5102230 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5102231 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5102232 connor was a member of a loving family he was known to the police but not for anything serious as of yet there is no motive but it is very early days
5102233 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5102234 those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear
5102235 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
5102236 market prices for ingredients such as cocoa corn sweeteners sugar and peanuts are up 20 to 45 since the beginning of the year
5102237 gardeners often go through the same stages of grief shock denial anger depression and acceptance
5102238 they are in good company kew gardens has it as have we at wisley
5102239 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual denver officials werent planning to reveal details about where activists would be detained in the event of mass arrests during the democratic national convention until after the event had started but those plans were quickly dashed this week when cbs 4news reporter rick sallinger not only revealed that protesters would be locked up in a warehouse hoping to pry open the debate agreements soldered together by the obama and mccain camps through the auspices of the commission on presidential debates nader is hosting a
5102240 the way of the world john mccain amp barack obama can take a page out of boone pickens plan to help america solve its gas amp fuel problems
5102241 mark penn the top campaign strategist for hillary rodham clintons campaign advised her to portray barack obama as having a
5102242 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
5102243 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
5102244 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
5102245 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
5102246 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
5102247 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
5102248 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
5102249 what would george bush say if our government announced that it was installing an anti missile system in cuba
5102250 the west is losing the new cold war while hardly having noticed that it has started
5102251 despite the credit crunch weve just had our best ever summer sale
5102252 london is not like rome where everyone buggers off because its unbearably hot and they want to go to the seaside
5102253 theres no great drop in the number of people using trains but the type of journeys they make changes
5102254 we have been advised that one of our aircraft has been involved in an accident and we believe it resulted in fatalities the information we have is that we believe our aircraft was performing a normal approach to coventry airport for landing the collision took place around one minute from touchdown
5102255 they were all our employees that we have known in some cases for many years its a very difficult situation for all of us this is the first serious accident that the group has been involved in for over 20 years we are all extremely shocked at the unexpected tragedy
5102256 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5102257 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5102258 unfortunately when the emergency services got to the casualties nothing could be done for them
5102259 i can have it signed off by the end of today
5102260 gaily they played each summers day warriors both of course
5102261 i remember me and dad were sick when we arrived
5102262 it was a coastal town that they forgot to close down come armageddon come armageddon now
5102263 make me feel the cold grip of death around my heart its quite pleasant though
5102264 correct me if im wrong but if youre on a seven game road trip and you lose the first four games you cant do better than a three and four trip
5102265 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5102266 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5102267 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5102268 ive never been one to race my car around at 2 a m but 1 per mile means i almost never drive at night
5102269 for a late film i ask a friend to take me
5102270 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
5102271 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
5102272 right now ukrainian consumers pay more than any one else in europe for inferior quality milk
5102273 meat is going to fall in price some 30 to 40 per cent
5102274 the ukrainian economy has enormous long term growth potential as industrial efficiency continues to improve financial markets deepen and its structure of production evolves
5102275 wouldnt it be boring if we were all the same
5102276 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
5102277 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
5102278 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
5102279 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
5102280 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
5102281 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
5102282 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
5102283 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5102284 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5102285 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
5102286 why this cant be our obamessiah the one the greatest public speaker of a generation
5102287 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5102288 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5102289 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5102290 when you order your free report here you will begin your free trial membership in triple advantage credit monitoring if you dont cancel your membership within the 7 day trial period you will be billed 14 95 for each month that you continue your membership
5102291 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5102292 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5102293 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5102294 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5102295 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5102296 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5102297 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5102298 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5102299 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse

5102302 continuo a seguire con attenzione e preoccupazione la situazione in georgia e mi sento particolarmente vicino alle vittime del conflitto
5102303 mentre elevo una speciale preghiera di suffragio per i defunti ed esprimo sincere condoglianze a quanti sono in lutto faccio appello ha aggiunto affinch siano alleviati con generosit i gravi disagi dei profughi soprattutto delle donne e dei bambini che mancano perfino del necessario per sopravvivere
5102304 chiedo ha poi proseguito lapertura senza ulteriori indugi di corridoi umanitari tra la regione dellossezia meridionale e il resto della georgia in modo che i morti ancora abbandonati possano ricevere degna sepoltura i feriti siano adeguatamente curati e venga consentito a chi lo desidera di ricongiungersi con i suoi cari si garantiscano inoltre alle minoranze etniche coinvolte nel conflitto lincolumit e quei diritti fondamentali che non possono mai essere conculcati
5102305 auspico infine ha concluso che la tregua in atto raggiunta grazie al contributo dellunione europea possa consolidarsi e trasformarsi in pace stabile mentre invito la comunit internazionale a continuare ad offrire il suo sostegno per il raggiungimento di una soluzione duratura attraverso il dialogo e la buona volont comune
5102306 preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali e economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale
5102307 soprattutto nel nostro tempo che ogni comunit cristiana approfondisca sempre pi questa sua consapevolezza al fine di aiutare anche la societ civile a superare ogni possibile tentazione di razzismo di intolleranza e di esclusione e ad organizzarsi con scelte rispettose della dignit di ogni essere umano
5102308 una delle grandi conquiste dellumanit infatti ha detto proprio il superamento del razzismo purtroppo per di esso si registrano in diversi paesi nuove manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali ed economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale
5102309 preghiamo ha aggiunto perch dovunque cresca il rispetto per ogni persona insieme alla responsabile consapevolezza che solo nella reciproca accoglienza di tutti possibile costruire un mondo segnato da autentica giustizia e pace vera
5102310 they attacked our areas in wadi atron with a massive force
5102311 we are looking for the particular gene or genes rather that may or may not cause diabetes or kidney disease
5102312 everyone is well aware it could be caused by environmental factors like the lack of exercise or poor diet however sometimes it isnt the obese person in a family who becomes diabetic
5102313 there are over 250 000 people detained in labor camps called reeducation through labor
5102314 that system is extremely abusive and a local police officer can without any judicial authority imprison anyone at their whim for up to four years
5102315 people dont have independence of judiciary or press freedom there political prisoners have been executed in the province of xinjiang and people have been tortured imprisoned and hundreds have died as a result of that china executes more people than the rest of the world combined
5102316 more people have been arrested more people have been imprisoned more abuses have been committed
5102317 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region
5102318 the next crisis predicted to cover mainly the persian gulf is the crisis of legitimacy of the monarchies and traditional systems which considering current circumstances cannot survive
5102319 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region
5102320 they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
5102321 those who believe that the current circumstances enable them to expand and exercise control at the expense of the interests of others are mistaken
5102322 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought the accord to a close
5102323 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11
5102324 i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa status of forces agreement ever that the united states has done with any other country
5102325 it is not a closed deal but it is very close
5102326 the agreement also will address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions
5102327 the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
5102328 rather pursuant to the agreement an international humanitarian settlement fund will be established in libya to collect the necessary resources for the claims on both sides
5102329 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries

5102331 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5102332 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5102333 it was july 16 1964 when some new research papers arrived i looked at one realised what it meant and then jumped up and shouted out loud oh shit
5102334 when i came back to work on monday i sat down and wrote a new paper as fast as i could
5102335 i thought it was very important i had knocked a hole in the existing theorems and suggested an alternative
5102336 but i also thought i was right so i set to work to spice it up
5102337 it will almost be a relief when they find it
5102338 it could even be more exciting if they dont because it means all our ideas are wrong and we have to start again
5102339 we split up because i had put my science career above the family
5102340 one time i backed out of a family holiday when we were meant to be going to america then i got on a plane and went to a conference jodie my wife just lost touch with what i was doing
5102341 after the break up of my marriage i think i just lost touch with the things i should have been learning about just to follow up my own work i couldnt keep up
5102342 in just a few years of the early 1970s we gained a much greater understanding of the elementary particles that make up matter and the relationships between them
5102343 those discoveries not only helped build the standard model of particle physics they also showed that higgss ideas were crucial to the whole thing
5102344 i was staggered by the scale of the whole thing

5102352 we all tend to have habitual thoughts or attitudes and we need to be very careful about these often they build up and have a cumulative effect which is immense as buddha said in the
5102353 our mindstream our choice we are the authors of our own future happiness or misery
5102354 thought that we have the opportunity to transform our whole experience of reality

5102358 im so excited for the season and all the opportunities and teams in front of us
5102359 we split somewhat into first and second teams for this setting but i guaranteed the girls that there would probably be changes soon and even today
5102360 when we get closer to the pac 10 season i will develop a true starting team but soccer is a game that takes so much to play we will have players come off the bench and really make an impact for us
5102361 we are going to have to score more goals this season because we might let one or two in against us because of inexperience in the net
5102362 we have really grown since last season and we have some great freshman that will come in and really help us out this year
5102363 i told them the crossbar was not a friend of the green team today
5102364 but it was a friend to yellow thats just how soccer goes sometimes
5102365 we are held them out now because we are preparing for the start of the regular season
5102366 the key topic addressed in this report was the impact of long term low fertility on eastern europes ageing labour force the world bank offered three policy remedies more labour productivity higher participation rates and more migration

5102368 then they turned off the mikes for the all blacks haka so that it looked as if the nzers were lip synching their ritual

5102370 we have 34 hours left for you guys to see seasons five and six
5102371 we owe answers we know the answers that we owe the questions have to begin to diminish
5102372 we know where were going and we know how long we have left to tell the story
5102373 were doing it primarily for the die hard fans of the show
5102374 real life intervened and forced us to end the arc of that character much sooner than we would have liked
5102375 give to the congress information of the state of the union

5102382 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
5102383 we dont know yet how similar they are to the motor neurons in als patients
5102384 while the cells exhibit many properties that are typical of motor neurons we dont yet know whether they will be prone to degeneration that will allow us to mimic the disease in the culture dish and therefore to screen potential drugs
5102385 project a l s has always maintained that collaboration between scientists is the answer to understanding and treating this disease
5102386 we are thrilled to have catalyzed the harvard columbia collaboration that led to this discovery
5102387 therapeutic use of the cells is probably a long way off
5102388 right now there are safety issues with ips cells including a risk of cancer we also dont know how to reintroduce cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial all these hurdles need to be overcome first before we can think about using the cells to treat disease but we can start immediately to evaluate them as a tool for drug discovery
5102389 we are excited to be able to facilitate and support truly important cross institutional collaborations such as this significant research effort by harvard and columbia

5102404 the re emergence of russia as a world power is good news for the re establishment of the imminent khilafah though russia is also a tyrant nation which has shed much blood of innocent muslims in chechnya and other places its rise will serve to break americas grip on the world adding to this the rise of china the world is moving away from a situation where america was reigning supreme to a multi polar world where many powers serve to balance and limit each other
5102405 the goal is to build it into a nationally and internationally recognized design firm
5102406 the reason why you would want to come to iota is that weve got great ideas we have creative solutions that solve peoples architectural needs or space needs
5102407 i think that it does put us at a disadvantage still
5102408 we focus a lot on adaptive reuse in the urban community
5102409 we really like buildings from the city especially the post world war ii stock that has really great structural elements and was designed well
5102410 we have a responsibility to the time and place were in
5102411 we have to preserve the buildings that were there before us and we should build the buildings that are here now to reflect the time and place of our age now
5102412 i always did have a strong ability to visualize things how they were going to look and be but i guess i didnt know that everybody else didnt have that
5102413 the international work is fun but its very important to be doing work here in minneapolis and locally as well
5102414 i appreciated her ability to think outside the box to see through issues and potential hurdles in a creative and different way than other design professionals and to do that expeditiously and stay within budget
5102415 i really admire what judy has done with her company the young fresh energetic staff that she has that i think is in many ways beyond its years in their creativity and their abilities
5102416 she has a knack for finding good people for finding good projects and for harnessing all the magic in her profession
5102417 the point of having that is that its supposed to level the playing field

5102421 right now her marketing and sales efforts are really strong
5102422 we think it will give us an edge but it doesnt not in the real world
5102423 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5102479 this figure is bound to increase as growing cities coincide with escalating food shortages to create a squeeze on agricultural water supply
5102480 while it may be theoretically forbidden it is unofficially tolerated
5102481 i am worried about the toxins especially heavy metals accumulating in foods like root crops
5102482 but often there is simply no other water in many ways it is a great use of the waste and the nutrients it contains
5102483 even without expensive infrastructure common sense measures can make wastewater irrigation safer
5102484 i know what ill be miserable for the rest of my life
5102485 they hang there the stars like notes on a page of music free form verse silent mysteries swirling in the blue like jazz
5102486 i would not have wished my illness on my worst enemy depression is not the same as feeling down or fed up people might say im a bit depressed today but true depression is quite different
5102487 my mind was pulling itself apart in a hundred directions
5102488 then came the pictures in my head specific enormous terrifying images
5102489 we were out in the field but i didnt have a clue what was taking place around me and i was supposed to be captain
5102490 what did i have to worry about i had always been someone who coped but depression doesnt care who it attacks if it wants you you cannot beat it off with a cv or a bank balance
5102491 all the same feelings of irrational fear despair and panic that had taken over my whole being in baroda came back wave after great wave
5102492 on october 18 the troll tracker posted what are seemingly his most pointed comments about the case
5102493 i got a couple of anonymous emails this morning pointing out that the docket in esn v cisco had been altered one email suggested that esns local counsel called the edtx court clerk and convinced him her to change the docket to reflect an october 16 filing date rather than the october 15 filing date i checked and sure enough thats exactly what happened the docket was altered to reflect an october 16 filing date and the complaint was altered to change the filing date stamp from october 15 to october 16 only the edtx court clerk could have made such changes this is yet another example of the abusive nature of litigating patent cases in the banana republic of east texas
5102494 in my opinion albritton is a big fat liar for filing a patent lawsuit before the patent was issued
5102495 here we hold that at least where a newspaper publishes speech of public concern a private figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without also showing that the statements at issue are false
5102496 you take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and ill show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
5102497 you cant afford to question my activities regardless of the fact that you have every right to question my activities and besides you questioned my activities anonymously and thats bad because i am a sensitive litigious jerk
5102498 one email suggested that esns local counsel called the edtx court clerk and convinced him her to change the docket to reflect an october 16 filing date rather than the october 15 filing date i checked and sure enough thats exactly what happened

5102517 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5102518 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
5102519 were talking about more than just copyright here were talking about the digital environment
5102520 this legislation represents a real threat to the vibrancy of that online environment
5102521 the activity online proves that a broad range of stakeholders with varying interests and vantage points care deeply about this issue
5102522 there are so many canadians who have issues will this bill
5102523 and the online forum has helped us get informed which leads to offline rallies after we meet members write about what we learned post videos back on to the blogs and facebook
5102524 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
5102525 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
5102526 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
5102527 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
5102528 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
5102529 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
5102530 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
5102531 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
5102532 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
5102533 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
5102534 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
5102535 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
5102536 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
5102537 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
5102538 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
5102539 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
5102540 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
5102541 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part

5102545 it was subsequently revealed that the bryce committee did not personally interview a single witness relying instead on hearsay evidence and depositions given without oaths a belgian commission of enquiry in 1922 failed to corroborate a single major allegation in the bryce report
5102546 god will save her fear you not be you the men youve been
5102547 there would have been no war propaganda without the war no atrocity stories without atrocities although the entente press wildly exagerrated what went on in belgium there is no question that the german army did commit atrocities there in 1914 according to evidence from the diaries of german soldiers and other reliable sources all the advancing german armies executed civilians including women and priests altogether about 5 500 belgian civilians were deliberately killed by the german army most of them in the eleven day period from 18 14th august 1914 and at least another 500 in france the germans also used civilians as human shields and razed numerous villages to the ground in one case an eighteen year old girl was bayonnetted to death there were also numerous rapes in occupied france
5102548 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
5102549 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

5102569 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5102570 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5102571 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5102572 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5102573 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally

5102588 our hope with food is that if you continue to give them a daily dose over a longer period of time that it might desensitize them
5102589 but if you could give something orally that would be better
5102590 but i think were going to have viable treatments in the not too distant future

5102623 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

5102664 the fact is we have been hearing about supplementary budget for a very long time now and it is not coming so what we know about now is the 2009 appropriation bill which we can demand legitimately because for whatever reason it is the executive that determines whether they want to bring a supplementary budget for one or two issues but its taken forever we can demand for the 2009 budget which is very statutory because there is no way they are not going to bring the budget but we are asking that they should bring it on time so that we can do all the work we have to do on it

5102693 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5102694 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5102710 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5102711 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5102712 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5102713 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5102714 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells

5102797 but the smooth material apparently spewed out by the geyser makes a very attractive target for future spacecraft observations

5102799 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5102800 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5102801 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5102802 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system
5102803 we were happy to see a decrease in 2006 on 2005 but this has turned around again the majority of cheques are still business to business
5102804 so far this month there has been 16 centimetres of rain four times the monthly average and we are only halfway through the month
5102805 indications are that we will have the worst month of all time certainly in the east we are seeing one of the most dismal summers of recent times a wet summer that has got into a rut since july
5102806 we have had a short term view of where we put housing in terms of risk in the past one hopes this is a lesson for the design standards which will come out from the department of the environment hopefully later this year
5102807 the indications are there will be an emphasis on protecting housing structures rather than avoiding flood risk areas

5102813 we have discovered only in the last 48 hours that a number of retailers have been affected by a point of sale compromise
5102814 we are in the lucky position that it was discovered quickly and the garda are working on it
5102815 garda have uncovered a lot of the devices and cctv footage we have a list of all the card numbers that have been used they have either been blocked or restrictions put on those cards
5102816 with the devices recovered it may just be that the cards were only saved and the criminals did not have a chance to get hold of the card numbers
5102817 there will be an emergency meeting today with the garda the terminal vendors and the banks to try and close down on this
5102818 the criminals have been going into shops claiming to be engineers working on the terminals staff are used to their bank officials coming to update terminals so unfortunately they have been able to do that
5102819 we have been working with a number of the larger chain stores to make sure that does not happen
5102820 unfortunately a lot of people were unavailable over the weekend so i would expect by lunchtime today anyone who might be affected would know about it and put preventative measures in place

5102825 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5102826 we are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behaviour from this point forward

5102974 siamo delusi da questo risultato perch pensavamo di poter fare un altro tipo di gara invece il cittadella ha giocato a viso aperto questo deve farci capire che il prossimo sar un campionato molto difficile da affrontare credo che sconfitte di questo tipo siano utili per farci stare con i piedi per terra facendoci togliere subito dalla testa ambizioni di promozioni
5102975 per adesso siamo ancora in rodaggio e loro si sono dimostrati molto pi brillanti di noi anche perch abbiamo terminato da poco il ritiro e siamo ancora un p imballati
5102976 sono contento perch siamo venuti a pisa a giocarci la partita e abbiamo dimostrato grande voglia di portare a casa questo risultato rossi sta lavorando molto bene e spero possa sostituire al meglio coralli
5102977 pensavamo di soffrire di pi con lancona tanto che nella rifinitura in mattinata ci eravamo anche allenati sui calci di rigore vincere cos la dimostrazione che il gruppo c mi dispiace solo per il palo di coralli avrebbe potuto fare un eurogol lacquisto di corvia porta qualit e ben si inserisce nel nostro schema che prevede fantasia alle sue spalle con lodi e vannucchi questo empoli crescer perch un gruppo serio lobiettivo questanno inutile nascondersi lottare per tornare in serie a voglio riprendere la favola da dove lho lasciata lultima volta che sono stato a empoli
5102978 ho colto loccasione a due passi dalla porta unoccasione che non potevo lasciarmi sfuggire sullangolo mi sono inserito e quando ho visto quella palla vagante non mi restava che metterla in rete ho visto un buon empoli stasera una bella squadra con il mio inserimento che procede a piccoli passi questo gol comunque non mi basta e cercher di migliorare il pi possibile in questa stagione la dedica a questa rete va alle persone che mi stanno sempre vicine soprattutto la mia famiglia e la mia ragazza
5102979 abbiamo interpretato bene la gara imponendo fin da subito i nostri ritmi dispiace per il rigore fallito ho sbagliato io a calciarlo e comunque questo non mi impedir di tornare sul dischetto la prossima volta che ci sar bisogno visto che sono il rigorista dopo le ultime amichevoli siamo cresciuti in condizioni e con coralli e vannucchi mi trovo molto bene ed il feeling aumenta partita dopo partita sono daccordo con il mister sugli obiettivi stagionali dopo alcuni anni passati a frosinone a lottare per la salvezza sono consapevole che dovremo lottare per la promozione

5102996 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5102997 you can make these up to one week in advance
5102998 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5102999 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

5103006 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5103007 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5103008 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5103009 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5103010 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5103011 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5103012 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5103013 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5103014 if i had just heard from the proponents i would probably vote for it myself
5103015 law enforcement agencies shall not allocate any resources for the investigation and prosecution of prostitutes for prostitution
5103016 no way does this dance look dated or old fashioned and i do my bit by stripping away anything that reminds you of the past such as poodle skirts or slicked back hair no show illustrates the cardinal rule of the musical as well as if you cant say it you sing it and if you cant sing it you dance it thats the dynamic and thats the greatness of it

5103020 the boys are too kempt they dope not neither do they drink this makes them unreal and gives the show an air of sociological slumming
5103021 the thing that have in common is that they were all wild once
5103022 these people love their horses they spend all year training and working with them to compete
5103023 this is the same place a mother horse nuzzles her foal and tells her its ok

5103025 there is an inescapable conclusion that allegations of breaches were founded and penalties imposed appropriately

5103034 i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
5103035 vladimir putins invoking bushs iraq adventure points directly to the way in which bush has enabled other world powers to act impulsively

5103038 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilized
5103039 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
5103040 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5103041 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5103042 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5103043 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
5103044 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
5103045 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
5103046 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
5103047 our understanding is that the agreement has been signed and russian troops are starting to withdraw but there are a lot of units scattered around this area
5103048 my understanding is that the process will take some time
5103049 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
5103050 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakable
5103051 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
5103052 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realize their wishes and dreams
5103053 i promise you we will rebuild your houses our villages will be the best in the world
5103054 in general the situation is under the control of our forces
5103055 i think they all sides reuters tension remained high in georgia on thursday with russian troops and armor moving around three towns inside the country and ignoring demands by washington that moscow respect its territorial integrity
5103056 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
5103057 the russian role in georgia has massive implications for the russian role in ukraine and the baltic republics not surprisingly they are taking an increasingly strong line on this because they see this as a defining moment for their relationship with russia
5103058 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than in the middle or at the end of it
5103059 if this thing escalates we could possibly see differential relations within nato we are at one of those crossroads
5103060 they will not want to threaten that on the other hand the u s is taking a tougher line and so we could be heading not just for an increasing showdown with the u s and russia which could get very nervy but we could also be leading to some very difficult discussions going on in backrooms between european countries and the americans
5103061 i think they all sides will know where to draw a line to prevent further escalation
5103062 clearly it could do escalate if there are flashpoints if for example there is a standoff between ukrainian and russian naval forces or if u s forces are impeded obstructed or fired upon while under taking humanitarian work those are areas where there could potentially be a flashpoint
5103063 its in nobodys interest for this to escalate to a regional conflict
5103064 what happened in georgia could directly impact on ukraine if for example the political divisions in ukraine solidify and become violent in any way what this could do is set a template for russian intervention in a sovereign state
5103065 a conflict is in neither russia nor ukraines interest trade between the two has been rising at 30 percent a year the price moves today are understandable but not really justified
5103066 unfortunately the gas deal with the russians has not yet been signed and this could make it more difficult a sudden adjustment to market prices for gas next year would be hard for the economy to absorb
5103067 on a five year outlook you can be very bullish on ukraine and it will become more integrated with the european union especially as the free trade area negotiations will europeanize the whole of business on a one year horizon it is going to be tougher
5103068 a significant uptick in fighting is on balance unlikely given president medvedevs 12 august statement that hostilities are almost complete and the 13 august informal ceasefire
5103069 the chance of an incident is very low as the risk to both sides is obviously extremely high
5103070 the informal ceasefire u s russian interactions and moscows intentions all create risk the georgian russian war has already changed eurasias political and economic landscape
5103071 moscow henceforth will be very hard for the us to work with on iran or other key issues
5103072 the current crisis shows russia has gained self confidence that it is no longer willing to play the part of the inferior partner one which the united states does not have to take into account
5103073 that showed with kosovo where the russian objections were not taken into consideration at all the same applies to georgias possible nato entry which russia fiercely opposes
5103074 russia basically says you have recognized kosovo we shall recognize south ossetia and abkhazia
5103075 the perspective of georgia entering nato is weak now since the russian forces have practically destroyed the georgian army russian tanks are driving back and forth through georgia at will
5103076 its a perfect storm for ukraine at the moment the government has made it clear that it is on a collision course with russia and there are other issues as well
5103077 the idea that you get one of these flare ups in tensions that involve military conflict that would then just die down overnight was somewhat misplaced
5103078 all you can really say is that well have kind of focus on the more medium term issues and try to see through this bout of political risk
5103079 its certainly true that the longer this goes on the bigger hit russias image is going to take in the west
5103080 but at the same time there is a change of administration in washington at the end of the year and there has been a change in moscow although putins prime minister whether you like it or not we do have a more dovish president in place now whether hes pulling the strings or not
5103081 at 12 20 0820 gmt this afternoon russian forces blew up a major railroad bridge near gori
5103082 that bridge being gone effectively results in the country losing east west railway communications
5103083 we are in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
5103084 we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
5103085 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
5103086 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
5103087 ive made very clear that we were going to sign that agreement as soon as poland and the united states had come to terms and weve now come to terms
5103088 this is helping them identify capabilities this is largely polish funding of their modernization efforts
5103089 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
5103090 from my point of view the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5103091 i have to assume for now that the word of the president of russia to the presidency of the
5103092 reiterated united states support for the government and people of georgia
5103093 but these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5103094 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
5103095 i think that russia will care about this talk because it is not just talk it is about russias standing in the international community
5103096 we stand by georgia our friend and ally and call on the ioc to designate a new venue for the russian olympics
5103097 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5103098 sochi a mere 20 miles from the current conflict zone makes it a practically unacceptable location for the olympics
5103099 enhanced interrogation techniques if you prefer against these detainees the seemingly limitless detention faced by some held at gitmo and the creation of media driven spectacles to drive crowds to cheer for war war and more war
5103100 on my late night drive back from st pete to him i shivered as i thought to myself how cold he and chase must have been at midnight in colorado all the while i was driving with my windows open feeling the 77 degree temps here
5103101 these are combining to create a kind of a perfect storm that we have going on right now
5103102 you see it in rising food prices rising energy prices and a great land grab to produce biofuels the easiest way to grow these crops is to grab lands in the tropics from rainforests
5103103 meanwhile the developing world sees climate change as a train crashing through their countries but something that is not their fault
5103104 forests fall because they are worth more cut down than standing this is a classic example of a market failure
5103105 philanthropy and taxes by governments arent going to be enough to fund forest conservation efforts on the kind of scale thats going to be needed to have a real impact
5103106 but for a market 10 15 billion is quite manageable thats about what we drink in wine and champagne every year in britain for a fraction of the percent of the three trillion dollar a year insurance business we could save forests
5103107 the central issue in this whole debate is how we put a true value on standing rainforest to the world community
5103108 the indigenous communities probably have the best track record of any group in looking after their forests and preventing deforestation
5103109 the problem that we face is that under the redd mechanism being developed by the un there is a danger that these groups wont see compensation because they have a low deforestation baseline and are therefore not emitting
5103110 we need to think about how these communities who have succeeded in protecting their forests should get paid as i see it a method for this is the ecosystem services they are providing the world
5103111 the world is waking up to this and will drive capital to the canopy
5103112 how much money would you be prepared to pay governor braga of amazonas to keep the rain coming
5103113 a primary driver of deforestation is agribusiness in the amazon
5103114 why did this investment happen the very first in the world in iwokrama
5103115 okay so you are going to pay people for ecosystem services now that is just paying people to do nothing so youre going to pay them not to cut down their trees what are they going to do sleep in hammocks and drink beer
5103116 we dont need too much we are happy for our capital to be employed and will take a small return
5103117 well that means all the money will go to aaa
5103118 the market is not perfect there is going to be good guys and bad guys
5103119 im not buying bad palm oil any more im only going to take good palm oil

5103132 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5103133 not aware of any attempts to fix prices in line with profits or individuals earnings
5103134 prof rawlins does not seem to have taken into account the huge contribution the pharmaceuticals industry makes to public healthcare and the fact that it is always looking for ways to reduce the prices of the drugs it sells he also does not seem to have taken into account the massive investment into research and development this averages 550m for what is often a 10 to 12 year process drug prices reflect this investment

5103136 sellers coming to the market in the middle of the summer holiday season tend to be more motivated london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale with more than 21 000 off in a month
5103137 the number of transactions this year is in danger of being the lowest since 1959
5103138 in what has been a turbulent period for retailers this sale represents the best possible outcome for creditors and is a tremendous result for the business its staff customers and suppliers
5103139 the purchasers have a history in the retail flooring sector and a passion for this business
5103140 the board confirms that it did receive an indicative proposal and that it has been rejected
5103141 the offer undervalued the retail assets the cashflow and the potential profits of the business
5103142 involved a complex restructuring which in practical terms is not achievable
5103143 its a similar business to alliance amp leicester insofar as its an ex building society and he didnt really take a amp l anywhere i dont see whats in it for shareholders other than he knows how to stop one of these things from going bust
5103144 there are two ways that falling land values affect housebuilders the first is in pushing down share prices but the more worrying issue is for those that are heavily indebted and are under pressure from their banks to repay debt
5103145 at the moment you have to sell development land at fire sale prices
5103146 there are people with funds that are getting ready to invest you can start bottom fishing in the current market this is the point in the market where development fortunes are lost but also made
5103147 the group is interested in acquiring assets that will add value for our shareholders we have a strong track record when it comes to running airports we have a lot of skilled people who have developed very good relationships with airlines and other partners
5103148 wed be in like a bandit baa knows were interested
5103149 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5103150 but i think some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time
5103151 if it did not represent such a loss of shareholder value it would be a comedy
5103152 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5103153 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate the uk urgently needs an interest rate cut
5103154 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut in line with our central forecast but if the mpc decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse than in our central scenario
5103155 british businesses are already being squeezed by the rising cost of raw materials and weakening export prospects in the slowing european market despite a weaker pound
5103156 these pressures together with the bleak outlook for domestic growth are taking an inevitable toll on firms confidence in their own ability to do business
5103157 theres a strong relationship between business confidence and the actual performance of the economy and with so many firms remaining downbeat we can expect uk economic growth to remain weak well into next year
5103158 take determined measures to strengthen the uks medium term budgetary position
5103159 it must also establish a more credible fiscal framework which is supervised by independent experts
5103160 hes there to keep it chugging along stop it going off the rails and hopefully sell it to the spanish or anybody else who comes knocking
5103161 i didnt know anything about insurance i certainly didnt know anything about london and i didnt know if my act would fly in london to be honest with you
5103162 look i think we got a perfect storm here thats what makes it more fun you couldnt do a deal like this if the climate was great right
5103163 then id have to pay 90 a share or something for hr amp h
5103164 if i were british or scandinavian i would still have done the hr amp h deal it has nothing to do with americanisation i dont think that willis has become more and more american i am a little more effervescent than my predecessor was or my predecessors thats true thats not because of my americanism its because of my style
5103165 im making a big deal out of it because london i believe is becoming if it hasnt already become a global financial centre of the world
5103166 i dont think its necessarily a slap on the strategy i think its a slap on the execution
5103167 look at the people who have come out of citigroup
5103168 eight nine years ago that place was buzzing the problem isnt citigroups structure as it is maybe the people playing
5103169 i like to get away with as little sleep as possible given that i can do more when im not sleeping and that ill be asleep for quite some time
5103170 when i leave here people will say this is a much better company than when he got here and if i can do that thats all you can really hope for and what id love people to say is that guy made me do things i never thought i could do thats really a test of leadership
5103171 market conditions were difficult throughout the period with funds raised on aim down 75pc on the first half of 2007
5103172 this shows that the market is virtually closed for new issues other than exceptional propositions and even then valuations will be challenged
5103173 even in challenging market conditions aim continues to perform strongly
5103174 over half of all the new companies admitted to the market this year are currently trading above their issue price among the companies performing well are businesses operating in india the middle east china japan and america highlighting how aim is continuing to attract ambitious companies from across the world
5103175 sunkar resources floated in june and it has already lost almost two thirds of its money
5103176 we are seeing hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds behind these companies anecdotally it looks like there are more non traditional funds they are not gartmore new star asset management or fidelity type funds nor are they pension funds
5103177 this has been a year during which the equity markets have all but dried up for anything but top quality mining companies
5103178 as such there have been no aim mining ipos worth mentioning during the year to date on the back of the credit crunch the debt and equity markets squeeze and growing nervousness about the sustainability of the commodities bull market investors in the mining sectors have been reducing exposure to the sector
5103179 essentially whether in an ipo or a secondary capital raising investors are looking for similar things such as cashflow generating assets a solid growth story liquidity well defined use of proceeds and a strong experienced management team
5103180 we have observed that investors attitudes over recent months have hardened although we believe that for resources companies in particular it is possible to garner support for those with well defined growth plans or those with near term or current revenue generation
5103181 here in south la we have a plethora of liquor stores and fast food restaurants but whats frustrating is that the need is there for fresh produce and yet we havent been able to get our own domestic grocery chains into the area
5103182 it will be very interesting to see if people will gravitate towards it
5103183 when tesco first came to america we were pleasantly surprised they were saying they wanted to do things differently
5103184 but today almost a year later weve found theyre a lot like others in the industry opening stores in the exact same locations neglecting others
5103185 revitalisation with condos and lofts and a bunch of high end developments
5103186 they didnt show up in the heart of south central
5103187 we want them to engage in the community and talk to us
5103188 we have developed a very competitive pay and benefits package for all of our employees
5103189 the problem is that around here with all the competition im just not sure if its going to take off
5103190 the whole decoupling thesis has started to come apart at the seams
5103191 canada is frozen over we have arctic conditions in sweden and the uk is falling off the white cliffs of dover
5103192 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50pc from the peak and at that lower level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
5103193 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial
5103194 i do not think we are near the end of writedowns i continue to see capital levels going lower and stocks going lower
5103195 my mother told me about a sewing pattern popular in the 1970s that used towels to make kids bathrobes
5103196 and all this crazy talk about never using shampoo ever we use shampoo to clean our scalp its not even technically about the hair itself
5103197 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident i e bullying
5103198 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5103199 we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5103200 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5103201 per me certe persone hanno troppa paura per pensare che le cose possono essere diverse insomma il mondo non tutto quanto merda ma credo che sia difficile per certa gente che abituata alle cose cos come sono anche se sono brutte
5103202 there are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for help and we dont have the wherewithal to deal with the situation
5103203 we will establish the writ of the government at all costs as a parallel government cannot be tolerated
5103204 politicians always seem to be able to find money for self promotion and pet projects unfortunately our public schools continue to suffer from poor planning inappropriate priorities and a failure to concentrate resources in programs to reduce the states shameful dropout rate the news this week further illustrates an out of touch self centered and entrenched democrat leadership in north carolina just add this to the john edwards poverty center the job and pay increase for the states first lady and questionable foreign trips by the governor and his wife it is past time for democrats to fund the states real priorities of education transportation and public safety and leave political promotion and pet projects behind
5103205 if you ever need a stranger to sing at your wedding
5103206 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5103207 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5103208 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5103209 parents are finding their childrens overseas study bear increasingly heavy financial burdens due to the weakening won against the canadian dollar last year and against the u s dollar in the first half of this year amid the worsening economic environment some students are returning home early before finishing their study programs
5103210 it seems parents are less inclined to school their children overseas hoping the domestic english education system to be galvanized theyve realized its difficult to care for their children if they re overseas
5103211 every year a large number of poor people caste hindus buddhist muslims and tribal people convert to christianity through financial support
5103212 poverty and economic problems are the main causes of conversion to christianity
5103213 christian missionaries and ngos are working to convert people in the name of social service and development works
5103214 i have no information about increasing christian population in bangladesh
5103215 because there is no department in the ministry of religious affairs to look into how many people convert into christian
5103216 we get all sorts of support from the government we are minority but have influence power to the society
5103217 converting into christianity through financial support is not acceptable to humanity
5103218 we are trying to find out this sort of immoral conversion into christianity

5103227 complex inter ethnic issues should be solved through peaceful means through negotiations there is no military solution to these issues
5103228 unfortunately due to actions by some cis states our community has become weak and has no levers to intervene in such conflicts
5103229 it has been noted that attempts to solve existing problems through military means are fraught with tragic consequences
5103230 we support the territorial integrity of georgia and support efforts to avoid the escalation of violence in the region and restore peace
5103231 everyone in moscow thought we are in the right and the enemy will be destroyed but in minsk and other cis capitals everyone was in disarray

5103233 i dont believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also dont believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia
5103234 the starting point of the military confrontation was georgias march into south ossetia we shouldnt confuse things
5103235 in my view we have seen major mistakes by the west in its policy towards russia

5103240 the situation in the conflict zone is quite difficult at the moment isolated diversionary groups and snipers continue to operate on the territory of south ossetia
5103241 during the course of a roadside check by russian forces shots were exchanged and a car put out of action was found to contain 19 rocket launchers
5103242 specialists believe this group intended to carry out a diversionary act in the roki tunnel to block the movements of all vehicles taking part in humanitarian operations
5103243 in general the situation is under the control of our forces which are shifting their focus from military matters to the transition to fulfilling humanitarian tasks
5103244 work is proceeding on restoring water supplies in tskhinvali and we hope to restore power in a week
5103245 there are no iskander missiles in the north caucasus military district the iskander is a specific type of weapon used for specific tasks and as for the tasks facing the peacekeeping forces traditional types of weaponry were sufficient to fulfill those tasks they were therefore clearly not used and there are no plans to bring them in
5103246 this will be discussed in political terms and clearly some sort of formula will be chosen as for the use of peacekeeping contingents from other structures we will have to wait for a political decision at the same time our head of state was clear in saying that after what has happened neither the abakhazians nor the ossetians will accept a georgian component the russian side naturally will abide by this and supports it fully
5103247 some people describe looters as the piranhas of war others the jackals of war it is local authorities that must act on this our task in tskhinvali is to detain them and turn them over to local authorities to investigate and bring them to justice
5103248 no one has taken away our task of peacekeeping in south ossetia and abkhazia and if russians stop performing this task who then will establish order
5103249 the georgian side delayed signature of the six principles they objected to the sixth point the russian and french presidents signed immediately during their meeting in russia and we were waiting for a decision by the georgian side and the draft in that form has at last been signed
5103250 it seems to me that the united states has to have a darned good reason to break off relations with russia and go back to the dark days of the cold war
5103251 i dont believe events thus far provide that reason both sides need the other too much
5103252 we have never profited much by not talking to people with whom we dont have common ground
5103253 i have never believed we are very effective at trying to play the game of reward and punishment with a nation as big as russia
5103254 the missile defense deal with poland certainly raises the ante and i believe that the timing is anything but accidental
5103255 we should not take our eye off the immediate issue which is for the first time since the end of the soviet union russian troops have invaded and are occupying another country
5103256 but isolating russia is not really an option it will not be isolated it is too big it is too powerful
5103257 if for some reason or another the russians proceed with their occupation go to tbilisi and topple saakashvili then we are probably in a world where russia finds itself outside the community of nations and some type of militarized rivalry is likely to return

5103286 finally i get to set the record straight everyone in the world has spoken about this and can speak about me can write about me except for me so finally i have a voice
5103287 when i was outed on july 14th 2003 i was until that moment covert
5103288 that means no one outside of a very small circle knew where i really worked
5103289 we understood that he would be criticized deeply i never once considered that in fact this administration would betray my identity as payback for his criticism
5103290 our mission was to make sure that the bad guys basically did not get nuclear weapons
5103291 its not as though saddam hussein had not pursued this and had not used wmd on his own people
5103292 you and your team were meeting with iraqi scientists before the invasion what kind of intelligence were you getting from those people
5103293 could it be you just werent getting enough intelligence at the time
5103294 exactly that was the horror you didnt know if maybe if you just found the right scientist if you just got to the right person he would be able to give you the plans or give you you know really critical stuff that would help put all these pieces together
5103295 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5103296 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5103297 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5103298 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5103299 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5103300 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5103301 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures
5103302 not crowded with other people new zealand press agency nzpa reported
5103303 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
5103304 i think its very clear that islamic ambitions are to restore the old caliphate
5103305 yes we have but nothing is confirmed keep posted in the next couple of weeks for the announcement
5103306 e la prima volta che camilleri pubblica un suo lavoro su internet spiega il direttore di agrigentonotizie it michele scim e siamo davvero onorati del fatto che il debutto sul web avvenga con il nostro giornale un quotidiano della sua terra e stata unemozione forte quando proprio lo scrittore ci ha confermato personalmente che molto volentieri ci concedeva di pubblicare questo suo racconto colgo loccasione anche per ringraziare il sindaco di porto empedocle lillo firetto grazie al quale abbiamo potuto intraprendere un rapporto privilegiato con lo scrittore empedoclino e andrea camilleri si dimostrato ancora una volta persona di rara affettuosit e generosit regalandoci senza esitare un attimo una delle sue perle

5103312 its not that one student coming to move in its a family affair
5103313 they have a nice sized room so they dont seem to be too worried about it
5103314 its much like what kindergarten teachers tell us when we drop our kids off
5103315 we are about much more than just keeping in touch we are about making people more productive in their business network
5103316 imagine you had all the students at oxford trying to access the web through a single uk household connection
5103317 for the first time people in the region will have an on ramp on to the global internet highway
5103318 for a country to be without fibre optic links today is like being without a harbour in the past you are landlocked

5103332 there could be no more appropriate recognition of chris hoys superb achievements at the beijing olympics than a knighthood
5103333 chris has been such an inspiration and a knighthood would be fitting recognition for his hard work and leadership that saw him win both an individual gold and another in the team sprint in beijing over the last couple of days
5103334 chris hoys achievement will inspire more people to come forward at the 2012 olympics in london and the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow
5103335 im sure everyone in scotland will have their fingers crossed for hoy in his final event
5103336 its been an eventful day and so many things happen you just try and block it all out and focus on your ride and focus on your performance and thats what i did
5103337 to finish with one two on the podium thats just unbelievable
5103338 this has been the most successful weekend ever for scottish olympians and they are doing themselves and the country extremely proud
5103339 it is clearly significant that he has chosen to register this halfway through the investigation it is a welcome move
5103340 a careful respected lawyer with a fine record in prosecuting inhumane argentinian generals
5103341 we are concerned about the phenomena of burn out among experienced investigators who have left the office since 2005
5103342 there are simply not enough to handle the rigorous demands of these investigations and there is the perception that their efforts are not sufficiently valued
5103343 i have a strong case that is why i am appealing the judgment
5103344 i came out of the press conference in a state of shock
5103345 he painted a picture no scholar would recognise he was basically calling for regime change making a political statement which is surprising coming from the chief prosecutor of the icc
5103346 by presenting his case in such stark terms the prosecutor has made it easy for his critics to dismiss him as ill informed and driven by a desire for publicity and has made it harder for the advocates of justice in darfur to pursue the challenge of calling to account those responsible for crimes no less heinous than genocide
5103347 no one knows what my evidence is let the judges decide
5103348 i am an author and am totally against plagiarism but the use of personalities which are already in existence is common

5103350 we have been advised that one of our aircraft has been involved in an accident and we believe it resulted in fatalities the information we have is that we believe our aircraft was performing a normal approach to coventry airport for landing the collision took place around one minute from touchdown
5103351 they were all our employees that we have known in some cases for many years its a very difficult situation for all of us this is the first serious accident that the group has been involved in for over 20 years we are all extremely shocked at the unexpected tragedy
5103352 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5103353 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5103354 unfortunately when the emergency services got to the casualties nothing could be done for them
5103355 we have placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5103356 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological position or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5103357 as president i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5103358 i think barack obama is very likeable and emotional but he skirted the issues the evening definitely cemented my views
5103359 barack obama was just like a regular politician he didnt answer the questions
5103360 if it exists should we negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5103361 defeat it if i am president of the united states my friends i will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell and i will get him
5103362 weve got to drill now and weve got to drill here
5103363 if youve got book sales of 25m then you qualify
5103364 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family then you are middle class or youre poor if youre making more than 250 000 youre doing well
5103365 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5103366 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5103367 if youre just talking about income how about 5m it doesnt matter because i dont want to raise anyones taxes
5103368 it was just pastor rick and his wife she played the piano and he was the preacher now there are three main preachers in my household we call them the teacher the comic and the marketeer pastor rick is the marketing pastor he knows how to sell himself and the church and religion i dont know if he knows that thats what hes doing
5103369 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5103370 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5103371 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5103372 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5103373 begin the withdrawal of the military contingent moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5103374 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5103375 the conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees floral shorts and photo ops
5103376 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5103377 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5103378 he has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises from tax cuts to more prisons to solving family breakdown without getting drawn on delivery but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get promises made to different audiences dont stack up he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in the london mayoral election whilst promising the city to do more on infrastructure
5103379 cameron is promising lower taxes more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time
5103380 he pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage inheritance tax and stamp duty savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5103381 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy
5103382 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5103383 hardly anyone disputes the contention that the modern public school is seriously flawed
5103384 el momento hist rico exige entendimiento y seg n avancen los acontecimientos ya veremos

5103388 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5103389 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5103390 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5103391 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5103392 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5103393 a gm executive was required to watch each of the dream cars get cut into pieces and crushed
5103394 the gm exec took the lasalle roadster and biscayne to the junkyard and he figured the guys at the junkyard would finish the job properly so he took off early to go christmas shopping the junkyard workers never crushed the lasalle instead leaving it in many pieces
5103395 i had to dig pieces out of the ground the body of the car was fiberglass so it didnt oxidize but other remaining parts were almost hopeless the body had to be glued back together from all the bits and pieces it was like resurrecting a dinosaur
5103396 ive been doing this since 78 being a treasure hunter and restoring concept cars these cars are a treat for the eyes and a study in history and im excited to bring several of these gems to pebble beach
5103397 these and other historical treasures from motorama demonstrate the forward thinking that led gm to the front of the pack
5103398 joe bortz has somehow managed to rescue and resurrect concept cars from that era allowing us to see the sometimes radical gm designs that influenced industry styling for decades
5103399 these motorama cars fit perfectly with pebble beachs history of showing only the rarest vehicles and they allow us to emphasize the importance of preserving our automotive history
5103400 one of the most desirable and beautiful concept cars of all time
5103401 it was called the miracle car inside general motors because it drew the largest crowds of any of the concepts shown in motorama
5103402 pebble beach will be the first time the biscayne will be shown publicly since 1955 since the windows werent flat we had to create a wraparound windshield and the door mechanisms are made with the help of swiss clockmakers its not fully restored its still a work in progress

5103404 i talked about that at spring training i thought he was going to have a good year
5103405 hes just thrown the ball great and hes been really consistent every start he goes out there he locates he changes speeds and hes just in a groove
5103406 i was hoping that id be important to the club this year
5103407 i was hoping id have a role like ive had in the past coming off of last year and the way things were setting up in spring training youre not really sure the way its going to be
5103408 it still looked like they were comfortable at the plate
5103409 and when theyre standing in there comfortably thats something you dont want to see
5103410 he has a sense of how to read swings and i think he knows his mechanics really well if somethings off a little bit i think moose because hes thrown so many games can correct it on the fly
5103411 im just pleased ive been able to go out there every time its my turn and pitch well and winning games is a bonus

5103482 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5103483 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5103484 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident i e bullying
5103485 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5103486 we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5103487 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5103488 we must not wish for happiness for it is not something we deserve when life goes well its an unsuspected gift so cherish it while it last
5103489 the first time i met her was in the bar on 5 th ave she came in with a man and at that point i knew she would be mine the problem was i could tell that she loved him so i decided to let her alone till i saw him leave her at the bar and go away with another woman that angered me so much i wanted him dead
5103490 baby that was my brother dropping me off at the bar and that was his wife he left with later that evening they were ran off the road and brutally murdered my brother you catch your breathe was knocked out and tied up so he could watch my sister in law get raped and then her throat was cut and ten my brother was castrated and shot in the head how could you say something so awful
5103491 did they catch the killer i bet he used an exacto knife to finish her
5103492 i knew her briefly i actually met the two of you at that little place on i tried to buy you a drink and you declined and she laughed at me i watched you all night but every time i got near you your sister would pull me away it was like she grabbed every limb of your body to keep me away this is why she had a closed casket that bitch she tried so hard to keep us apart she got what she deserve and they will never find
5103493 you guys you guys it is not what you think honey i can see what you are thinking it is not like that i didnt know back then you didnt drink i just thought you didnt want my drink you know how some women are i saw you with a drink any way
5103494 i have been dry for 7yrs now i havent drank any alcohol since i lost my baby in a car wreck that was cranberry juice
5103495 ive lived here my whole life but could you please give me some directions
5103496 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
5103497 ive never used cocaine i wouldnt know what it looks like
5103498 o ouvido precisa de cera assim quanto o nariz de meleca
5103499 obviously were very sad by the deaths mr thew said
5103500 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5103501 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5103502 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5103503 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5103504 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5103505 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5103506 im more at a loss for words than i was yesterday
5103507 the help from these guys made it all possible its amazing to be part of this
5103508 weve all heard of the spitzian feat its a new one now
5103509 the one hundredth of a second last night to finishing off with the world record its the whole thing its a great experience for me and something ill have forever
5103510 its something that you always want to do and dream of doing and you think you can do
5103511 but i guess its never really real until you actually do it the biggest thing ive been thankful for is ive been able to use my imagination when people said its impossible it cant be done thats where my imagination came into play
5103512 the guy who probably has more of a problem with it is michael michael cant be michael michaels middle name is mark spitz basically
5103513 im not sure when it might be once in a century you see something like this
5103514 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5103515 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5103516 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5103517 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5103518 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5103519 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5103520 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5103521 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5103522 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5103523 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5103524 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5103525 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5103526 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5103527 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5103528 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5103529 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5103530 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5103531 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5103532 it was a grind mentally and physically to bear down and make pitches
5103533 the position were in winning series is what were shooting for
5103534 everybody goes through it well go out on the road and try to turn this thing around
5103535 through three at bats i didnt feel too good but i got a hit at the most important part of the game
5103536 if i make the play its a great play if not like today im sure somebody is going to call and say you should have stayed back thats baseball
5103537 those are guys that can swing the bat and hit the ball out of the park so you never know you want to keep tacking on runs when you play a team like that
5103538 the american public knows that the congressional bans on drilling are artificially inflating their gasoline prices and shipping tanker loads of american wealth to unsavory regimes around the world
5103539 the united states energy system has been built over more than 100 years and cannot be replaced overnight no matter how much some washington politicians want to wish away petroleum based fossil fuels the reality is that there is no feasible near term alternative
5103540 expanded domestic exploration and drilling are essential to lowering gasoline prices america has plentiful oil resources now off limits and tapping those will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our national security
5103541 repealing the congressional drilling bans can quickly reduce gasoline prices as the market anticipates greater american supply in the near future hopefully the public will drill drill drill that point home to their congressmen during the five weeks that theyre back in their districts while this crisis festers
5103542 the legislature cannot judge the success of the shift to file and use rate regulation because the system has not been fully implemented
5103543 likely to produce a long term profit that is unreasonably high in relation to the insurance coverage provided
5103544 we live in a world that moves faster than at any time in history
5103545 knowledge and capital are rapidly being deployed to parts of the world where the right combination of talent technology business climate infrastructure and markets converge i believe texas is that place now more than ever
5103546 there is simply no better place to live work grow a business and raise a family than the great state of texas
5103547 we have the best business climate in the country and remain globally competitive thanks to our reasonable regulations low taxes fair legal environment educated workforce and an unparalleled quality of life
5103548 this decrease in total traffic fatalities demonstrates that the major investments we have made in transportation safety are producing real and significant results for our citizens every life saved on our highways represents a real tragedy that texas families have not had to endure this is a major step forward
5103549 making sure the public has the safest transportation system possible is at the center of everything we do
5103550 it is extremely gratifying to see these positive results in part from our implementation of the safety bond program the ability to issue these bonds has allowed us to target high risk locations and get projects on the ground faster
5103551 it is extremely encouraging to see the overall number of traffic fatalities decrease especially considering how fast our states population is increasing
5103552 we have more drivers and vehicles than at any other time in our history
5103553 a congestion pricing plan is the most cost effective way to jump start transit improvements and reduce traffic congestion
5103554 its important that the worlds oldest democracy must stand with one of the newest when its been illegally invaded by another country

5103567 we have been advised that one of our aircraft has been involved in an accident and we believe it resulted in fatalities the information we have is that we believe our aircraft was performing a normal approach to coventry airport for landing the collision took place around one minute from touchdown
5103568 they were all our employees that we have known in some cases for many years its a very difficult situation for all of us this is the first serious accident that the group has been involved in for over 20 years we are all extremely shocked at the unexpected tragedy
5103569 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5103570 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5103571 unfortunately when the emergency services got to the casualties nothing could be done for them

5103575 this exercise will go a long way in improving the relations between the police and the public its a lot easier for the common man to reach us now
5103576 the mobile police station will also allay the fear of the police station atmosphere its like a pr exercise to reach the common man
5103577 this is very good for the people who are afraid of a police station anyone can lodge a complaint without fear its a very good step taken by the police department
5103578 so not only is john mccain blatantly violating his public financing pledge but hes doing it in grand style raising money in increments of up to 70 000 per donor more than 30 times the amount a donor can give to senator barack obamas general election campaign
5103579 we really have to ask ourselves if we cannot find a way of getting some kind of compromise which would get relatively immediate succour to at least a section of the population and by working together actually drive that through the parliament
5103580 we must stop beating ourselves up and start beating up the snp
5103581 even i did not imagine we would be third in the medals table i thought we would improve significantly from tenth but third is special
5103582 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance
5103583 our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain and we look forward to another great week of british sporting success
5103584 this is far beyond anyones expectations at this stage and one of the most notable features has been the extraordinary success of britains sportswomen this team is the best prepared ever and sets a standard for the run up to our own games in london in 2012 and the glasgow commonwealth games in 2014
5103585 i want this olympic period to be the time when the place of sport in society is changed forever
5103586 success at the very top does inspire people to take up sport britain has got much more serious about sport in the last ten years weve got to take this momentum and take it to a new level
5103587 im writing a book that will alter the american cultural and literary landscape
5103588 the important thing here i believe is that truth isnt outside power or lacking in power contrary to a myth whose history and functions would repay further study truth isnt the reward of free spirits the child of protracte solitude nor the privilege of those who have succeeded in liberating themselves truth is a thing of this world it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of power each society has its regime of truth its general politics of truth that is the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements the means by which one is sanctioned the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true it seems to me that what must now be taken into account in the intellectual is not the bearer of universal values rather its the person occupying a specific position but whose specificity is linked in a society like ours to the general functioning of an apparatus of truth the essential political problem for the intellectual is not to criticise the ideological contents supposedly linked to science or to ensure that his own scientific practise is accompanied by a correct ideology but that of ascertaining the possibility of constituting a new politics of truth the problem is not changing peoples consciousness or whats in their heads but the political economic institutional regime of the production of truth its not a matter of emancipating truth from every system of power which would be a chimera for truth is already power but of detaching the power of truth from the forms of hegemony social economic and cultural within which it operates at the present time

5103593 its pretty incredible im so proud of myself i wanted a gold i wanted to be a champion now ive put my mark down
5103594 i think the model should be replicated ive been involved in two of the top sports and theyre worlds apart british sport should look at the success cycling has had and model it if other british sports dont learn from us because we are team gb not just british cycling were not going to dominate at the london games
5103595 he is so without artifice he speaks directly from the heart
5103596 but were making a play for them by saying that obamas economic policies are the true patriotic ones
5103597 we are saying that we are patriotic in order to fool these redneck knuckle dragging bikers into voting for obama
5103598 i will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign and i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine
5103599 this is the largest structure fire that weve had in several years
5103600 with all the fire gear they have on its so hard
5103601 in a large operation its definitely more difficult to keep everyone out of harms way but weve got systems in place to do that
5103602 and hopefully when everythings set and done thats what weve accomplished

5103610 as a commodity exporting nation australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices
5103611 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally
5103612 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction
5103613 it is not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move
5103614 i think he is a very important player for the club you can see spurs without berbatov are a different team
5103615 they are huge players it will be very difficult to replace berbatov he is a class player he is not affected by anything around him
5103616 it would probably have been better and less painful walking but hopefully i havent made the old injury worse because that means i can come back
5103617 no if i felt i was really doing damage i would have stopped but it is horrible when you have to drop out especially when it is the olympic games so many people have worked hard to get me here and in some ways it is quicker to keep going because you are just left out there on your own if you stop somewhere

5103684 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store
5103685 much developer frustration comes from a lack of understanding of this process or from attempts to circumvent it
5103686 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels

5103695 in recent years i have seen a sharp rise in the discussion about the transportation challenges we face in texas
5103696 from the everyday commuter to large shippers most everyone seems to understand that something needs to be done however before we solve the problem we need to define the problem so we can properly align our limited resources
5103697 the vitality of any economy is linked to a viable transportation system to meet the growing competition from others texas must protect our prior investment in the transportation infrastructure while addressing the mobility needs of an expanding population
5103698 the charge of the 2030 committee is to define the transportation needs of texas
5103699 i congratulate texas governor rick perry and deirdre delisi for making the commitment to the future of our state by coordinating the 2030 committee by doing so they have taken important steps to assess texas transportation needs and to have suitable and responsive plans in place before those needs become critical
5103700 it is exciting to be a part of the planning process and contribute in any way i can toward securing the unencumbered movement of people and freight across texas over the next two decades

5103713 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets congressional quarterly reported this week that john mccain may have copied some facts in a recent speech on the georgian crisis from wikipedia i think it should have been obvious when he referred to the countrys leader as president 404 error file not found

5103724 thats what i heard i did know they talked with him but it is possible because they need some money it is possible that players are going
5103725 i dont know exactly except that maybe it is something like 6 million im not sure if they will shoot me now
5103726 in two games in the championship ive played little more than 30 minutes
5103727 its so frustrating all i can do when i get a little chance is come on and take it
5103728 hes that little bit extra special he can create a goal out of nothing if youve got that youve always got the edge hes almost a cult hero already as he was at southend and wolves theres plenty more to come from him
5103729 in the first half there was only one team in it and coventry scored against the run of play
5103730 i lost my rag because we were losing battles all over the pitch
5103731 it was powder puff stuff and im still angry now at what i saw in that first half but at least i got a response
5103732 liams injury is not serious but i still think we will have to bring in a new centre back
5103733 we never took our chances but conceded soft goals and if it means a change of personnel until we get it right then thats what well do
5103734 it wasnt a classic but it was important for us to get off the mark it took us until christmas to win away last season so thats progress
5103735 its pointless picking out someone to blame what pleased me is that i thought we upped our game from last weeks performance when we won at derby county i thought there was a lot of hype after that match but we played a good passing side and matched them
5103736 i will be working hard to bring someone in because its obvious we need a big physical presence up front
5103737 i think we were good value for the point and theres no doubt this is a positive result for us
5103738 it is never an easy place to come to and we are pleased to leave with a point even though its obviously slightly disappointing that we couldnt hold on for all three
5103739 andy lonergan came down the tunnel and said it was a penalty so what can you do when you talk about respect officials have got to earn respect it was two arms in the back of him and i could see it on the halfway line
5103740 i thought it was a penalty i havent seen it again but my first impression was that it was a penalty
5103741 it was good to see him out there and scoring goals ibrahima made a bad judgment call last season
5103742 we are not going to meet a reading every day and we have got one or two players who have yet to get settled in before i know what my strongest side is
5103743 if he keeps scoring like that then i would have paid 10 million for him and i think i would have been right to do that billy didnt get a run in the team and sometimes it takes time to step up a division and establish yourself and understand how defenders are better
5103744 we really had to play two games because after a superb first half we went in at 1 1 and then had to do it all again after the break i was very pleased with the performance and although there are areas we must still improve we played some fantastic football
5103745 it was an excellent game of football and we played well in the second half even missing a good chance to take the lead but it was a poor opening half an hour from us after drawing level i felt we could go on and win we were fortunate to get the equaliser either side could have scored at any point
5103746 it was a fair result i always do think its a very difficult game against charlton athletic weve had a lot of score draws and no score draws against them
5103747 hes bundled him over and into the box youre obviously taking a risk if it is a foul and i think kelly should get the benefit of the doubt until ive seen it again
5103748 he has been a revelation about the place and had to play after his goals in midweek we play with two wingers who are a threat to anybody on our own pitch and i am delighted everything has settled down so quickly
5103749 but it was completely different in the second half wolves could smell that one or two had given up and that was criminal it wont happen again

5103766 i didnt take too kindly to that and i rang donald workman an rbs executive and made it very clear i was not impressed with the lack of professionalism shown by the particular adviser and asked them to sort it out
5103767 board approval had already been received when that clearly wasnt the case
5103768 there was never any question in rbss mind that now the board may not wish to proceed for whatever reason
5103769 we had a situation where we entered into a non binding arrangement which was subject to board approval

5103783 collins stewarts share price would tend to imply that people dont think that a deal is forthcoming or that they dont think a deal is forthcoming at a level that would likely be acceptable to shareholders and therefore to terry

5103798 not just the fines and penalties or the loss of a drivers license but the fact that they kill people when they drive drunk

5103817 if this trash can is art then maybe you wont kick it over or step on it i thought it was pretty clever because it draws attention to things that you wouldnt normally think of as art and then it makes you rethink what is art what isnt art

5103849 so there we were just tooling down the dusty road in georgia me and my comrades in the tank column when suddenly all our tank commanders heads began exploding cant imagine how that could have happened if is wasnt an act of god and czar putin says he doesnt exist
5103850 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
5103851 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5103852 if mr swan thinks fuelwatch will save motorists 10 a tank hes deluding himself and misleading the australian people
5103853 all of the evidence is that fuelwatch will reduce competition and our most price sensitive motorists will end up paying more for their petrol
5103854 if mr swan cant get his sums right on this how can we have any confidence in his management of our 1 trillion economy
5103855 the petroleum group has the best chance of bringing home some big numbers this year following record high oil prices wiseowl com senior equities analyst simon guzowski said
5103856 the other major commodity earner for them is copper and while prices have fallen away in the last few weeks to a six month low up to june 30 prices were not far off record highs so that has to be a positive for bhps earnings he said
5103857 if bhp is able to demonstrate stronger growth in its production numbers than rio it would look to use these to try to convince asian buyers and european regulators that commodity supply is more likely to rise under a merged group he said
5103858 a number of miners have been hit quite hard by rising fuel processing machinery and labour costs mr guzowski said
5103859 were expecting a great result but because youve had so much change over the last month particularly in these commodity prices coming off the market will be more focused on those issues going forward stock resource managing director stephen bartrop said
5103860 the fact that the oil price is coming off its highs is a negative in the sense that the increase in earnings momentum for bhp is going to be diminished
5103861 we expect the bhp results followed by rio tintos a week later will show two sets of strong numbers with little to choose between them operationally said michael rawlinson an analyst at britains liberum capital
5103862 tropical storm fay threatens the state with a major disaster
5103863 fay is expected to reach hurricane strength in the south eastern gulf
5103864 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5103865 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5103866 currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5103867 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country
5103868 by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5103869 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5103870 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5103871 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more
5103872 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5103873 sunday is the day that visitors usually leave this area
5103874 but there are more leaving now a sign that the evacuation is going well
5103875 withdrawal without delay of all the that entered georgia since aug 7
5103876 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5103877 have just this morning sunday announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict on monday
5103878 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word
5103879 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5103880 no wonder truth is stranger than fiction fiction has to make sense
5103881 no wonder truth is stranger than fiction fiction has to make sense
5103882 no se vale lavarse las manos en un problema tan serio
5103883 i knew kyle was going to be tough on the restarts you know hes really good hes a heck of a competitor im just glad i got the jump on him there
5103884 i knew what he was going to do he was hanging back a little bit and he was going to get a run to make it really tough but we had the fastest car on the racetrack and im proud to be driving it today
5103885 were here to win championships and ten extra points is ten points and the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting those points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5103886 it just came down to when he beat us off pitroad that was it for us
5103887 we didnt quite have the car capable of being able to beat those guys today we were good there on that one run on one new set of tyres and thats pretty much all we had
5103888 had a great car to be able to come home second from where we were here in the spring we werent than competitive so to come out of here with second were happy with that at least weve got something to build on
5103889 we were nine out of a ten while those other guys were a ten
5103890 we gambled a little bit and knew the worst case would be finishing in the top five
5103891 it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it and if we had to do it all over again wed probably stayed out again and depending on how the caution came out we couldve finished second but here we are in third
5103892 du bist wertlos und kaputt gott hat dich verdammt du f hrst so oder so in die h lle
5103893 most of what you see is his input along with mine
5103894 he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things
5103895 i think there will be no problem it will be better for all of us
5103896 i think the security will get even better around here
5103897 we are just poor people what difference can it make to us
5103898 eight gold medals and 17 medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement
5103899 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance
5103900 we havent delivered at this level of consistency across some of the sports which i would call the formula one sports for many many generations
5103901 winning an olympic gold medal youre the best at what you do in the world
5103902 you just cant describe what sarah and i have been through for the last four years and with pippa for the last two
5103903 we sat down back in october and said we wanted to come here and win this
5103904 we knew greece would come back we had to have a solid middle 1000m to make sure we crossed the line first and then it was a case of holding on and keeping going
5103905 yesterday the breeze was very light and i couldnt give the american guy any chance to get away from me
5103906 today i was more confident with my speed against his and my fitness
5103907 its been so hard i cant explain what ive had to go through
5103908 i totally believe myself now i did before but that was the ultimate i was facing the demons i was up against tough opposition and a week ago it wasnt in me at all
5103909 it has been a fantastic week for us were all very proud of the teams achievement
5103910 however we have another seven days of competition and we want to deliver the same level of service and support
5103911 we dont want any complacency and right now theres not much time for celebration
5103912 undervalued the assets of the company and potentially would have adversely impacted the groups existing funding arrangements
5103913 and then a man called our exchange but didnt want to leave his name i guess that two can play the game of part time lovers

5103916 travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection
5103917 so you have nobody to travel with so what just go by yourself
5103918 this dbp project was designed to improve living conditions in the communities of the urban poor by providing financial assistance to qualified institutions and urban poor communities for site development home improvement livelihood endeavors and shelter finance services for poor urban households
5103919 the dbp is among the most reliable allies of the arroyo administrations anti poverty and social reform programs
5103920 the dbp implements this project for the benefit of urban poor communities outside metro manila through the assistance of the asian development bank adb and the cooperation of local government units microfinance institutions and non government organizations ngos

5103926 i was to a certain extent amused by the unreserved revelation of their crude if not uncivilised political culture and norms
5103927 i have instructed all youth wings of barisan component parties to ensure discipline ethics and noble values
5103928 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5103929 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5103930 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5103931 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5103932 ok at agora tudo fixe vamos meter mais m sicas
5103933 se n o gozamos a tecnologia ela n o nos serve
5103934 i think its pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
5103935 pass on as much of the cut as we prudently can
5103936 i dont know of any legislation that says that the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
5103937 a substantial proportion of their borrowing costs come down when the rba takes the decision to move rates down
5103938 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5103939 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5103940 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5103941 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5103942 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5103943 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5103944 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures
5103945 not crowded with other people new zealand press agency nzpa reported
5103946 last year in louisville the guy across the hall hanged himself
5103947 we have placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5103948 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological position or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5103949 as president i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5103950 i think barack obama is very likeable and emotional but he skirted the issues the evening definitely cemented my views
5103951 barack obama was just like a regular politician he didnt answer the questions
5103952 if it exists should we negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5103953 defeat it if i am president of the united states my friends i will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell and i will get him
5103954 weve got to drill now and weve got to drill here
5103955 if youve got book sales of 25m then you qualify
5103956 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family then you are middle class or youre poor if youre making more than 250 000 youre doing well
5103957 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5103958 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5103959 if youre just talking about income how about 5m it doesnt matter because i dont want to raise anyones taxes
5103960 it was just pastor rick and his wife she played the piano and he was the preacher now there are three main preachers in my household we call them the teacher the comic and the marketeer pastor rick is the marketing pastor he knows how to sell himself and the church and religion i dont know if he knows that thats what hes doing
5103961 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5103962 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5103963 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5103964 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5103965 begin the withdrawal of the military contingent moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5103966 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5103967 those who got fish said they had a great week
5103968 i think its almost exactly what we saw back in estonia
5103969 i really doubt this is any action by the russian government
5103970 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
5103971 why single out congressmen is it because it is good publicity for him at our expense
5103972 the lto has been issuing diplomatic plates even to non diplomats and has been too lenient in allowing the use of sirens and motorcycle escorts
5103973 cabinet secretaries undersecretaries senators and even the mmda metro manila development authority chief have their motorcycle escorts and sirens for all to see even his own boss at dotc department of transportation and communications has his own escorts and convoys why doesnt suansing apprehend them
5103974 congress only makes laws and our executive agencies like the lto are the ones that enforce them assistant secretary suansing should stop singling out congressmen and apply the law on everyone
5103975 apparently they were left by the people who checked in at the hotels
5103976 we have included it threats of bombings in our briefings that hotels and lodging inns would also be targets for such bombing activities
5103977 we thought it was another bomb but the owner of the package claimed it afterwards
5103978 we thank him pacquiao not only for joining in the torch run but for seeing the need to push and promote the integrated transformation program of the pnp
5103979 let us see the end of abuses committed by undesirables that will hinder our momentum for change to those who refuse to rise to the challenge i urge them to reform or perish
5103980 we cannot attain our vision as a modern police force unless we became real guardians of human rights protectors of the weak and defenders of the innocent
5103981 this is a very important day in the dvi process in the philippines and in the days and weeks ahead there is still a lot of complex forensic identification work to be done
5103982 the real picture of the military operations in mindanao is of mothers and their children scurrying for safety frightened and crowded in evacuation centers
5103983 the government places the total number of people displaced by armed conflict between 2000 and 2007 at 2 1 million
5103984 in january to august 2008 an estimated 190 000 people were displaced add to that the 160 000 people recently displaced due to the ongoing conflict in mindanao
5103985 women and children are already in danger with the present economic crisis the threat of poverty and hunger is very real the longer their condition is not alleviated the more they are at risk
5103986 we consider the bill absolutely unfair and highly discriminatory because it singles out registered professionals
5103987 how is the government actually going to require compliance when it is not in a position to physically bar professionals from leaving the country
5103988 we have a huge glut of professionals in many sectors in the case of nurses the main reason they are leaving the country is because wages here are grossly inadequate and the pay is meager precisely because of the massive surplus of nurses this is the law of supply and demand at work
5103989 the demand is so heavy that well known construction firm doosan heavy industries amp construction is willing to pay as much as 5 000 a month for architectural engineers
5103990 there is no placement fee for the professionals needed in dubai
5103991 if this arrangement is tolerated it would certainly spawn the abhorrent practice of contract substitution to the detriment of the filipino ocws
5103992 general razon initiated the meeting to address incidents of killings involving members of the media
5103993 we will coordinate with the nujp and possibly other media organizations so we can get information about their members who have been receiving threats so we can provide security or come up with measures that would prevent attack
5103994 gen razon has directed all police units to liaison with the media and ensure their safety we also advise media to report to the police any threat on their persons in line with their profession
5103995 we usually do not investigate killings of former members of the media because their cases do not fall under our mandate
5103996 president gloria macapagal arroyo had requested buc to oversee these efforts as she gives value to a deep consultative process to hear the views of stakeholders in the private sector the local government units lgus and all those who will be affected one way or the other in what may become a framework for peace and development not only for mindanao but the whole country as well
5103997 what are the possible scenarios they sc justices say proceed with the signing of the moa or continue negotiations but no signing or renegotiation of the moa
5103998 we must always follow the rule of law and we will await the decision of the sc
5103999 communication channels are now open and that is what is important
5104000 informal communications are okay but these should also lead to more formal and even face to face talks
5104001 we have a range of options that needs to be discussed
5104002 im sure theyre milf brainstorming on what to do based on what they glean from the mass media and other public pronouncements
5104003 im sure theyre both sides talking again now somehow i could imagine them talking about not aggravating the situation and sobriety im sure theyre talking about possible preparations because we cannot just throw away the peace process because of a ruling or skirmishes both sides are not losing sight of the objective of lasting peace
5104004 the use of the terms of reference that would imply that we will be setting up a new state is the difference between the initialed moa and new one
5104005 unlike the previously initialed moa the new one explicitly states that the agreement should be within legal and constitutional processes
5104006 this new working document is the one that people should examine and if they do so they would be calmed a bit
5104007 so their views can be heard while the agreement is being worked out and not after
5104008 senator pimentel is a mindanaoan a constitutionalist a friend of the muslims and a champion of the rule of law
5104009 this work of untangling the mess of the failed peace talks can be part of his legacy to the country
5104010 provided they are motivated by the sincere desire to attain peace in mindanao but not to exploit the process for scoring publicity points
5104011 if they are on board from day one they cant do a loud pontius pilate act later of washing their hands of the outcome because they are direct participants not spectators
5104012 if the peace agreement has some defects then the challenge is to perfect it and the best way to do it is for mindanaoans muslims christians and lumads alike to come to the table and forge a peace pact for mindanaoans by mindanaoans and of mindanaoans
5104013 on the contrary if you put them in one room their icy treatment of each other will soon thaw
5104014 the parties agree that the mechanisms and modalities for the actual implementation of this moa ad shall be spelt out in the comprehensive compact to mutually take such steps to enable it to occur effectively
5104015 this means that what are laid down in the moa are only general concepts and principles nothing in it is final and executory the modalities or terms of implementation will still be discussed therefore the door is open to mechanisms which may not necessary require charter change
5104016 the federal system is good not only for the bangsamoro land it will also fuel the growth of our provinces whose progress has been somewhat stunted by the centralized form of government
5104017 the fundamental law of the land is no longer responsive to the needs of the times if we want growth development and long term peace the constitution must be amended the sooner the better
5104018 that deals with adversity quite well and the population can rebound very quickly

5104029 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5104030 im the guy who raised the idea in august 2005 but if it doesnt happen our business plan isnt contingent on it
5104031 we are interested in doing it under the right circumstances

5104044 the reintroduction of turkey oak and the re invasion of gall wasps into northern europe may simply represent restoration of a previous natural situation
5104045 i sat down near the traffic light and i saw abu omar standing near the traffic light
5104046 he talked with some of the neighborhood people then one of my friends asked to go with him to drink a cup of tea in a shop across the street
5104047 after a while i saw a guy driving a motorcycle
5104048 he parked the motorcycle 65 feet from abu omars location and then he walked towards him after that the explosion happened
5104049 they told us that under any reasonable calculation the rest of them would go pretty quickly
5104050 four out of seven toilets were not flushing so for the comfort of our passengers we diverted to adelaide
5104051 its going to be a competition that may continue to go throughout the season

5104060 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5104061 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5104062 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5104063 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf in vitro fertilization and even the so called rhythm method
5104064 why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5104065 israel exported failed generals in order to train the georgian armed forces including general gal hirsch and we all know that the georgian army was defeated by the russian forces
5104066 defense minister ehud barak who accuses the political and security echelon of lacking experience during the period of the second lebanon war what can he say to his failures during his term as prime minister particularly the hasty departure from lebanon
5104067 i also remind idf chief of staff gabi ashkenazi of his failures during the period when he served as goc northern command they both failed then and therefore they dont scare us today
5104068 theres no such thing as love like in the movies the kind of love that someone is supposed to have for another the kind that says no matter what or who you are i still love you
5104069 i do what pastors do and he does what politicians do
5104070 the board confirms that it did receive an indicative proposal and that it has been rejected
5104071 the offer undervalued the retail assets the cashflow and the potential profits of the business
5104072 involved a complex restructuring which in practical terms is not achievable
5104073 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5104074 obviously were very sad by the deaths mr thew said
5104075 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5104076 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5104077 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5104078 apparently he was a very capable skier its believed he may have clipped another persons ski which caused him to go off course it was just an accident its one of those very unfortunate things
5104079 relieving chronic pain may just be the most misunderstood concept in healthcare
5104080 unfortunately the story of specialist pain services in scotland is one of chronic failure
5104081 the drugs are coming in more and more to the community
5104082 there were some people from outside selling somewhere else like coober pedy or marla or mintabie
5104083 people who are drug traders now we know who they are and they bring drugs to the community
5104084 we see good things like the church and other things the government are supporting and helping and make sure that the community are really happy with what they need
5104085 this conference will contain graphic and sexually explicit images which previous attendees have said were personally and politically challenging but extremely worthwhile
5104086 it is impossible to comment on pornography for example if we are not fully aware of the content of what is now in the mainstream
5104087 things have really moved on over the past five to 10 years we need to get a grasp of what is out in our communities and what images and representations of women are being consumed
5104088 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5104089 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5104090 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5104091 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5104092 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5104093 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5104094 we cant keep these great people staff and coaches in australia because we dont have the funding
5104095 any criticism of ken is unwarranted because ken has to earn a living i cant provide that financial recompense for him i cant do that with the budgets we have
5104096 i think it would be very hard for us to impose some restriction on their ability to earn a living

5104294 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery

5104333 saya riset bertahun tahun saya sadar bahwa negeri ini 50 dikelilingi laut yang sangat kaya biota laut atau semacam plangton bisa diolah menjadi minyak mentah dan hasilnya berupa bbm setara pertamax karena kadar oktannya sudah mendekati 94 dan harga jualnya cukup menggiurkan karena hanya rp 1 500 per liter
5104334 jadi memang sangat murah sekali dan dipastikan rakyat indonesia tidak mengeluh boros mengeluarkan uang untuk membeli bbm yang saat ini teramat mahal
5104335 nantinya temuan ini akan saya serahkan ke pemerintah biar mereka yang mengelola disamping itu agar rakyat di negeri ini menjadi makmur
5104336 biota laut jenis ini tidak terlihat mana batang daun ataupun bunga karena bentuknya sama semua dan jenis ini memang bisa dikembangkan di darat dengan kadar kelembapan udara tertentu
5104337 atau orang biasa menyebutnya cara penyulingan relatif lebih murah dari langkah yang pertama karena dengan sistem pemanasan akan dipisahkan menjadi bahan bakar padat cair dan gas

5104354 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5104374 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5104375 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5104376 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5104377 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5104378 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5104379 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5104380 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5104397 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5104398 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5104399 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5104400 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5104401 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5104402 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5104409 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5104410 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5104411 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5104412 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5104413 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5104414 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5104415 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5104416 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5104417 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5104418 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5104419 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5104420 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5104421 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5104422 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5104423 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5104424 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5104425 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5104426 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5104427 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5104428 can there be any thing more ridiculous than that a father should waste his own money and his sons time in setting him to learn the roman language when at the same time he designs him for a trade wherein he having no use of latin fails not to forget that little which he brought from school
5104429 outside a handful of majors engineering and some of the sciences a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance even a degree in a vocational major like business administration can mean anything from a solid base of knowledge to four years of barely remembered gut courses
5104430 the solution is not better degrees but no degrees young people entering the job market should have a known trusted measure of their qualifications they can carry into job interviews that measure should express what they know not where they learned it or how long it took them they need a certification not a degree

5104481 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
5104482 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
5104483 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
5104484 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5104485 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5104486 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5104487 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5104488 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5104489 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5104490 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5104491 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5104492 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5104493 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5104494 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5104499 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5104500 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5104501 at present it looks as if there will be a delay commencing on site but as soon as we have a confirmed date we will issue a full update to all
5104502 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5104503 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5104504 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5104505 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5104506 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5104507 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5104508 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5104509 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5104510 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5104511 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5104512 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5104513 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5104514 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5104515 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5104516 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5104517 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5104518 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5104519 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5104520 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5104521 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5104522 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5104523 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5104524 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5104525 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5104526 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5104527 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5104528 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5104529 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5104530 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5104531 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5104532 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5104533 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5104534 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5104535 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5104536 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5104537 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5104538 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5104539 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5104540 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5104541 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5104542 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5104543 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5104544 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5104545 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5104546 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5104547 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5104548 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5104549 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5104550 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5104551 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5104552 therefore nothing in the wto would require epas to cover trade in services and trade related disciplines on investment competition government procurement or intellectual property
5104553 but here a word of caution for acp if as it looks likely at present the majority of ldcs least developed countries accept wto plus provisions in the epas in areas such as services competition and investment policies it will be very hard to sustain resistance to such measures at the wto

5104557 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5104558 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5104559 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5104560 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5104561 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
5104562 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
5104563 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
5104564 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
5104565 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
5104566 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
5104567 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
5104568 i would like to buy 5 lots of usd jpy during the market with a stop loss of 102 45 and a take profit of 102 62
5104569 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry

5104571 impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
5104572 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
5104573 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
5104574 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
5104575 a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is certainly a more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline
5104576 have mercy on me o lord son of david my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon
5104577 send her away for she is crying out after us
5104578 i was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel
5104579 it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
5104580 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
5104581 o woman great is your faith be it done for you as you desire
5104582 son of david have mercy on me son of david have mercy on me son of david have mercy on me
5104583 lord shes driving us nuts tell her to get out of here
5104584 i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel
5104585 its not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
5104586 yes lord canaanite dog i may be call me whatever you wish its true theres no way around that im a dog ill accept that yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
5104587 god relishes surprise we want lives of simple predictable ease smooth even trails as far as the eye can see but god likes to go off road he provokes us with twists and turns he places us in predicaments that seem to defy our endurance and comprehension and yet dont by his love and grace we persevere the challenges that make our hearts leap and stomachs churn invariably strengthen our faith and grant measures of wisdom and joy we would not experience otherwise
5104588 the unique status of marriage between and man and a woman
5104589 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5104590 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5104591 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5104592 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead some shops nearby were damaged he said
5104593 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5104594 the two sides are likely to start talks in september for an agreement in services and investment and hope to conclude negotiations by december 2009
5104595 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5104596 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5104597 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5104598 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5104599 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5104600 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5104601 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5104602 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5104603 were out about 1 000 from deposits and moving in
5104604 were going to help narrow down the list send them to only properties that meet their requirements and have the ability to move them in right away
5104605 hopefully lower some of the stress some of the burden because theyre not in the business of looking for apartments and we are
5104606 the company is offering a no deposit and no application fee for them to move over here now
5104607 they want to turn us into what they see as enlightened people of the world who will integrate into israeli society
5104608 but we do not want to integrate into that society because of its many temptations

5104614 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5104615 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5104616 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5104617 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5104618 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5104622 thats possibly a little more trouble for us because of the volume of the traffic and speed

5104628 amp you know we laugh about it but we cry amp we should cry because a congress is supposed to be careful stewards of your tax dollars so what did ay just do in a middle of an energy crisis when in california we are paying 4 a gallon for gas went on vacation for five weeks i guarantee you two things ay never miss a pay raise amp a vacation amp we should stop that amp call am back amp not raise your taxes we should not amp cannot raise taxes in tough economic times so it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is because i dont want to raise anybodys taxes

5104724 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5104725 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5104726 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present

5104772 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5104773 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5104774 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5104775 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5104776 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5104777 this is a planning took where all things are going
5104778 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5104779 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5104780 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5104781 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5104782 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5104783 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5104784 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5104785 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5104786 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5104787 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5104788 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5104789 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5104790 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5104791 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5104792 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5104793 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5104794 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5104795 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5104796 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5104797 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5104798 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5104799 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5104800 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5104801 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5104802 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5104803 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5104804 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5104805 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5104806 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5104807 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5104808 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5104809 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5104810 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5104811 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5104812 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5104813 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5104814 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5104815 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5104816 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5104817 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5104818 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5104819 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5104820 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5104821 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5104822 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5104823 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5104824 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5104825 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5104826 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5104827 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5104828 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5104829 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5104830 people sometimes want to wear just a t shirt and a pair of jeans rather than buying the entire gucci collection
5104831 i think i can do less of the made in italy people dont want to be dressed from head to toe
5104832 we are sorry that dasha has not appreciated italian brands for her boutique
5104833 but we are sure that in private she has a great consideration for them seeing that she continues to wear italian fashion in public
5104834 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
5104835 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
5104836 this is just a redeployment they have pulled out of their bases but they are still all over the place you can see that it doesnt matter which uniforms the russians wear
5104837 they have continued aggression taken over new areas and have mined new bridges russian generals have told us they have two options they can withdraw or advance to the capital they are still waiting for orders on what course to take
5104838 we shall defend the capital most of our forces are intact and most of our weapons are intact
5104839 the cease fire was signed by president medvedev on saturday and this must happen in the next few days
5104840 i think we will be in georgia for a very long time
5104841 they have stolen everything and burnt the houses they are killing young men saying they are georgian soldiers when the men were just farmers
5104842 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5104843 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5104844 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5104845 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5104846 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5104847 they are very aware of the inequality in the system
5104848 the most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the department of womens affairs it is not just us pushing our ideas on to them
5104849 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects
5104850 most of what you see is his input along with mine
5104851 he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things
5104852 i think there will be no problem it will be better for all of us
5104853 i think the security will get even better around here
5104854 we are just poor people what difference can it make to us
5104855 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5104856 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day
5104857 unless the board is able to secure new capital the future ability of the company to trade must be considered uncertain
5104858 these problems if unresolved would have significant implications for the companys production targets and cash flow
5104859 looking at the positives in the service sector new orders continue to remain above the water level of 50 points showing ongoing expansion that will flow through to general activity in the months ahead three of the four major regions showed some level of recovery while canterbury westland remains steady albeit at a lower level than on average
5104860 get the jonas brothers to play somewhere near front royal virginia
5104861 there are other girls my age soothing hangovers from ther wild parties from the night before caught up in the drama of their whirlwind romances and what am i doing learning about the earths crust
5104862 it has given me heaps of personal satisfaction and allowed me to do what i have enjoyed
5104863 but i dont look back i just look forward to the future
5104864 its my move and there are personal reasons for it but this is a positive way to move forward with it
5104865 country music radio will continue to come from tamworth and i have great support to do so it gets in your blood
5104866 communities and businesses are more aware than ever of the need to reduce the impact on the environment
5104867 country energy is no exception to that in fact we see our role in helping to educate our customers about energy efficiency while we manage our own sustainability challenges as one of the primary responsibilities underpinning our business
5104868 its all a big part of what we do and we want to get involved and make sure were doing our part for the environment
5104869 the conference was an absolute success and it wasnt just executives who were involved we had team leaders and up here
5104870 ive been talking with a number of them and they all have an absolute knowledge of where they stand and appreciated getting recognised
5104871 country energys planting of 150 trees is great for the environment
5104872 farmers are basing their hopes on more spring rains to help them through the season
5104873 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
5104874 the drought is not only hitting rural areas hard city dwellers are paying the price at supermarkets for staples such as rice
5104875 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year however we really need good rain before the end of august
5104876 farmers have a few other challenges on their hands as well with widespread frosts limiting pasture growth however grazing cereals have provided valuable feed
5104877 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest
5104878 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5104879 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations
5104880 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5104881 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5104882 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars

5104887 of course i do i love you more than anyone else
5104888 morality is not grounded ultimately in gods commands but in his character which then expresses itself in his commands
5104889 obviously were very sad by the deaths mr thew said
5104890 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5104891 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5104892 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5104893 apparently he was a very capable skier its believed he may have clipped another persons ski which caused him to go off course it was just an accident its one of those very unfortunate things
5104894 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5104895 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5104896 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5104897 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5104898 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5104899 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5104900 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5104901 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5104902 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5104903 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5104904 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5104905 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5104906 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5104907 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5104908 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5104909 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5104910 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5104911 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5104912 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5104913 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5104914 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5104915 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5104916 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5104917 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5104918 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5104919 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5104920 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5104921 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5104922 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5104923 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5104924 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5104925 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5104926 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5104927 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5104928 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5104929 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5104930 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5104931 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5104932 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5104933 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5104934 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5104935 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5104936 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5104937 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5104938 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5104939 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional

5104949 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5104950 theres pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
5104951 we will remove the restrictions as soon as the situation is under control
5104952 for too long cleaning has been viewed as a cost to be minimised and a substantial investment in the cleaning sector is urgently needed
5104953 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms

5104958 in any war it is always the children who are the biggest losers children whose voices are rarely heard
5104959 war was just for oil and for money grubbing americans
5104960 yeah man but 70 of those killed are in developing countries
5104961 do you have any idea how many drivers came from those developing countries have you ever been in a cab the streets are literally filled with cabs driven by drivers from developing countries
5104962 which is unquestionably the greatest sci fi movie ever made
5104963 for the life of me i cant understand why they didnt see each other
5104964 we noticed it was flying low and literally within a split second we saw a light aircraft come in from the right
5104965 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5104966 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game those are still things you must do no matter who youre playing these are games you would like to win but its baseball so you never know
5104967 i think its still a little sore but i felt better better than the last couple of weeks
5104968 i had a lot of sinkers for ground balls i threw the breaking pitches when i needed them
5104969 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5104970 as of now were playing the game monday if the storm runs in its current path tuesday would be in doubt we should know monday night about tuesday
5104971 there is no talk about moving games to another city after monday the angels possibly could go to miami or atlanta that depends on the path of the storm and whether we have to evacuate
5104972 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can
5104973 from my standpoint i think hes going to be just fine
5104974 theres some pretty significant damage that didnt show up on the first mri
5104975 that first inning it seemed like everything fell for them
5104976 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5104977 did ya hear about marcus smashing his quota a month before quarter end how does he do it
5104978 hes a freak i hear hes big on lead generation and knows the marketing guys really well last week i saw him over there with chocolates hes pretty friendly with fiona by the way are you going to friday drinks
5104979 no question at receiver in specific plays for matchups when you consider speed and size
5104980 it is similar kind of to a jonny harline type of matchup where hes big enough fast enough and physical enough when you put him on a smaller defensive back thats a matchup problem and possibly he will play as a returner i think he will have a role and i think hell help us
5104981 i have to go out there and to it so i can get it in my head
5104982 i am getting the routes down a lot more i just have to get the plays down better all i can do is ask questions and learn because i just want to play wherever i can play i will play

5104991 most current laptop bags will not present a clear x ray image and should not be sent through the x ray with the laptop inside
5104992 what the hell are you guys doing here this doesnt concern you
5104993 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5104994 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled
5104995 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with western countries to integrate its stations with governments with an interest in receiving data of the situation in space
5104996 unfortunately its one of those cases where we may never know
5104997 this figure is bound to increase as growing cities coincide with escalating food shortages to create a squeeze on agricultural water supply
5104998 while it may be theoretically forbidden it is unofficially tolerated
5104999 i am worried about the toxins especially heavy metals accumulating in foods like root crops
5105000 but often there is simply no other water in many ways it is a great use of the waste and the nutrients it contains
5105001 even without expensive infrastructure common sense measures can make wastewater irrigation safer
5105002 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5105003 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5105004 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5105005 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5105006 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5105007 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5105008 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5105013 there could be no more appropriate recognition of chris hoys superb achievements at the beijing olympics than a knighthood
5105014 chris has been such an inspiration and a knighthood would be fitting recognition for his hard work and leadership that saw him win both an individual gold and another in the team sprint in beijing over the last couple of days
5105015 chris hoys achievement will inspire more people to come forward at the 2012 olympics in london and the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow
5105016 im sure everyone in scotland will have their fingers crossed for hoy in his final event
5105017 its been an eventful day and so many things happen you just try and block it all out and focus on your ride and focus on your performance and thats what i did
5105018 to finish with one two on the podium thats just unbelievable
5105019 this has been the most successful weekend ever for scottish olympians and they are doing themselves and the country extremely proud
5105020 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
5105021 over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine
5105022 i am aware that a large number of mourners will be attending the funeral of this well respected mp and that access to the area of the church is essential
5105023 how then could i do this great wickedness and sin against god
5105024 i dont suppose for a moment that joseph did it but i can see ill have no peace until i get him out of the house
5105025 do not interpretations belong to god please tell them to me
5105026 even though you intended to do me harm god intended it for good
5105027 why is god doing this to me ive tried to be a good person why is he punishing me
5105028 even though you intended to do me harm god intended it for good
5105029 grace cannot stand it when we want to give something to god or establish merit or pay him with our works this is the greatest of blasphemies and idolatries and is nothing less than the denial and even ridicule of god

5105039 the drugs are coming in more and more to the community
5105040 there were some people from outside selling somewhere else like coober pedy or marla or mintabie
5105041 people who are drug traders now we know who they are and they bring drugs to the community
5105042 we see good things like the church and other things the government are supporting and helping and make sure that the community are really happy with what they need
5105043 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5105044 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5105045 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5105046 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5105047 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5105048 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5105049 we do need to change the culture to ensure the system remains effective and efficient if it is to survive
5105050 certainly there is a culture of overtime in correctional centres and an expectation that it will be provided as a right rather than as a privilege
5105051 high levels of overtime can obviously impact not only on performance of work but also on the work life balance
5105052 when persons are working very lengthy periods of overtime obviously there is a threat to their health and safety but also to those who they interact with
5105053 its no use trying to deal with a system that is growing by putting on part time and casual people temporary people
5105054 you put on permanent people who can learn under the experienced officers that know the job you dont fix it up by casuals and part timers
5105055 as i said earlier i believe we do need to put in steps so that weve got more staff and so that officers dont have to work massive amounts of overtime just to keep the department going
5105056 i think they must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme
5105057 its an election promise but there must be other ways that that can be dealt with
5105058 we want the least cost abatement that is the lowest cost to reducing our emissions

5105068 although the rhetoric of economic debate is about accelerating economic growth the reality of politics is mainly about redistributing income
5105069 in new zealand the economic rhetoric in elections is about improving the economy the economic dog whistles are about what is in it for the voters

5105073 in view of these considerations the court is of the opinion and so holds that the present complaint must be as it is hereby dismissed for lack of merits without costs
5105074 art 97 a petition for legal separation may be filed 1 for adultery on the part of the wife and for concubinage on the part of the husband as defined in the penal code or 2 an attempt by one spouse against the life of the other
5105075 in the prosecutions for frustrated or attempted homicide the intention to take life must be proved with the same degree of certainty as is required with respect to other elements of the crime and the inference of such intent should not be drawn in the absence of circumstances sufficient to prove such intention beyond reasonable doubt people vs villanueva 51 phil 448 it is absolutely necessary that the homicidal intent be evidenced by adequate acts which at the time of their execution were unmistakably calculated to produce the death of the victim since the crime of frustrated or attempted homicide is one in which more than in any other case the penal law is based upon the material results produced by the criminal act it is not proper or just to attribute to the delinquent a specific intent to commit the higher crime in the absence of proof to justify such a conclusion u s vs taguibao 1 phil 16 conformably to this rule therefore an accused who upon seeing a man plowing the land which was the subject matter of a dispute immediately attacks the latter inflicting blows upon his neck with the back of the bolo must be convicted of physical injuries and not of frustrated homicide because the mere fact that the assault was committed with the back instead of the cutting edge of the bolo negatives the idea of homicidal intent and precludes the crime from constituting frustrated homicide
5105076 nothing is more difficult to discover than intention this being a mental act we are only able to deduce it from the external acts performed by the agent and when these acts have naturally given a definite result courts should not without clear and conclusive proof hold that some other result was intended u s vs mendoza 38 phil 691 693 gt it is always to be remembered that the first and simplest presumption which as stated above the law draws with respect to human conduct in connection with acts of violence is that the actor intended the natural consequence of his acts and this presumption should be implied in a fair and rational way with proper regard to all the details of the act and without the suppression of any of its elements likewise where the accused inflicted a scalp wound with a hatchet and struck at his victim a second time it should not be inferred from the mere fact that a hatchet in the hands of an infuriated man is a deadly weapon that the accused really intended to kill people vs villanueva 51 phil 488 when criminal liability is made to consist in the intention to perform an act which was not realized the facts from which it is claimed that intention sprang must be such as to exclude all contrary supposition when this intention is not necessarily disclosed by the acts performed by the defendant greater importance should not be given to such acts than that which they in themselves import nor should the defendants liability be extended beyond that which is actually involved in the material results of the act
5105077 homicide criminal intent when the case affords no good reason for holding that the assailants positively intended to kill the injured party in spite of the persistent and repeated beatings they gave him however much they plainly demonstrated their intention of doing him injury by striking him in an inhuman manner on various parts of his body it is improper to classify the crime as either frustrated or attempted homicide a personal assault must be punished according to its consequences and the harm done to the victim for the penal law in this class of crimes is only concerned with the material results produced by the transgression unless the perverse intention of taking the victims life be clearly manifested

5105119 europe wants to mediate but it is so divided itself that it too requires mediation for moscow which is acting from a position of strength since its campaign it will be easy to use this division for its own purposes the kremlin wants to expand its influence and to keep neighboring countries which that aspire to the west in a state of permanent instability the e u has no interest in allowing this but given the disharmony they have little to oppose the russians with this war sends a very clear signal that together with the united states its high time to restrict russias sphere of influence however not all want to hear that signal
5105120 you only had to listen to the response he got coming off the field that might be a response for both sides to the standard hes doing his best if weve got a few things where we need points of clarification well do that
5105121 wed earned a penalty count in our favour and in the second half it reversed a bit i think it finished 10 8 it had been substantially in our favour
5105122 that particular referee weve had today has come up in many of our conversations with the nrl
5105123 not just in our games ive observed him refereeing other teams and strings of penalties and weeks ago it was an 11 1 count at shark park
5105124 the whole thing today was a muddle it wasnt a game of footy it was hard to understand some of the things that happened
5105125 i love nothing more than playing football and winning with the boys
5105126 no my friend said there was a big fight at the cordova mall and someone got shot at the victorias secret

5105129 we noticed it was flying low and literally within a split second we saw a light aircraft come in from the right
5105130 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5105131 as much as any of them he was a joy to watch you never knew what was coming next it could be an underhand pass for a completion it could be a laser for 50 yards that made your jaw drop it could be a terribly forced pass that made his coaches wince

5105135 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results

5105138 i think the important part is to meet the veterans where theyre at and make sure that theyre aware of resources so that when theyre ready to accept help that they know it is available to them
5105139 talk with their family and their support to see if they notice any differences since theyve been home but also to come into the va and talk with us get enrolled and we can go over services
5105140 alongside traditional subjects such as history and maths children will be obliged to attend marching lessons and special courses on how to react to crises such as impending nuclear attack terrorist bombs or hostage taking there will be special drills with gas masks
5105141 the climax will come at the end of each summer term when all boys over the age of 15 will be made to spend a week at a miliary training camp where retired army officers will teach them how to assemble and fire kalashnikovs they will also use mortars practise various fighting techniques and dig trenches girls will be taught first aid
5105142 the classes in military patriotic education would turn pupils into better citizens
5105143 some have questioned the need for compulsory training given that there are special army training camps where parents can send their children during summer breaks if they wish
5105144 at cascae a summer boot camp close to moscow young russians already undergo training that differs little from that for special forces serving in chechnya
5105145 clad in full camouflage uniforms chidren as young as nine are put through a grueling training course it includes mock clashes and ambushes and lessons in how to use weapons such as axes knives and kalashnikovs children are even taught how to handle a rocket propelled grenade launcher

5105183 especially when he was behind in counts get a strike over and get back into the at bat someone said he threw 30 something and thats probably 10 times as many as hes used to throwing but a lot of them were strikes and he was able to get back into counts like he wanted to it was effective

5105233 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5105234 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5105235 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5105236 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already
5105237 das war definitiv ein guter tag den wir auch gebraucht haben denn andere jungs hatten ganz sch n pech platz acht in michigan ist f r uns wie ein sieg wir waren in den vergangenen wochen ziemlich konstant und hoffentlich bringen wir das auch in den chase mit hin ber
5105238 i was able to be a part of three relays where we were able to put up a solid team effort
5105239 we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well
5105240 espeically to be part of something as special as this
5105241 i just think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and something that helped me
5105242 hes done a wonderful job an incredible racer and hes a nice guy a good bloke
5105243 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
5105244 i was able to be a part of three relays where we were able to put up a solid team effort
5105245 we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well
5105246 espeically to be part of something as special as this
5105247 i just think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and something that helped me
5105248 hes done a wonderful job an incredible racer and hes a nice guy a good bloke
5105249 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
5105250 kyle is really good on restarts and i wasnt going to let him get the kind of run on me that he got on jimmie johnson a few weeks ago
5105251 so i just didnt want to have to go through the pain i did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5105252 he has been all year hes the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half two mile racetracks hes been decent at the other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and theres a lot of those in the chase
5105253 those are racetracks that i feel like we need to gain on i dont feel like we struggled there in the first part of the year
5105254 but we need to get better at qualifying up front at those tracks so we dont have to fight for track position all day so we can just run our own race and try to keep up in the top five top 10 if we can get better at passing guys at those tracks thatll make it easier
5105255 we didnt qualify well obviously starting 27th makes it a little tense early in the race but carl did a great job with the car coming through the field
5105256 we were pretty loose there and the 18 was able to stretch a pretty big lead from laps 142 to 165 having the ability to pit again and work on the car when the debris caution was called on lap 166 was a relief carl did a great job from there on out
5105257 were getting to the point that we can win at any race track we go to
5105258 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time the guys have repeatedly worked harder week after week to become better so yea i feel confident at all the race tracks we go to
5105259 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver that ever lived know what im saying david pearson told me that if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
5105260 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take an unnecessary risk and take out a top five finish or finish 20th
5105261 the 18 and the 99 were just a little better than us and after we didnt pit for tires that last run we were going to be sitting ducks depending on how the cautions worked out
5105262 i just drove as hard as i could and tried not to make any mistakes at this point in the season a third place is great a win wouldve been better but a 20th place finish would have been devastating for us trying to make the chase
5105263 we made stupid choices dash malfunctions motor problems at this point we dont deserve to be in the chase
5105264 we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts
5105265 my spotter didnt say anything until the last second he said two cars on the outside instead of three wide ultimately were responsible
5105266 we finally got an awesome race car and we just didnt have the total package today its very disappointing its kind of been the way our seasons gone we get the pit stops awesome and we cant get the car right what are you going to do
5105267 im relieved because weve been going in every week going well we cant take too big of a risk but we got to push hard enough
5105268 loose then tight loose then tight we were struggling all afternoon
5105269 we had some really good pit stops and had the fedex office toyota running in the top 10 before it all came apart everyone on the team is working really hard we just need consistency
5105270 we are falling behind getting into the chase and need to be more consistent we just cant seem to get there every week its something at this point we dont deserve to be in the chase
5105271 ill be glad to talk to you about the fourth car next week at bristol
5105272 david is certainly in the mix but theres a lot of balls still in the air right now
5105273 we hope to have something done in the next week or two but nothings set yet
5105274 hell run some cup races this year whether or not hes running the full thing next year or not
5105275 which ones were going to run with him were still in the process of laying out how that works
5105276 were just trying to figure out when can we gear up and do that ourselves internally
5105277 i love talking to people and finding out their opinion
5105278 i dont know if this type of show can work in daytime
5105279 she probably is the best talk show guest on television
5105280 weve had some good success in the marketplace with comedic talent
5105281 the key to all this is making the show an extension of the hosts personality and bonnie has a strong point of view a strong sense of who she is
5105282 i asked if theres an end of a scene that doesnt feel like its working can you improvise
5105283 it didnt seem like womens careers were really launched on that show
5105284 if you can maintain your standards and your integrity and you fail its ok its when you sell out and you fail that you feel pretty sick inside
5105285 the great task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty into something that is art
5105286 can we not only emulate but can we blow right past apple
5105287 maybe you should actually try using gnome for a month or so instead of keep repeating your often wrong assumptions you know what last night i put my money where my mouth is i did something better than any gnome user has apparently ever done i actually wrote the code to fix the thing
5105288 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5105289 being pain free in the latter part of the year i started feeling confident
5105290 from may on it was getting better and better now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5105291 still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5105292 you got your investments worth then take it w a grain of salt and conform they didn t bs you
5105293 no one cares where you are from where you have been or who you played with the fact is you are here now and that s all anyone will see the game has changed so much in the last several years that if you don t keep up and absorb these changes to conform just forget it
5105294 we don t need to bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
5105295 if all your band really wants to do is play local gigs and be local rock stars that s fine there s no need to even dream about a record deal so play your hearts out doing what you love but to want and get a record deal requires treating your band like a business
5105296 you couldnt have six husbands and wives as the cockerels would fight one always has to be the master of the flock with the bantams its a bit different they tend to stick to their breeds and we only have one pair of each breed
5105297 but how do they know that they are the same breed without mirrors
5105298 what happens if you get cockerels in a brood of chicks
5105299 we try and find homes for them its difficult as most people only want hens collecting eggs each day is fun cockerels used to be fattened up for the pot now people are a bit squeamish about eating their own stock especially if they have to kill them
5105300 my aunt keeps chickens buys hatching eggs from breeders and has never had to deal with a cockerel for the last twenty years
5105301 we have plenty of time to work on it i reminded him and then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever
5105302 my jerking came to a stop heat flooded through me stronger than before but it was a new kind of heat not a burning everything inside me came undone as i stared at the tiny porcelain face of the half vampire half human baby the gravity of the earth no longer tied me to the place where i stood it was the baby girl in the blond vampires arms that held me here now
5105303 i smiled and raised my arms straight out as if i were going to dive lifting my face into the rain but it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool feet first first time i leaned forward crouching to get more spring
5105304 it was there sitting in the lunchroom trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers that i first saw them they were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria as far away from where i sat as possible in the long room there were five of them the last was lanky less bulky with untidy bronze colored hair he was more boyish than the others who looked like they could be in college or even teachers here rather than students thats edward hes gorgeous of course but dont waste your time he doesnt date apparently none of the girls here are good looking enough for him she sniffed a clear case of sour grapes i wondered when hed turned her down
5105305 i didnt realize i was crying until it was time to say the binding words
5105306 it was like hed never kissed me like this was our first kiss and in truth hed never kissed me this way before it almost made me feel guilty surely i was in breach of the contract i couldnt be allowed to have this too
5105307 i need to stop doing this rubbish i want treatment
5105308 its the highest damage bill for a puffed up piece of shit since corey

5105312 the school has taken action against the students however we have yet to establish who provoked the attack and how the fight occurred
5105313 we have discussed punishment with their parents but my department is still deliberating whether any action will be taken against the school itself
5105314 this is because the school failed to report the matter to us immediately
5105315 once we receive a report from a school our officers will conduct an investigation within seven days
5105316 the countrys economy reputation as well as its stability will be damaged if nothing is done to stop fraud within organisations
5105317 the seriousness of economic crime cannot be overstated as studies conducted by numerous research companies around the world prove how rampant it is
5105318 both the tok guru nik aziz and president agreed to talks with umno as part of pas dakwah
5105319 if the lido boulevard project is allowed to proceed next month it will only strengthen singapore strategically
5105320 vessels passing by the johor straits will have to enter singapores water
5105321 if the project is to proceed they might as well extend the reclamation works of lido boulevard and create a second causeway to singapore because malaysian territorial waters will not be there anymore
5105322 a bridge built after lido boulevard will mean singapore controlling the waterways and shipping in the area with johor having voluntarily discarded the johor straits by dumping millions of tonnes of sands to build luxury condominiums
5105323 the service by the immigration authorities is fast and friendly
5105324 most indonesians here work in the construction sector and as domestic helpers
5105325 however if there are indonesian citizens involved in unhealthy activities they should be brought to court and charged
5105326 checks showed that there are many types of imported helmets in the market without sirim certification these helmets do not have safety features and are a danger to motorcyclists
5105327 a helmet which is kept in a dark room and not used at all carries a shelf life of about six years
5105328 however those used frequently and exposed to the sun and rain could only last for about three years
5105329 i want him to sue me this man is not interested in telling the truth instead he hides behind his blog in court he hides behind his wifes skirt
5105330 if raja petra wants an independent arbitration on this matter with independent arbitrators chosen by joint consent between him and me i will gladly accept it and challenge him to produce the proof of his allegations
5105331 it all started from a rumour saying that i was likely to be appointed prosecutor against anwar this is not true
5105332 somebody thought it was very dangerous to have me as a prosecutor and raja petras articles are aimed at discrediting me he is a puppet for political animals
5105333 i have independent evidence both oral and documentary that will show that neither the office of shafee amp co nor this conference room where you reporters and photographers are sitting in or the white board you are looking at nor i personally are involved in anything close to the allegation by raja petra that we are involved in a conspiracy relating to the sodomy case
5105334 i have been away in kuching and terengganu for more than six weeks prior to anwar being charged i was away from june 28 to aug 7 continuously with one week in kuala terengganu all of them related to my work in relation to three election petitions
5105335 why should the police want to do a black operation in this room dont you think a black operation by its nature is secretive this room has big windows even the gardeners can see in and it is being monitored 24 hours by cctv closed circuit television camera
5105336 once in the system the virus will always be there it will come out when the time is right so it comes down to controlling it
5105337 coconut water will help in controlling or suppressing the virus
5105338 one can make the safe assumption that coconut water too would have anti viral components
5105339 the front gate was partially open when four men arrived in an mpv
5105340 one of them pulled out a parang and demanded our valuables while his accomplice tried to drive off with the car
5105341 but he could not drive the car out of the porch as the automatic gate was partially closed
5105342 that is why we are often sidelined and considered to be outcasts
5105343 some of us at kampung laban now have mykad some the imm 13 temporary travel passes issued to filipino refugees and the rest a special permit from the state government which states who we are
5105344 there are also those who are without any documents but we try to explain our identity to the authorities and they understand
5105345 i no longer live in a boat i worked for a fishing company in sandakan when i was young and it was then that i decided to change my lifestyle
5105346 there are many bad people there who steal our things
5105347 we came here to see how good the fishing grounds were
5105348 when the police came to check i went into hiding i could hear many boats leaving the island that night
5105349 in our records there are basic profiles of some 5 000 from the community
5105350 we had at least 80 firemen battling the fire at the scene we were also assisted by the pasir gudang emergency action team
5105351 they were all evacuated the weather was fine there was no lightning or rain before the tanks caught fire
5105352 the state government has a special allocation for disasters like storms floods fires and the like and we will help those affected
5105353 we want to make learning science and technology fun and interesting by using a hands on approach
5105354 these sentiments are still lurking and both barisan nasional and pakatan rakyat are guilty of stirring these communal feelings
5105355 a clear example will be the protests against the bar council it almost turned violent because political groups used religious sentiments to rile the emotions of protesters
5105356 they must understand that the political landscape has changed as evident in the results of the last general election it is best that all parties respect the concept of multiculturalism of the country
5105357 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
5105358 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that have such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
5105359 i must be very honest with myself it is one thing to say i am capable and quite another for the grassroots to overcome the gender angle some of them have told me they have no problem with my capabilities but have a little problem that i am a woman
5105360 i give her all my blessings she is one of many groomed to take over the leadership of wanita mca
5105361 the centre with its special hardware and software will give collective access to this group of people who have been under served or marginalised in the ict revolution
5105362 it is especially so for the blind computer hardware and software for the blind and those with impaired hearing are expensive and beyond the reach of most of them
5105363 so this centre would give them the opportunity to access the wired world
5105364 it is part of the drive to close the digital divide in this case between the served and the under served
5105365 iedere nederlander wordt geacht de wet te kennen maar de belangrijkste wet in ons land de grondwet is voor de gewone burger niet te lezen laat staan te begrijpen
5105366 it is our duty to realise the aspirations of the people to bring about justice through islam especially in the states that we rule
5105367 for that the party must have an agenda to implement islamic laws one that is achievable and accepted by all malaysians
5105368 we have strong plans to turn this club into part of the partys official set up perhaps as another wing
5105369 representatives from the three parties will meet soon to discuss it
5105370 this incident will give other countries a bad impression of the democracy and freedom of press in malaysia the police must find the culprits they must be brought to court and face punishment
5105371 we suspect that this is a directive from party leaders every time there are pkr functions this happens
5105372 dont try to scoop the others by working alone if anything happens when you are working in a group at least they can help you and be your witnesses
5105373 it only reflects immaturity and lack of common decency on the part of the assailants
5105374 if we agree that politics is about defending ordinary people then the embarrassing incident on saturday demonstrated that this group is not fit to champion the rakyats cause
5105375 look after your own safety while covering the by election i sympathise with the two photographers who were set upon by several opposition supporters
5105376 i chose to smile at the jeers and profanities not because they did the right thing but rather because i was to a certain extent amused by the unreserved revelation of their crude if not uncivilised political culture and norms
5105377 they flashed me some malaysian ringgit bills while hurling verbal abuse which implied that the bn is corrupt this is meaningless to me the mastermind who orchestrated the ugly show should have done some homework as i dont have such a track record
5105378 my mca comrades were surprised that i could tolerate such nonsensical abuse to me sometimes it may be good to treat such nonsense with the disdain it deserves
5105379 the by election is not a battle arena but rather a place for voters to elect their representative
5105380 we need to give the people a chance to make their decision in an atmosphere of peace
5105381 now it is only implementing the islamic agenda half heartedly
5105382 those who only accept part of quranic injunctions are worshippers of devil not that of the almighty god
5105383 as i see it umno is lost it seems to be following the path of the devil by not subscribing to the full teachings of islam pas will only have muzakarah with umno if the party accepts islamic teachings in full
5105384 the only way out for umno is to accept and embrace the quranic injunctions in totality
5105385 that is the question we want umno to answer why cant the party accept the islamic struggle as stated in the quran and sunnah
5105386 even if umno is not around the rights of malay muslims will be safeguarded i am in pas and i am a malay has it made any difference to me because i am not an umno member
5105387 we struggled a bit in the second half but we managed to keep our lead
5105388 we were solid defensively but the most important thing is to win games
5105389 por favor contenha se ao bater nos traseiros das pessoas
5105390 n o tire seus sapatos por favor seus p s t m um cheiro forte
5105391 am i being realistic are my thoughts misleading me am i taking into account other possibilities
5105392 free access to the internet for everybody plus power of the soviets is communism
5105393 quer amos dar una imagen perfecta y pensamos en lo que ser a mejor para la naci n
5105394 era una cuesti n de inter s nacional la ni a ten a que aparecer ante las c maras deb a ser expresiva
5105395 lin miaoke es excelente para todo eso pero en cuanto a la voz yang peiyi es perfecta todo el equipo estaba de acuerdo
5105396 nos dijeron que hab a un problema y que hab a que resolverlo lo resolvimos
5105397 es insultar a la verdadera cantante y a la gente que le escuch
5105398 haz lo que tengas que hacer porque te encanta y en un futuro sino llegan los miles de discos vendidos y la fama por lo menos dir s que siempre hiciste algo que te gusta
5105399 nunca pens que cualquier cosa que haya hecho no es m s que un xito simplemente por que yo lo hice si yo y otras personas nos pusimos a tocar m sica eso ya fue un xito incre ble si escrib una canci n eso tambi n nunca cre que habr a una meta y si llegaba a alguna eso ya era un xito he tenido xito desde el principio todos lo pueden hacer todos tenemos ilusiones
5105400 rusia ha regresado con la vieja historia de la guerra fr a cuando el poder militar pod a hacer cuanto quisiera para aplastar la democracia
5105401 piden que las fuerzas rusas se retiren como un gesto de buena voluntad pero esto se hace para garantizar la sobrevivencia de los ciudadanos de osetia del sur
5105402 gewoon goede optredens niet echt hoogtepunten op een paar na en vooral sigur ros die alles goed maakte eigenlijk en er dus al bij al toch nog een superdagje van maakte
5105403 what you think im lying about the mirrors getting inside my brain you think im fucking crazy
5105404 we are talking about an island that is the same size as hong kong island where we want to add things such as an airport so ultimately we are certainly looking at several billions
5105405 we already have some bookings and its mainly from people under 50 who are preparing their retirement plans
5105406 thailand has shown how you can develop beautiful beaches but we also want to avoid some of the mistakes there and certainly want to remain upmarket
5105407 oh im just calling my husband hes coming over to have lunch with me
5105408 i cant wait to pay bills choose health insurance plans and clean up my books
5105409 we do need to change the culture to ensure the system remains effective and efficient if it is to survive
5105410 certainly there is a culture of overtime in correctional centres and an expectation that it will be provided as a right rather than as a privilege
5105411 high levels of overtime can obviously impact not only on performance of work but also on the work life balance
5105412 when persons are working very lengthy periods of overtime obviously there is a threat to their health and safety but also to those who they interact with
5105413 its no use trying to deal with a system that is growing by putting on part time and casual people temporary people
5105414 you put on permanent people who can learn under the experienced officers that know the job you dont fix it up by casuals and part timers
5105415 as i said earlier i believe we do need to put in steps so that weve got more staff and so that officers dont have to work massive amounts of overtime just to keep the department going
5105416 i was the first you know for me the wheel of death has spun many times so much time has passed i have a lot of catching up to do
5105417 sd2 teron gorefiend bug caster and target are not in the same map

5105419 sd2 teron gorefiend bug caster and target are not in the same map
5105420 its history in the making and i feel really honored to be a part of it
5105421 im going to certainly guard this with my life until the 28th
5105422 were discouraging scalpers any way we can monitoring common vending sites online and well be deactivating tickets that show up online
5105423 is arguably the most significant announcement in the camera market this year
5105424 id like to ask bubba to help take up the offering
5105425 it aint never been in a hole it couldnt get out of
5105426 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5105427 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5105428 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5105429 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5105430 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5105431 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5105432 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5105433 buying records is like voting if we all did it different people would be on top
5105434 xbox 360 has been an important partner in our efforts to offer consumers more ways to experience our artists music and this is especially true among gamers who are some of the most passionate music fans with this agreement we can take advantage of microsofts music platform and provide gamers what they want music videos from their favorite artists that can be downloaded quickly and easily
5105435 weve expanded on the strength of our gaming platform with new entertainment experiences
5105436 were excited to offer wmg music videos to our 12 million members around the world as we continue to evolve our music presence
5105437 it was important for jumpgate evolution to have the right partner in russia
5105438 we selected gfi due to their expertise and in depth knowledge of the russian market we are very excited to be launching this incredible title with them and have every confidence they will make it a huge success
5105439 we are very excited to begin working with one of the top developers and publishers of online gaming content in the world signing this licensing deal is the next step in securing our position as a professional market player across the region i am sure that this is the start of a long term partnership between both companies and we look forward to working closely with codemasters online and netdevil on this incredible next generation mmo
5105440 its been submitted as a request to the engineers and cant be handled
5105441 to make sure there are no safety issues or concerns
5105442 we identified areas likely to be most responsive to changes in greenhouse gas emissions this study provides information at the state scale as opposed to a global or regional average which could be useful for climate change policy
5105443 we see the same hotspot patterns even at lower greenhouse gas concentrations this suggests that we may be able to see these hotspots emerging already
5105444 he was always polite a good boxer a good friend
5105445 as a good person who was with the wrong crowd at the wrong time we will never see him again until we go to heaven
5105446 as the originators and organisers of dare to be digital abertay university is extremely proud to be working with all the sponsors and supporters of dare in promoting the talents skills and creativity that contribute directly to the success of the computer games sector both in scotland and across the uk and ireland
5105447 its success is demonstrated by the very high proportion of previous contestants who have been hired by a whole range of companies such as electronic arts rare denki realtime worlds and lionhead others have even set up their own games development companies and during this years contest we were delighted to note the first commercial launch of a game developed in dare to be digital
5105448 the scottish government is delighted to provide support of 56 800 to dare to be digital which brings the worlds leading games design competition to scotland showcasing our top class academic institutions and successful games industry through fresh talent we are committed to attracting and retaining talented international students and dare provides a great opportunity for these cutting edge experts to see the benefits of studying and living in scotland
5105449 im delighted to see young scots competing at an international level and collaborating with students from around the world dare to be digital demonstrates the excellent learning environment that scotland offers to the growing number of international students choosing to come and study in dundee and throughout scotland
5105450 as chairman of the judging panel it is my pleasure to relay that the panel of game industry experts felt the overall standard of this years entries exceeded all their expectation both in terms of breadth of subject matter and overall game quality
5105451 in a climate of spiralling costs and product slippages dare consistently manages to highlight what is achievable by the best new talent looking to enter the games business in just 10 weeks
5105452 it means take your drink up to your face to drink it
5105453 kmail wont retrieve e mail it doesnt respond to the request in any manner
5105454 were ready to get back in to church when its fixed i dont know when thats going to be but i cant wait for it
5105455 we need to do whats best for our parish and thats probably a bigger church
5105456 when st cecilia started way back in 1933 there were around probably 200 parishioners but today we are around 2 000 registered families
5105457 its not the building that comprises the church its the people
5105458 if i get them all together all my friends will be friends with each other if one of them objects to the other than the former is hitler
5105459 anime cons are that one friend that everybody takes advantage of
5105460 what do you think name of anime convention that you didnt attend was like
5105461 im sure my dear watson though i am states away from that location that it was sexually awkward
5105462 oh manchild he knows not what he does its the aspergers you know
5105463 they explained that it came down from the side over there but the only thing i heard before that was the train go by so i thought it was from the train
5105464 thats what caused the dam to become overtopped and breached
5105465 at the same time you are my enemy we really dont accept this kind of logic
5105466 destroys any possibility of any appearance of legitimacy and fairness
5105467 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5105468 if we would have preemptively worked with russia with georgia making sure that nato had the kind of ability and the presence and the engagement we could have perhaps avoided this
5105469 what weve done is focused so much on iraq that a lot of these other issues have slipped theyve not had the priority they deserve theyve not had the kind of attention that an obama administration would provide
5105470 theyve got to show that they can be responsible citizens again
5105471 its kind of our main thing because this country is really missing out on how it can be used positively for everyone
5105472 every single patient i know will not be in compliance with the 60 day rule its not going to work its driven by law enforcement not science
5105473 the government must store copies of the documents and we will demand that it make them open to the public by presenting the government with the duplicates of the released documents
5105474 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5105475 from tomorrow russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers
5105476 diaries for the past couple years so like a lot of people i felt like i knew him a little
5105477 ban or restrict imports exports or passthrough shipments for reasons of health safety environmental concerns national security or foreign affairs
5105478 neither of them wants to be too close to the u s nor too distant from iran
5105479 despite the widespread enthusiasm about the 2008 presidential election connecticut residents are not optimistic about what it portends for an economic recovery
5105480 up to now there has been just a very light off and on rainfall so much so that last night the people continued celebrating carnival
5105481 the iphone has severe limitations when it comes to effortless typing
5105482 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5105483 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5105484 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5105485 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5105486 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5105487 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
5105488 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5105489 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
5105490 when you hear about these shootings the reports always start out with this is a sleepy little place nobody thought this would ever happen here
5105491 over the next two or three quarters we expect uk gdp growth to be slightly negative or zero satisfying the conditions of technical recession
5105492 but the bigger danger of a major uk recession can and must be prevented
5105493 our central scenario envisages that uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 in the fourth quarter of 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 5 in the first quarter of 2009
5105494 but if the bank of englands monetary policy committee decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse
5105495 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months
5105496 a very sharp deceleration in consumer spending growth in reaction to falling house prices and the acute squeeze on household disposable incomes
5105497 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5105498 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5105499 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5105500 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5105501 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5105502 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5105503 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5105504 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5105505 despite request mccain resorted to stock answers at faith forum
5105506 were sending 700 billion dollars a year to countries that dont like us very much that some of that money is ended up in the hands of terrorists organizations
5105507 this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts are two of my most recent favorites by the way
5105508 i want to look you in the eye and assure you that i have supported justice alito and justice roberts i will nominate only judges who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and do not believe in legislating from the bench
5105509 many of which his audience seemed to have never heard before
5105510 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
5105511 they really are just trying to sell newspapers with sensationalism because nobody with a brain can be stupid enough to believe what they have written
5105512 its better to have a large crew on scene to do the investigation in a timely manner
5105513 intensive technical work to value engineer the cost of the building
5105514 if it were built as envisaged it could be about 80 90m over
5105515 this is speculation were going through standard design processes on the media centre as we have with all venues it has always been the intention that there would be some temporary elements and the exact nature of this is currently being finalised
5105516 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
5105517 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5105518 every effort by sags negotiators to reopen these talks to fundamentally alter the new media terms and make unreasonable economic demands has been flatly and consistently rejected by the producers at every level of these talks
5105519 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 2008 and no meetings formal or informal are scheduled the undisputed fact is that until sags negotiators make a deal their members will work indefinitely under an expired contract enjoying none of the pay increases protections or new media residuals that all of the other guilds are receiving
5105520 as the amptp knows and as we have reported to our members on several occasions substantive discussions about contract issues have occurred with ceos amptp committee members and staff on a continuing basis since the last formal meeting of the full committees the details of those discussions are confidential any suggestion that this is not the case is intentional misdirection and completely false
5105521 ive been in some finals but it felt really good to win my eighth title things seem to be going in the right direction to be honest i expected a much more difficult match
5105522 i felt like i was so well prepared and i was ready to stay on the court for a long time
5105523 it wasnt my best match of the week but you have to give credit to nadia
5105524 she served really well she kept it deep and i was always under pressure my serve wasnt that good and she has one of the best on the tour so there was a huge gap she was very aggressive
5105525 i knew i had to do something i just couldnt

5105531 it could be a fun and challenging way for me to test myself and youd have the honor of seeing yourself credited with the idea in the post drew cusumano august 17 2008 08 31 pm
5105532 its going to be that way for the rest of the season gm jon daniels said hank blalock was too sore to make the throws from third to first hell go to frisco tomorrow for a three game or so rehab and then could join the club on friday at first base

5105540 did god create them up in heaven and when finished move his hand down to earth and drop them off
5105541 if i was always told that god lived in the heavens and heaven was above our heads while the devil lived in hell deep below how come we dont see either when we rocket to the moon or dig deep into the ground
5105542 its clear to me that i committed a rash and thoughtless deed so on the 14th i withdrew

5105553 what i am proud of is the performance of the new zealand team three medals for rowing is just fantastic the platform was set and they performed but i dont take any credit for that i didnt expect any less from them
5105554 all the italian boats were faster than the new zealand boats

5105570 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5105571 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5105618 i am not a feminist i dont think women are better than men
5105619 dont try to us with your sorcerers ways lord vader your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you up the lost data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to see the location of the hidden rebel base
5105620 who knew for this reason i think i will be cremated
5105621 you and me girlfriend were going to bitch slap the key right out of the slayer and then boom
5105622 its not my fault im sorry glory but your plan is fundamentally flawed and putting it into action will be fatal for everyone involved
5105623 you do realize glory that the slayer hates us both
5105624 shes not going to tell you anything shed rather die and even before you say it no thats not any good if you dont know where the key is first
5105625 so she knows that were not really going to kill her but the obvious alternative to that torture her friends is also a loser plan
5105626 and all of her little friends will come together and redouble their efforts to defeat us if we kill one of them and they have good luck
5105627 i suggest we destroy her from the ground up when she doesnt care what the key does shell give it to you
5105628 kill them all of them in front of her if possible leave them as present on the living room floor suck the sanity right out her watcher burn her house to the ground and crucify her mother in the ashes call the cops on her when shes out slaying
5105629 youve got a serious revenge thing going on with the whole world
5105630 we understand what she wants and then we take it from her
5105631 what if something goes wrong when we take it what if she doesnt play ball
5105632 then we tie up the slayer and start cutting off fingers then toes then ears and so forth
5105633 you are so sick i love it youre the best underling ever
5105634 you are full of your own agenda but its not anything i can figure out what do you want really
5105635 i want everyone to feel just as bad as i did the night i decided to die
5105636 but right now i need to go gather information about the slayer is it all right if i leave for a while
5105637 please just listen i cant hear you anyway i dont want to hear you father i have sinned i my god where to begin i sold my soul and more than that i dont care i dont want to be forgiven i just want to be heard everything that i did i chose to do and im glad i decided to let that woman kill me in the park and i was glad are you trying to move
5105638 i was glad when i felt my heart almost stop i wanted to die i didnt realize that i would come back i didnt realize how much i hated everything about my life i hated myself and when i died i realized the truth about myself i was miserable and nobody cared everyone who cared the world took from me at least job had someone to tell him that he should curse god and die
5105639 bless me father because when i realized that the world hated me and that god hated me and that every good thing i had done had led to my death i gave in to all the things i had ever dreamt of doing and i liked it i still like it i have killed i have ravaged i have maimed i have lied and cheated and hurt every living thing i could managed to hurt it feels good i think i have a death wish father i think i always had one
5105640 father i want to die but i want a glorious death i dont think i can die until i have it
5105641 then i can die and go to hell forever but at least ill have the truth with me when i do
5105642 and i certainly dont need you spreading stories and so goodnight
5105643 this is not nam this is bowling there are rules
5105644 okay so oz freaked out and couldnt control the wolf within then he left you met tara and you and tara got together but oz comes back wolf tamed and you have to break the bad news

5105649 cordelia explain to me again why you had to drive to sunnydale alone
5105650 because only a crazy woman would try to kill a seer who was protected by the slayer her watcher and a coven of powerful witches
5105651 but only if your precious slayer puts down the weapon and puts her hands where i can see em
5105652 grand mack daddy hella number one straight out of hell vision
5105653 god may still want me but i dont want him
5105654 that woman that vampire is going to stop the world
5105655 well when youre not busy bleeding we need to talk about your vampire girlfriend
5105656 he had a vision of this little warrior woman the viragello
5105657 cuz basically the story boils down to the viragello gaining the key and making a choice whether to obliterate our universe or not the fun part is that according to the prophecy nobody can stop that from happening
5105658 what kind of a name is viragello anyway it sounds like an italian cheese vendor
5105659 she shot the crossbow out of buffys head and then shot giles in the shoulder with a firearm without breaking a sweat
5105660 look if the vamp dana or scully or the viragello or whatever her name is is after the key we are on it now not tomorrow now got it
5105661 i started seeing my druggie boyftriend when i was 9
5105662 ap make the modifications as needed and put the modified line back into register
5105663 i was thinking of changing my name to donna but donna sounds too much like my aunt
5105664 i wish that i could choose a p name then id pick a name off charmed but no it has to be a d
5105665 what the hell do you want to change your name for anyway
5105666 i mean harmonys a stupid name and all but like you say theres only so many good names that start with d
5105667 if you werent so busy stalking the slayer maybe you might hear a few things
5105668 and if you werent so busy flapping your jaws i could hear them
5105669 be a darling harm and tell me what the hell is going on
5105670 theyre really super cool and so powerful and theyre going to kill the slayer
5105671 and why are the vampirettes going to succeed when the master himself failed
5105672 i dont know all i know is that i was talking to big benny and he said that one of these vamps was made by the master but that shes not even the most powerful one and the most powerful one is like five foot two and out of her mind he says he saw her tear a guy open behind the bronze everyone is totally joining up with them
5105673 um big benny um a lot of people anyone whos anyone in the vampire community
5105674 can we go meet with them please big benny says that tonights vampire night at the bronze and i just really really want to go but everyones still mad at me for that whole minion thing i need protection
5105675 this is so cool were on a date with other vamps around oh spikey isnt it great
5105676 a tender young morsel from the looks of it i bet you went down real smooth and easy for your sire or do you remember
5105677 in the alley out back is a boy waiting for me to come out and finish him off hes seventeen years old one of those water polo boys completely made up of lean muscle and sweet pure young blood thats gone before you have time to savor it like a fine wine or a box of godiva chocolate
5105678 you can see it in your head cant you how it was he thought i was too old for him but he was excited he kept stumbling all the way out if he was a girl he would have giggled
5105679 you remember the way it feels how they moan and whimper and rub up against you
5105680 how they start to pant they can feel your unnaturalness pressed up next to them and the death staring them right in the face it makes them so hot and sweet though you know what i mean dont you he was still pumping his tight little hips against mine even though i had him pinned up against a cold brick wall sucking the blood out of his body until he was dizzy
5105681 i hate the name though im thinking of changing it maybe to rogue or vampirella
5105682 not really i guess dana works for now doesnt it
5105683 its not the ritz for damn sure but this is just temporary anyway
5105684 but what if oh what if i could make it so that nasty nasty chip went away what if you could bend over that luscious hot creature over there and eat her up just like the big bad wolf
5105685 why dont you ask little sister here where she got her m d its got to be better than being a bigger eunuch than angelus angelus has at least tasted human blood this year
5105686 im alive and dana can get the chip out your skull bloody boy scary isnt it you might have to decide to be a real man again
5105687 isnt she just lovely spike my own special little girl she helped me remake our family and she can get all the nasty nasty demons in your head out

5105692 even the work i did on my pda was a way of filling the void with some form of electronic activity
5105693 moments of spare time are steadily filled in by constant communication
5105694 recreate 68 is israeli tomer alias former idf soldier and paid mercenary working in georgia said

5105698 god dont you just hate size 8 people i mean id haaate to be size 8 they look disgusting once i was very nearly but thats because i was going through an eating disorder and i looked hideous
5105699 maybe mama can become a cooker when she gets done making lots and lots of scrapbook pages
5105700 the 15 years is going to dong it on the head
5105701 you cant just put that thing up and running tomorrow it would take a few years so i cant believe it
5105702 connor was a member of a loving family he was known to the police but not for anything serious as of yet there is no motive but it is very early days
5105703 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5105704 you cant buy a citi golf and expect it to run like a mercedes
5105705 when i am king you will be first against the wall
5105706 you had to go and fall for a slayer didnt you
5105707 it wasnt enough that you two broke up you had to go all mushy for that cheerleader
5105708 that was so cool how did you keep him alive while you did it
5105709 hey i didnt sire her i just slept with her
5105710 do you think the slayer will come looking for you its such a pain to have to go search her out
5105711 shes not that hard to find its not like youre looking for j d salinger
5105712 tilt it this way come on for old times sake i gotta keep up with this new storyline
5105713 yeah im still thinking its a bad idea that doesnt mean no
5105714 its just that if the government blokes that put it in cant get it out whats the guarantee that you can
5105715 i was government number one and if i can autopsy goat sucking chupacabra and green slime aliens that kill you upon inhalation i can sure as hell get one teensy little chip out of your head
5105716 jesus did every last single one of you crazy fuckers know who i was before i died
5105717 can i get a little pint of that blood youre sampling im peckish
5105718 sorry no can do blood is for vampires not for slayer whipped eunuchs
5105719 hey i didnt ask for this bloody chip in my skull
5105720 youre not asking for me to get rid of it either
5105721 sit and spin spike im not interested in hearing you complain
5105722 shut up harmony or i will crush your larynx got it
5105723 spike youve made little sister all angry she doesnt like being told no it makes her go all homicidal maniac
5105724 why the fuck do you let her order you around anyway
5105725 you were afraid of her when she was a mortal now she has absolutely nothing to lose i dont know spike id place her against the slayer any day shes got a purpose its like angelus was back in the day it didnt make any sense to follow him around but i knew it was the best way to thrive in this world of ignorant impotent humans
5105726 i see it i see it in my head and im afraid the world is going to stop its spinning and spinning and oh my poor darling girl
5105727 it was drenched in blood and glory but then it stopped cold she made it stop why wasnt it good enough for her when she has all the world in her fist why why why
5105728 i thought you were for the end of the world dru
5105729 do we really want him hindering our fun you said he was slayer whipped anyway he might not get much fun out of tearing her beating heart from her body
5105730 was a killjoy my life was to pretend that every shadow was a shadow that every monster was a psychological manifestation of the collective unconscious and that being in love with the wrong man was a sin
5105731 youre the newbie here you dont even have as much history with us as harmony and yet youre in charge giving orders knowing history this and that i dont like tyrants
5105732 im not a tyrant arent i asking you to have the chip removed
5105733 and i give orders because im the one who knows whats happening
5105734 im glory and youre the viragello nice threads are those dkny

5105736 i could kill all of your flunkies in less time than it takes to say goodbye
5105737 but what does brute strength have to do with leadership and why do you want me as an ally
5105738 ive been trapped on this world by a cruel cruel fate and im tired of it im tired of this petty existence full of silly stupid humans i want to be free of it all but i need your help to do it
5105739 youre tired of the world well so everyone is tired of the world
5105740 you have to help me or ill kill everyone here
5105741 unless you give me a good reason to help you im not going to do it
5105742 mean horrible vampire i am glorificus i am she who cannot be named
5105743 you really shouldnt insult her she is older than time in fact she could probably obliterate us in a second
5105744 you dont know what its cost me to beg a foul diseased creature a near human to help me find the key and open the way to my home all i want is to go home cant you help me im begging here me queen among demons me im begging you a mere vampire to do this please
5105745 home hmm what would you do if you went home

5105754 we want him to defend himself not just dump us and leave once and for all he should answer all those questions
5105755 we want political stability and the governments focus should be on the peoples betterment
5105756 i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5105757 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
5105758 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the line
5105759 hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him
5105760 a lot of people are of the belief that you have to be short strong and stocky to be a great sprinter and usain bolt has defied that he has shown that hes a 6ft 5in sprinter and can run well and break world records he has great starts and its the beginning of something else
5105761 i am definitely not going to say hes the epitome of the sprinter because theres too many different kinds of sprinters that ive admired over the years but the way he drives and his pattern the way it goes together his amazing first 40 metres i give it to him
5105762 i woke up around eleven i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track
5105763 i think that a guy who can make plays and handle the ball takes a lot of pressure off me handling the ball a whole lot im more than comfortable playing off the ball thats one of my strengths and i really get to use that strength now im very excited about that
5105764 the way i play and the gifts that i have is better suited to cleveland me playing with a facilitator really grows my game in milwaukee they were looking for something different they were looking for a distributor that didnt play to my strength it took away from my aggressiveness
5105765 you cant take 16 years away no thats brett favre sorry
5105766 all joking aside you cant take those four years away i know they put me in a situation with my contract and an opportunity to play
5105767 i dont want to get into cleveland is a better situation than milwaukee
5105768 i dont want to sound like im bashing milwaukee because im not
5105769 its just two different situations two different styles of play i think the way i play and the gift i have is better suited with cleveland me playing with a facilitator it really grows my game in milwaukee they were looking for something different kind of a distributor
5105770 that really didnt play to my strengths because it took away from my aggressiveness they were going into a direction where they were going to change their culture they had coach scott skiles coming in and john hammond i think this came about and it worked out for both parties we can leave it at that
5105771 they didnt trade me to one of the worst places in the world
5105772 i really loved the city of milwaukee ive got season tickets to the brewers but if youre going to play with arguably the best player in america you really cant be disappointed about it
5105773 mo williams is a very good combo guard a very good point guard to set things up for us it should be fun
5105774 mos quickness is something we havent had since ive been here
5105775 not only end to end but in the halfcourt with mo pushing the ball in transition hell even get that ball up the floor on the pass we think mo will bring a dimension of adding easy baskets for us
5105776 i think playing with lebron hes someone who can help push the tempo a little bit and help lebron and other guys get easier baskets
5105777 i like him i think hes a competitive player who can make big shots and one of those guys capable of rising to important times
5105778 i can relieve him from that and it will help him be a little fresher at the end of the season as far as helping me a guy that can make plays and handle the ball takes a lot of pressure off me
5105779 youve got to want to do it youve got to have the mentality to do it ive got away from that the last few years for whatever reason we can go on and on for the reasons
5105780 im excited about the opportunity and i reiterate i know what it takes to win theres no secret it takes defense
5105781 im excited about the opportunity to come in and get back to my defensive plays that i grew up seeing and doing
5105782 it has been kind of different the last few years for me in terms of defense

5105787 but he was also my best defensive player he always took our opponents best offensive guard
5105788 mos quickness is something we havent had here since ive been here his ability to turn the ball or to work the ball three quarter court or full court at times is something that will only help our defense im excited about what mo can possibly bring to the table for us on the defensive end of the floor
5105789 i think that should be seen as a positive as for j j we like the foundation with us that hes created this summer he has worked very hard he has shown his talent level hes willing to get in the gym and work on his game we need to help him continue to develop and improve

5105890 because i believe that despite its deficiencies it is still able at its best to articulate that sense of the ineffable and essential which gives meaning purpose and definition to our lives both as individuals and as the social creatures who owe it to ourselves to look after one another and the planet that succours and shelters us far from perfect challenged on all sides by indifference weighed down as it is with the burden of its own considerable limitations it may yet point towards a context where human beings may be freer more complete and more fully appraised of the mystery which is at the heart of all mysteries from which we emerge and to which in the end we return the theology which i am looking for and to which i have tried tentatively to point in this book will be the sensitive language of a christian community that is outward looking self effacing and non dogmatic it will begin from experience conduct a process of exchange with the world and critique the mastery of institutions and the top down pronouncements of church hierarchies as well as the superficialities of life in the postmodern zone it will serve as the codex for a federation of fellow travelers on lifes way those travelers are oriented towards their brothers and sisters in a spirit of hope and engage with their siblings anxiety and despondency but they know that like the trio of seekers on the threshold of tarkovskys room there is finally a place which goes beyond words or creeds or doctrine it is offered to us the wretched and sometimes the despairing miraculously in the form of grace and by it we are transformed
5105891 theology is generally perceived by outsiders to be tedious irrelevant and anachronistic and that these characteristics are related to the comprehensive marginalisation of christianity and the church at every level of our culture theology and church are as disconnected from one another as are church and society and the consequence is that self orientation self gratification and unfettered globalisation and consumption surge forward unchecked in our world profoundly destructive at global community and individual levels alike

5105970 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5105971 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5105972 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5105973 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5105974 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells

5106015 sorry wim yes i am italian can you tell me when you will join us thank you for being so not italian
5106016 no supimos trabajar el partido obviamente si perdimos fue por nuestra culpa pero yo la verdad que no culp nunca a los rbitros pero el de hoy fue muy rigorista la expulsi n no ten a por que ser y s sentimos el arbitraje un poco en contra pero la derrota fue nuestra culpa despu s de la expulsi n no supimos c mo pararnos y ellos inteligentemente tuvieron la pelota y se nos vinieron encima
5106017 empezamos bien fuertes y bien parados yo creo que lo que falt fue modificar en el momento exacto y simplemente la expulsi n nos ech atr s y nos afect mucho
5106018 vamos bien la semana pasada est bamos invictos y nadie nos dec a nada hoy perdimos de visita pero de locales somos muy fuertes y esperamos que morelia la pague
5106019 contento tambi n ah en lo individual mientras sea para sumar y positivo pues es bienvenido sin quitarle importancia tambi n al centro que pone amaury ponce
5106020 s importante por lo que significaba no nos pod amos dar el lujo de seguir perdiendo porque las cosas empezaban a apretarse bastante si bien no hab amos hecho las cosas tan mal en lo num rico que es lo que importa no reflej bamos y lo importante hoy era ganar o ganar
5106021 lo que pasa es que seguimos recibiendo goles muy temprano goles apretados pero que al cabo cuestan y cuentan nos ponen en complicaciones falta un poco de manejo de partido y recibimos muchas tarjetas
5106022 perdimos a pesar de que ten amos muchas ganas de sacar el resultado
5106023 si nos perjudic un poco sin embargo ustedes tienen la mejor opini n m s que nada en la expulsi n yo no s si ameritaba la roja no alcanzo a ver bien pero tampoco estuvimos bien parados
5106024 hoy jugamos diferente dejamos llegar mucho a toluca con bal n controlado y pr cticamente ellos se quedaron con el bal n fuera del rea y eso nos hizo mucho da o nunca supimos presionar adelante y nos cost el partido hay que analizar lo hecho platicar lo cierto es que perdimos a pesar de que ten amos muchas ganas de sacar el resultado
5106025 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank
5106026 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5106027 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge

5106030 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5106031 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5106032 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5106033 i see barack obama as kind of the thoughtful consensus builder i see john mccain as the happy straightforward warrior and they both answered exactly according to casting
5106034 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5106035 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5106036 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5106037 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5106038 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5106039 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5106040 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5106041 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5106042 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5106043 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5106044 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5106045 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5106046 one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5106047 es w re w nschenswert wenn die bahn bei der erstellung des prospekts sehr prominent auf das thema und die damit wom glich verbundenen risiken hinweist
5106048 there are great opportunities for a possible investment in this sector
5106049 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business
5106050 wait just a minute im the head not the tail im blessed not cursed i dont tolerate this situation i happen to be a child of the king himself he sets my table in the presence of my enemies no weapon formed against me can prosper
5106051 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5106052 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5106053 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5106054 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5106055 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person

5106060 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5106061 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5106062 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5106063 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5106064 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5106065 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5106066 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5106067 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5106068 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5106069 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5106070 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5106071 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states

5106073 this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire
5106074 small cap results have been clearly weaker than large cap both in terms of share price reaction and subsequent analyst earnings per share revisions
5106075 this appears to reflect greater sensitivity to the local and nz business cycle and the concentration of manufacturing businesses at the small cap end of the market
5106076 the results to date in numeric terms have not been hugely disappointing
5106077 they have shown the australian economy is not yet in the depths of any overly significant downturn
5106078 the companies themselves and some investors have some concerns about where the economy might be taking us in the next year
5106079 tighter financial conditions and softening domestic demand have been associated with a sharp slowing in credit expansion to both households and businesses
5106080 the latest indications of investment intentions are still relatively strong though some scaling back of existing plans should probably be expected given recent declines in confidence and softer household demand

5106119 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5106120 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5106121 this down swing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5106122 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5106123 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth
5106124 what we are witnessing in the crude oil market is the bursting of a fairly typical speculative bubble
5106125 let me tell you a thing about the arse muscle it has a mind of its own
5106126 instead of actual exercises there was a lot of keeping it tight my wife would put things in the crack and say hold on to this and walk around the room
5106127 i did that for an hour and forty minutes a day i had to do it every day and couldnt eat what i wanted either i hated it
5106128 creo que han estado m s atentos en el resultado que en el funcionamiento ha habido partidos que los hemos hecho muy buenos que el resultado no ha sido el favorable ahora se juntan los dos buen funcionamiento con un buen resultado pero creo que todav a podemos dar mucho m s tenemos cosas que corregir mejorar en mucho y tambi n resaltar las cosas que se vienen haciendo bien
5106129 vamos por buen camino que estamos insistiendo en una forma de jugar erradicar algunas cuestiones que traen de atr s y queremos jugar de otra forma a lo que estaban acostumbrados y que vamos poco a poco este resultado por supuesto le da confianza al grupo en que lo que estamos haciendo lo estamos haciendo bien
5106130 todos son importantes as se los he dicho cualquiera puede aparecer y el estar preparados es importante para poder darle una respuesta al grupo
5106131 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5106132 s necesitaba por lo menos tener 65 70 minutos que fue lo que tuve y a buen ritmo as que en lo personal muy feliz
5106133 creo que un triunfo muy necesitado y que cost un poco en el primer tiempo quiz porque no combatimos las situaciones r pido y el gol de ventaja de ellos pero creo que supimos manejarlo y tuvimos buen juego
5106134 s una tranquilidad para tener una semana larga de trabajo va a ser muy importante y era muy importante ganar hoy para encarar el partido de indios ganar de visitante y sacudirnos esa mala racha y sumar de a tres siempre
5106135 carlos esquivel es un jugador que a m me encanta y hoy recuperamos a sinha en el segundo tiempo as que de a poco todos nos vamos poniendo bien a mancilla lo conozco as que vamos bien
5106136 sin duda que tenemos obligaci n m s que nada porque estamos en casa y eso debemos aprovechar si no queremos tener problemas en la fase eliminatoria as que tenemos que sacar todos los puntos en casa sobre todo que este es el primer partido de la eliminatoria y ojal que podamos hacer un buen partido para ganar y sobre todo que nuestra gente salga contenta
5106137 no ser a la primera vez ni eriksson ser el primer t cnico que tenga poco tiempo de trabajo al mando de un equipo antes de preparar un partido al final de cuentas todos somos profesionales y tampoco somos nuevos en esto pues todos los que venimos tenemos que meternos en la cabeza que debemos ganar como sea independientemente del poco o mucho trabajo que tuvimos con el nuevo entrenador
5106138 claro que ser complicado al igual que como todos los visitantes honduras tratar de estar todo el tiempo atr s y esperar un poco el contragolpe lo cual debemos estar muy atentos en eso aunque tampoco debemos atacar a lo loco y tambi n esperar lo que quiere el t cnico sven en su primer partido simplemente esperamos un partido muy r spido sobre todo en la media cancha contra jugadores muy fuertes
5106139 el rival tiene el derecho en decir lo que quiera honduras ya nos gan en la copa oro hace un a o pr cticamente es por eso que nosotros venimos con la mentalidad de que no va a ser f cil y que vamos a pasar por encima del rival porque ser a enga ar a todos obviamente que queremos ganar por 4 0 pero al final la realidad es otra y ojal que podamos sacar un buen triunfo en casa que es lo nico que debemos pensar pues nosotros tambi n sentimos que tenemos nuestra mejor selecci n pero ya dentro de la cancha somos once contra once y los nombres se reflejan dentro de la cancha as que esperemos que podamos imponer nuestro estilo sobre ellos
5106140 no necesitamos que nos favorezcan pero s esperamos que sea parejo que es lo que se busca en un partido lo m s importante es que debemos ser inteligentes y no meternos en problemas con el rbitro
5106141 luego de enfrentar el juego contra honduras me reporto con mi equipo el d a 25 del presente para viajar a croacia donde jugar un partido de la uefa posteriormente el 31 nos enfrentaremos al real madrid en el inicio de la liga despu s regreso con la selecci n para los otros partidos correspondientes a la eliminatoria
5106142 vengo con la mentalidad de trabajar para ser titular aunque la competencia por el puesto es fuerte el t cnico es quien toma la ltima palabra as que durante estos d as trabaj fuerte para demostrar que tengo las condiciones suficientes para ese lugar
5106143 estamos mentalizados en ganar y aprovechar que estamos en casa lo menos que podemos pensar en estos momentos es en qu condiciones viene honduras s lo hay que demostrar un buen trabajo dentro la cancha
5106144 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5106145 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through and got a win but at six shots back i didnt think much about it
5106146 i just tried to play the best i could i honestly didnt expect to win at all but thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5106147 it probably will be overshadowed by the olympics especially with the aussies doing so well in swimming
5106148 sport is such a huge part of our culture i hope it gets coverage down there because we need to raise the profile of womens golf participation has actually been declining in the last five years the more aussies that do well the better the game is going to get
5106149 i just tried to forget about it there was lots of golf left
5106150 in golf there are no guarantees youre leading by seven strokes five strokes it doesnt matter she played well and i know she was expecting a great situation but shes 19 years old this will probably be a great experience for her
5106151 im sure the lead group felt more pressure than i did
5106152 but when you tee it up you dont know what will happen you cant control how anyone else is playing
5106153 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5106154 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5106155 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5106156 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already

5106164 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5106165 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5106166 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5106167 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system
5106168 we are calling on elected officials within the cma and governments to respond to the evidence and to the real needs of canadians and promote reforms within the public health care system
5106169 i didnt have a specialist at that time and so i was a bit in limbo
5106170 i think she took pity and sort of did it
5106171 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5106172 the evidence is absolutely clear that the extent of the benefits and the numbers of patients involved as such that it isnt the right decision for the health service to make treatment available until patients as they inevitably will move into the moderate stage of the disease
5106173 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5106174 a lot of people with early onset have got dependents both younger and older and theyre trying to hold down a job
5106175 it is a really nasty disease and i cannot imagine cancer patients being denied a drug like this in similar circumstances
5106176 if im not on the drug id find certain things difficult doing up buttons so you get a line of buttons in the shirt done up right can be a problem
5106177 in theory i should be that much worse but my wife has said that im better now than i was in the autumn

5106190 concern has always been the agencies access to content in an environment they can work in
5106191 the lack of integrated information imposes costs on agents both for separate search equipment and in the extra time required to perform the searches these costs will ultimately be reflected in service charges to consumers
5106192 its not exactly where we want to be but weve got a shot
5106193 a 6 4 road trip is a good trip but i just look at my two starts and we lost both of them

5106210 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
5106211 it is scorned worldwide afghanistan is backsliding the bar has been set low in iraq georgia is in ruins
5106212 this action is a real challenge to the idea of building a europe whole free and at peace
5106213 jeopardize these nascent democracies by letting them think that they can put themselves in this kind of situation and survive
5106214 you are not just putting democracy on the line in georgia you are putting all of these places in that neighborhood on the line
5106215 i have seen it over and over again be misconstrued by nations not used to dealing with us

5106248 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5106364 majority of consumers are calling it on a daily basis and asking for more hd digital programming
5106365 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5106366 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5106367 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5106368 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5106369 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5106370 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5106371 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5106372 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5106373 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5106374 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5106375 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5106376 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5106377 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5106378 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5106379 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5106380 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5106381 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5106382 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5106383 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5106384 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5106385 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5106386 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5106387 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5106388 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5106389 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5106390 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5106391 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5106392 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5106393 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5106394 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5106395 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5106396 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5106397 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5106398 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5106399 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5106400 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5106401 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5106406 the initial trial included six registries here in bathurst as well as campbelltown charlestown wollongong maitland and gosford and was aimed at introducing mainly regional motorists to a more convenient way of using sydneys motorways

5106409 the tags can be used on all motorways in new south wales victoria and queensland
5106410 i know ross thompson was also in discussion with other candidates about forming a ticket
5106411 this now sounds very much like sour grapes to me
5106412 six weeks ago i did speak with paul about the possibility of running a ticket
5106413 it is the timing of the ticket and not the fact that he is running one that is my concern
5106414 i knew tickets were a possibility but i dont see why they put them up at the 11th hour
5106415 they are great servants of bathurst but i think we are entitled to expect a little more openness from these two
5106416 i actually like both of them very much and theyve played within the letter of the law but i question whether theyve acted in the spirit of it
5106417 the thinking voter will number one to nine below the line
5106418 this issue doesnt need to be a major election topic
5106419 lets just get on with the job and have some fun
5106420 i have chosen a group of people i believe are the best for bathurst
5106421 it is a comprehensive report and the minister will need time to review it
5106422 we are confident mr martin has done everything that has been asked of him and he was part of a chain of command
5106423 as far as we are concerned he has followed all the guidelines and it has now been almost six months and we still havent been given an indication of what is in that report
5106424 we built the two carts over the past few months but only got out and did some practise on hills in the last few weeks
5106425 the derby has just been a super idea and it is good to see so many people here supporting it
5106426 yeah im a little bit nervous and excited at the same time
5106427 la brecha entre los docentes y los alumnos en lo que hace a las nuevas tecnolog as y los temas inform ticos sigue siendo grande los chicos saben m s que sus profesores y eso es un problema que se vive a diario en los colegios de la regi n
5106428 el problema por ah se da con los profesores que tienen varios a os dando clases apunta mana massi directora del normal n 1 de la plata los docentes j venes ya vienen con un bagaje en temas inform ticos que los coloca en otro lugar con respecto al alumnado pero es cierto que muchos docentes con varios a os de experiencia a veces les agarra una psicosis cuando comprenden que los chicos en ese terreno ya les sacaron varios cuerpos de ventaja
5106429 un doble desaf o pedag gico interesant simo porque por un lado se debe capacitar al docente y por el otro seguir formando a los alumnos para que vayan a la par de los avances tecnol gicos ahora se est n ultimando los detalles de un plan de alfabetizaci n digital financiado por el bid y que comenzar su etapa preparatoria durante el segundo semestre est claro que los docentes fueron formados con la matriz del libro como elemento central y los chicos en cambio con una cultura tecnol gica que les resulta absolutamente familiar por eso el desaf o es achicar esa brecha y acompa arla con la estructura necesaria para que no quede en palabras y nada m s
5106430 el docente sabe que ese es un gran d ficit sostiene massi por su parte en nuestro caso sabemos que los chicos incorporan conocimientos tecnol gicos de manera mucho m s acelerada que el cuerpo docente y tratamos de manejarlo con la incorporaci n de m s tecnolog a entendemos que es la mejor forma primero para que el chico pueda seguir ampliando esos conocimientos y segundo para que el profesor se siga capacitando en su tarea cotidiana
5106431 siguen siendo pocos los docentes que tienen un conocimiento cabal de computaci n o internet en general son los alumnos los que tienen que ense arles a sus maestros de qu se trata la cuesti n y es algo bastante l gico los chicos nacen en un mundo tecnol gico y eso hace que incorporen los nuevos conceptos de un modo natural y r pido mientras que los profesores tienen que afrontar el desaf o con varios a os sobre sus espaldas sin haber agarrado tal vez una computadora en toda su vida
5106432 tal vez pueda existir cierto prejuicio o temor ante los temas de la inform tica comenta piovani pero nuestra obligaci n es superarlos y darles a todos los docentes las herramientas necesarias para que puedan incluirse y crecer dentro del universo de la computaci n
5106433 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5106434 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5106435 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation

5106437 its based on local history and culture of river life
5106438 revealing a very gradual transformation of her character as she learns more about missouri river life and about the folks living along the river she is quite unlikable at first narrow minded and haughty but she learns in dramatic fashion to let go of her prejudices and accept her new river surroundings
5106439 vivian marks represents our resistance to change blind racism and the power of nature to transform
5106440 bringing down the house can make a different movie from the same source material whats the statute of limitations on remakes
5106441 dont let it end like this tell them i said something
5106442 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5106443 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5106444 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5106445 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5106446 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5106447 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5106448 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5106449 who are open to doing something on the production side
5106450 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5106451 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5106452 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5106453 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5106454 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5106455 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5106456 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5106457 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5106458 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5106459 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5106460 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5106461 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5106462 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5106463 were space pirates think of johnny depp as a romulan
5106464 having lived with it now and gotten to know the characters and worked with amazing actors who portrayed them it made me fall in love with that notion that idea that for some reason never struck me the way that twilight zone did
5106465 m ais sils se repentent accomplissent la salat et acquittent la zakat ils deviendront vos fr res en religion nous exposons intelligiblement les versets pour des gens qui savent

5106467 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5106468 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5106469 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5106470 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5106471 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5106472 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5106473 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5106474 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5106475 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5106476 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5106477 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5106478 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5106479 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5106480 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5106481 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5106482 sure and jeffery dommer was just a really nice guy
5106483 i knew i should have gotten a zune they cant kill me or do anything else
5106484 es casi un lugar com n con el que refregamos en la cara de nuestros chicos nuestra absoluta devoci n por ellos
5106485 no tengas miedo porque yo estoy con vos no te angusties que yo soy tu dios te doy fuerzas te ayudo te sostengo con mi diestra victoriosa

5106487 sientes un cubetazo de agua fr a creo que se est anunciando el principio de un fin no es un fin palpable osea que vaya a ser ma ana porque todav a falta un disco lo que ser la gira del adi s pero pues el simple hecho de anunciar que empieza la despedida obviamente te llenan de sentimiento y de por si yo soy un chavo como medio sentimental
5106488 lo que m s nos duele es perder llegar a perder ese momento de uni n yo creo que nos sent amos tambi n como protegidos porque al mismo tiempo al ser una familia yo por ejemplo que viv momentos dif ciles cada uno cuando ha vivido los momentos dif ciles creo que hemos sentido el apoyo de los dem s y es raro porque te acostumbras a estar en manada

5106492 broken bodies shattered minds torture and ill treatment of women
5106493 le plus souvent de membres de leur famille ou de leur communaut ou encore de leurs employeurs
5106494 condamner publiquement les violences inflig es aux femmes les interdire dans leur l gislation ouvrir une enqu te sur toute all gation de violences ainsi qu traduire en justice et sanctionner leurs auteurs
5106495 elle est enracin e dans une culture qui partout refuse aux femmes l galit des droits avec les hommes et tente de l gitimer la violence leur gard
5106496 les tortionnaires sont parfois des agents de letat ou des membres de groupes arm s mais il sagit le plus souvent de membres de leur famille ou de leur communaut ou encore de leurs employeurs pour un grand nombre de femmes le foyer est un lieu de terreur
5106497 aux termes du droit international les etats sont tenus dinterdire et de pr venir la torture et ils doivent prendre des mesures contre ces violences en toute circonstance or bien trop souvent loin de fournir une protection suffisante aux femmes les gouvernements se sont rendus complices de ces exactions les ont dissimul es et cautionn es ils ont laiss la situation se perp tuer
5106498 il est grand temps pour les gouvernements de reconna tre que la violence exerc e au foyer et dans la communaut nest pas une affaire priv e mais quelle met en jeu la responsabilit des etats les normes internationales indiquent clairement que les etats sont tenus de sassurer que nul nest soumis la torture ou dautres mauvais traitements quels que soient leur auteur ou leur contexte
5106499 en ne tenant pas compte de cette obligation ils partagent la responsabilit des souffrances quils nont pas emp ch es
5106500 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5106501 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5106502 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5106503 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5106504 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5106505 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5106506 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5106507 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5106508 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5106509 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5106510 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5106511 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5106512 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5106606 you saw two of the best pitchers ever out there randy pitched a great game too he just made one mistake
5106607 they were hitting it pretty well but i got them to hit it right at someone
5106608 i think randy was more focused because he was facing roy randy was pretty dominant and roy was real dominant
5106609 i mean any time that guy puts wood on it its a base hit right now
5106610 you kind of knew after the first two games to see that kind of a performance three times wouldve been a lot to ask for
5106611 id much rather have him pitching every five days than the other option
5106612 i have dreamed of being a hero of one of the games maybe winning the world series eventually but not such a great game all along
5106613 we just try to compete it gets a little emotional sometimes when i see him competing like that thats all i ask of him just give me your best
5106614 bad penalties hurt us i was talking to coach wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we overcame them a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
5106615 were putting ourselves in bad situations just a lot of little things are holding us back no one can overcome making a lot of mistakes we just need to start staying out of these situations
5106616 we had opportunities and we didnt take advantage of them
5106617 we moved the ball and then there was a penalty and that hurt us those kind of things hurt us but i think were going to be all right
5106618 we practiced with denver all week and we did well
5106619 they changed up their whole game plan that is good on their part
5106620 i threw the ball well today and had a good camp this week
5106621 they are coming a long a lot faster they are looking good right now
5106622 the older guys are trying to help them out a bit i try to help them out a little bit to bring them a long a little faster than a normal freshman would i try to tell them a little bit more everyday
5106623 i dont really know if i see them do something wrong i try to correct them before it becomes a bad habit because if it becomes a habit you will have a problem you try to correct it when it first happens
5106624 everyday at practice they are stepping up to the challenge they arent backing away from anybody
5106625 it isnt easy you know its just a part of playing football
5106626 we have some improving to do its early we got a little time but we just are working hard everyday trying to get better and better
5106627 ive gotten a lot stronger ive added about 70 pounds to my bench press from last year
5106628 yeah im trying to maintain a little bit trying to gain a little bit but not too much
5106629 yeah were coming a long real good i can read that defense sometimes he doesnt even have to make the call and i already know what i am supposed to do like double team or something we are really able to tell what the defense is going to do when we step up to the line
5106630 it really doesnt matter to me i feel a little more comfortable at guard because i played it all year last year tackle is a little different it really doesnt matter to me its football
5106631 well we are trying to feel like that with everybody now but yeah its a lot more comfortable next to him because he knows what to do and i know what to do but we are trying to make everybody like that
5106632 hes doing pretty good right now he is going to help us out a lot
5106633 yeah him along with all the other freshman because when i got here last year it was kind of hard to pick up everything they are picking it up real good joe and all the other freshman are coming along real good
5106634 yeah a little bit but he is still the same old coach trickett its better for all of us we go through practice or a game and dont even really get tired so it makes it easier for all of us
5106635 i dont really get into all of that you know we just try to block for whoever is back there if we block for them they can do it coach has the right plays for them
5106636 we are all working together we have to help the freshmen get ready we let them know before the play that they are doing pretty good and stuff like that
5106637 everyone is a lot smarter right now we are all playing a lot smarter
5106638 hes good he is fast got a good arm he is real good
5106639 yeah we have to improve this year we really have to work hard this year and improve
5106640 its just the motto we came up with just to take everything one day at a time we dont need to worry about whats going to happen in the future or what happened in the past we have to take it one day at a time
5106641 yeah sometimes he will let you know when you do good as well as with the bad you just cant hear that good job and slack off you got to keep doing it you have to be consistent you cant do it good this time then bad the next time you have to keep on consistently
5106642 yeah that is big that is the biggest thing for players that play for him if you try hard it will lead you in the right direction but consistency definitely be consistent
5106643 they have a lot of talent a lot of talent especially at the skill positions and we are working hard on the offensive line i feel like if we can block for the quarterback and give him the time this offense is going to click
5106644 yeah a little bit its kind of strange being a leader as a sophomore but were just coming out and playing football and helping everyone else out along the way
5106645 hes doing pretty good you know he just got here less than a week ago and he has come in and learned a lot faster than what a normal freshman probably would he has picked things up pretty good like i said he and the other freshmen are working hard and they are all picking it up pretty good
5106646 yeah i try to help him sometimes but he is still playing pretty good out there because he knows the concepts of the plays he knows the technique pretty well
5106647 well we are out there working really hard we are working a lot harder than last year especially this summer
5106648 well we havent really gotten to deep into camp yet like i said there has been a lot of competing out there so far thats the main thing you have to compete like you do in a game so in practice we are competing we have been competing a lot with one another
5106649 let us see you you beauties come by our boat we like you
5106650 follow along with me this is how its done properly
5106651 imagine if america had no system of post secondary education imagine if a bachelors degree ba equaled nothing what would we do according to author charles murray the solution is not to create better degrees but to have no degrees at all instead people should get certifications the merits of certifications like those earned by accountants that pass the cpa exam apply to any college major for which the ba is now used as a job qualification such as criminal justice social work and public administration says murray
5106652 we must ban which web site is against our rules with this way we can get succed and block them
5106653 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business
5106654 chaudhry is expected to explain to him why we have decided to call it a day
5106655 effectively engage with the population with respect to the draft peoples charter as well as prepare for the next general election
5106656 we decided to rip off the bad guys we were pirates we were good guys wearing black hats
5106657 there were contracts out on me all over i mean the mexican mob wanted me dead and the cops were closing in i mean it was kind of embarrassing we were making more arrests than they were they would find people walking around with handcuffs on them we also did stings as irs agents and just took their cash
5106658 they caught the culprits because i obviously couldnt be buying a mercedes and a condo in marina del rey at the same time im in prison
5106659 chaudhry is expected to explain to him why we have decided to call it a day
5106660 effectively engage with the population with respect to the draft peoples charter as well as prepare for the next general election

5106672 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5106673 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5106674 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5106675 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5106676 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5106677 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5106678 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5106679 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5106680 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5106681 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5106682 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5106683 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5106684 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5106685 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5106686 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5106687 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5106688 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5106689 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5106690 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5106691 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5106692 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5106693 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5106694 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5106695 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5106696 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5106697 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5106698 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5106699 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5106700 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5106701 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5106702 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5106703 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5106704 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5106705 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5106706 i guess its a lucky number for me now too
5106707 seeing eight in 08 and opening ceremonies starting at 8 08 i guess it was maybe meant to be
5106708 i didnt feel my trigger shaking but i guess it was
5106709 it just hit the trigger the gun went off and i was like uh thats not going to be good
5106710 oh man i feel i can just taste it now
5106711 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
5106712 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5106713 for us to go home with a silver medal is truly an honor
5106714 i just stayed calm and had a great time out there
5106715 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5106716 his playing partner patrick sheehan told me lee played like someone who has been on the tour forever like he was aged 30 instead of 18
5106717 he played exceptionally well for such a young guy at the upper level of the game
5106718 his driving and iron play was great and his short game was responsible for creating his scores
5106719 his performance has set him up brilliantly for the us amateur
5106720 he will be the only player who will turn up at the championship having undergone such a competitive environment recently
5106721 he made a couple of mistakes today as he was trying to play aggressively
5106722 at the moment he shoots at too many flags but as he improves strategically he will make some better decisions and realise he doesnt have to shoot at every flag every time
5106723 i am confident his game has what it takes he stood up to immense pressure today and shot a good number
5106724 without being arrogant he feels he belongs here and feeling good enough to be here is important
5106725 he has worked really hard over the last eight or nine months and its paying off with his game coming together
5106726 in recent memory this is the best performance by a new zealand amateur

5106730 obviously were very sad by the deaths mr thew said
5106731 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5106732 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5106733 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5106734 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this
5106735 leave me alone now and let me get on with it
5106736 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5106737 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5106738 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5106739 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5106740 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5106741 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5106742 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5106743 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5106744 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
5106745 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
5106746 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
5106747 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
5106748 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
5106749 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
5106750 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
5106751 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
5106752 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
5106753 thats a phenomenal speed and most people wont be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds let alone two hours
5106754 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits
5106755 olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve
5106756 our concern is that the interest in the carbon value of forests could lead to a land grab motivating outside actors to come in and take over forest areas and drive local people off their land
5106757 i think itll ride things out pretty well these are pretty sturdy and its tied if something happens i think itll be alright
5106758 like potpourri and death i like it so and so does miss edith
5106759 you promised us revenge dana and off you go cavorting with deities leaving us here to languish in provincial caves
5106760 i appreciate your honesty and i promise that were all reunited now and much death will follow drusilla honey wheres your puppy sweetie
5106761 hes over there i think i played too hard with him he doesnt squeak so much no more
5106762 what are we going to do now that youre home
5106763 drusilla you almost broke him for good i have big plans for him
5106764 hes family you know and our family is going to start something unstoppable so we all need to be a hundred and ten percent
5106765 so is that before or after you clean off the dried blood
5106766 my god what did you do anyway you look like a teen horror movie victim
5106767 i went to san diego and ate what was left of my family
5106768 darla for the love of god hes fucked do we have anything thatll work on him fast the blood of six virgins a good romp with one under the full moon
5106769 oh my baby girl i have just the treat for our puppy
5106770 i found her in the cemetery itll revive his blood
5106771 you cant do this to me buffy will kill all of you
5106772 if shes going to kill me fine great but when one is marked by the gods for a big destiny like me slayers matter less and youre going to be dead either way so shut up youre giving me a headache
5106773 well do we have supplies i have medical supplies dont i
5106774 we can argue comparative theology later okay get to work and save my vampire brother okay
5106775 if youre going to be difficult youll just die now if not youll die when youre done with spike who knows whatll happen in thirty minutes
5106776 drusilla there will be no more heaven no more hell either
5106777 its my final reward oblivion nothing or maybe ill go to hell at least i dont have anything else to hope for
5106778 why would you want there to be no more hope
5106779 dont we all hope when i was ten i hoped to be a doctor a princess and a magician when i was twenty i hoped to have a fulfilling career and a happy live when i was thirty i hoped i could help others and do good work
5106780 six months ago i hoped for two things i hoped that my baby would live and i hoped that my one true love would come back to me
5106781 they found the rest a hundred miles away in a ditch
5106782 shut up or ill pull out your tongue and make you eat it in a sandwich
5106783 im not stable or sane or anything what sort of sane person prays to die and what sort of person prays that everyone dies with her
5106784 its just a question of dying now or later darla whats there to be afraid of
5106785 take it from someones whos been the regular sort of dead theres nothing to it
5106786 you are simply in love with being avenged cant you just get over it we can burn the city to the ground but then well have to eat each other thats being a vampire we like the idea of being gloriously evil but glorious evil is inefficient
5106787 so i dont want to die anytime soon and neither do you
5106788 little sisters got a secret in her heart but she doesnt know its there
5106789 shell stop the world on a platter to watch it spin or fall apart
5106790 now come here little girl ill show you what it feels like to stop hoping

5106793 do you get it we dont have destinies we dont need grand schemes we live for the kill and for each other thats all thats what we are if you cant deal with that you should fucking kill yourself already and put us all out of our misery

5106825 because we analyze large volumes of spam we were able to identify the point where this campaign switched from cnn to msnbc and provide compelling evidence that the attack is from the same source
5106826 from the msnbc perspective the problem is that anyone who subscribes to their alerts will receive a bogus e mail whose format is exactly the same as a legitimate msnbc alert depending on your e mail program you can float your mouse over the url and find out where the message originated but if you have a program like outlook that is not possible

5106834 except for the part where hes into me like hardcore hed want me to find him
5106835 hes dead and glory killed both of them to hurt me
5106836 sounds great except for the part where its totally wrong
5106837 ask the girl i have her key dont i dawn
5106838 you didnt do the sanity suck on me did you because i needed that to think
5106839 but youre crazy how do you know whats real and whats in your head
5106840 i cant explain when she killed your friend and about time she broke down in a way i dont understand
5106841 i dont get her she has destiny she has power shes got that hellgod wrapped around her finger and then she decides to go crazy and start killing people for no reason i like death dont get me wrong but i dont want to die over my meal
5106842 probably taking the key to her hellgod boss to start the apocalypse danas on a serious apocalypse kick think angelus before he got souled and boring
5106843 but youre thinking apocalypse on the mouth of hell i think thats not a crazy idea
5106844 glorys a hellgod dont you think shed be more original than that
5106845 look im sorry your little witch friend is dead it sucks when you lose the ones you love especially to clearly inferior beings still not sorry spike is dead but i didnt ever like him but youve got to watch your attitude i was made by the master himself
5106846 do you know where dana is do you know how we can stop her or glory from destroying dawnie
5106847 so i believe that rileys suggestion is our most solid one and i suggest
5106848 have you ever considered the fact that a sane person who plays crazy in earnest is in fact a crazy person
5106849 not really much about thinking about hamlet or crazy people
5106850 get to the point dana then give me my key or ill have to get stern and boss like and then kill you
5106851 then ill be brief as we all know or should know hamlet pretended to be crazy so he could get revenge but he got so good at it that basically we dont know if hamlet was crazy or sane but if we consider the hypothesis that hamlet knew when he was crazy and when he was sane it doesnt matter because he was whatever he believed himself to be
5106852 so he basically decided if he was sane or not how
5106853 see it doesnt matter how he knew or if he knew
5106854 fucking who cares about hamlet give me the key dana ill get you a pretty room where you can explain about hamlet to a bunch of people who give a shit
5106855 youre not going to try this are you you need it alive i can snap its neck before you kill me
5106856 why wont you give me my key dana i need it you dont
5106857 ive decided im keeping her until i find the person whos best at taking care of her
5106858 who knows the winds all wrong for answers go away glory come back when you can convince me that youre the best thing for dawn
5106859 do you know the guy who wrote this are all bloggers really like that
5106860 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5106861 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5106862 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5106863 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5106864 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5106865 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5106870 id like to talk to the minister as soon as theyre appointed so we can get on with it
5106871 theyre chronically underfunded chronically understaffed chronically under pressure and i think they have great difficulty in getting their job done
5106872 it would be nice to see some of the current surplus spent on those sorts of programs so that we actually have fewer people in prison
5106873 if theres a choice about where moneys being spent i would like to see a considerable amount money being spent on the community rehabilitation programs
5106874 senator obama why did you decide to run for president

5106877 up until last year wed had no enquiries on location intelligence

5106880 its not a new topic by any means weve been playing in the space for over 20 years our perspective is that its interesting to see other non traditional sectors taking interest in having a spatial component
5106881 were seeing increased interest but i could put that down to the technology now being more advanced

5106896 obviously were very sad by the deaths mr thew said
5106897 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5106898 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5106899 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5106900 apparently he was a very capable skier its believed he may have clipped another persons ski which caused him to go off course it was just an accident its one of those very unfortunate things
5106901 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5106902 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5106903 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5106904 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5106905 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out
5106906 everything i want to do was based on the love story
5106907 social security has lifted millions of seniors and their families out of poverty without it nearly 50 percent of seniors would live below the poverty line
5106908 without social security taxes and benefits what would the poverty rate among seniors be
5106909 the underlying system is sound and the actual problem a projected cash shortfall over the next 75 years is relatively small and can be readily solved for starters that means strengthening the program over the long term by returning to basic fiscal responsibility so were not borrowing billions from the social security trust fund
5106910 the bush privatization plan that sen mccain now embraces would tell 39 000 new hampshire residents that theyre on their own putting them at risk of falling into poverty and costing each of them more than 235 000 over their lifetimes
5106911 it means ensuring social securitys solvency while protecting middle class families from tax increases or benefit cuts and without raising the retirement age what i will do is ask those making over 250 000 a year to contribute a little more as part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years starting a decade or more from now

5106919 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
5106920 i disagree with the church all of the time theres hardly ever a time that i agree with it except on social justice issues
5106921 i dont hear much that would be a little spooky
5106922 they cant run me out of this church no matter how hard they try and that sense of inclusion that you feel when you are with other catholics and with people who have been raised in the same way and have the same like mindedness and sense of love and giving is very strong
5106923 being catholic now prominent americans talk about change in the church and the question for meaning
5106924 before becoming pope cardinal ratzinger was a staunch defender of the magisterium of the catholic church
5106925 your eminence in view of the tragedy unfolding in africa for the sake of the sanctity of life would you consider changing the churchs position on the use of condoms
5106926 i believe that all of us who call ourselves american and catholic need to recover what it really means to be catholic
5106927 when the church leaders refrain from helping political leaders see their moral responsibilities their lack of action implies that religion has nothing to say to the public square
5106928 if we keep our eyes on the essentials well stick together stay together and move forward
5106929 be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity
5106930 the biggest problem we have is the troika that has been set up to tear hillary down
5106931 lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people its not a republican movement or a democratic movement but a broad based movement centered on the idea that america is ready for change
5106932 this effort may bankrupt the campaign and provide little if any political advantage
5106933 are we going to tell everyone out there the truth about who voted for what when or are we going to selectively tell people
5106934 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
5106935 given the lack of polling information for post 5 feb states these projections are based on best estimates
5106936 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
5106937 that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong
5106938 we have begun but must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5106939 preempts obamas reiteration on march 5th that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win
5106940 we cannot secure enough delegates to win we cannot overtake him the math simply doesnt work it is imperative that we provide a clear and tenable answer to the single most important question we face
5106941 but senator clinton has given howard wolfson both the responsibility and the authority to make final decisions about how this campaign delivers its message
5106942 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
5106943 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
5106944 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
5106945 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
5106946 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
5106947 it is interpreted in the muslim world as a war on islam and we dont need this
5106948 the face of terror is not the true faith of islam thats not what islam is all about islam is peace
5106949 we are at war with terrorism and its underlying ideology not islam and weve gone out of our way to make that point in truth war has been declared upon us
5106950 domestic calls escalated over the weekend to the highest level its been in a long time in wanganui
5106951 these kids know the signs and they know what it can lead to thats why they ring us because it always has the potential to be serious
5106952 how do i record my systems audio when i make a video
5106953 whether its once an hour or once a day whatever works for you check e mails at intervals as opposed to constantly reacting
5106954 may moderate the relationship between e mail volume and feelings of e mail overload
5106955 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
5106956 if its a multiparty case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
5106957 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
5106958 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
5106959 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
5106960 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
5106961 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
5106962 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood
5106963 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
5106964 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
5106965 i totally understand why you would want to have a size limit on the files that are uploaded but why not at least offer an option for longer videos if stored locally i am only using my drive space why should you care if i make a video longer than 5 minutes for my own usage
5106966 that was just an awesome effort by this army team
5106967 we had a great car today and the team really did a great job on pit road tony gibson crew chief made a great call to take four tires there at the end and the car really liked fresh tires today
5106968 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5106969 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5106970 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5106971 i bought two strikers and maybe i made a rod for my own back because you cant play 4 4 2 here unless you play 4 5 1 you get overloaded theyre just too good
5106972 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5106973 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem

5106977 just wanted to issue an update on the status of the down and kingdom of sorrow touring obviously my commitment is to down and i cannot wait for these australian and japanese dates as well as the metallica shows in the u s starting on october 21 and concluding on november 23 i am beyond honored and excited since kingdom of sorrow has been confirmed on the gwar tour during october november for a while i am insisting that they find a fill in for me and do the tour but i will try and make as many shows as humanly possible it looks likely that i will be able to finish the last few weeks of the tour with them
5106978 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion

5106993 the data gave the us dollar some support but i think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the us dollar rally
5106994 there have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the australian dollar but i do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the rba minutes for direction

5107023 basically what is proposed is that in the short term us 2 million will be allocated to each of the 18 countries which basically gives an advantage to the smaller countries to whom the us 2 million will mean more in value
5107024 that money will be used to target specific areas of food production and productivity namely machinery planting materials and feeds training and any other critical areas

5107062 united nations figures show the population of africa will grow to 2 15bn by 2050 from the current figure of around 800m africa has between 10 and 12 major players in the telecoms field but whats interesting is that those are no longer bound by the classical colonial boundaries you need only look at mtn which operates in a number of french speaking countries and france telecom which recently bought kenya telkom to see how the market is changing
5107063 the key factor that telecoms operators need to worry about is the stability of regulation
5107064 that was seen in benin where mtn had to shut down its network when the government changed the terms of its licence with very little notice

5107105 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit

5107107 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
5107108 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
5107109 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
5107110 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
5107111 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
5107112 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
5107113 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
5107114 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
5107115 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
5107116 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
5107117 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
5107118 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
5107119 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
5107120 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
5107121 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
5107122 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
5107123 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
5107124 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
5107125 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
5107126 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
5107127 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
5107128 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
5107129 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
5107130 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
5107131 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
5107132 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
5107133 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
5107134 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
5107135 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
5107136 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
5107137 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

5107205 ill have to admit either not being smart enough or nuanced enough to understand why a group of republican senators would decide to compromise on an issue on which compromise just wasnt necessary on the issue of drilling the country was with the republicans all the way democrats were nervous and beginning to switch sides or making noises about switching sides and the democratic leadership looked foolish and out of touch and 5 republican senators decided apparently that was too much of an advantage to own and handed it all back i simply do not understand political stupidity such as that but i guess i should get used to it since it seems fairly de rigeur for this crop of reps
5107206 oh look at meeeee i found something that nobody on the web has never seen and i dont think it has ever been on digg before
5107207 i was in the laundry the other night and i realised i was standing right next to nadal
5107208 i didnt bother him but he was shoving all his colours and whites in together
5107209 i want to wear it all the time but you wont believe it the ribbon is already fraying after one trip out made in china

5107211 the aussies are pretty quiet this time around maybe because theyre not doing as well but given my room mates are still competing it wouldnt be great to come in drunk at 3am but you do see it in the village in athens some of the swim girls just went crazy
5107212 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village
5107213 and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things
5107214 it is a pretty amazing place full of people who really look after their bodies
5107215 i remember going into the english hq and there were literally huge bowls of condoms everywhere my mate said dude this is going to be amazing
5107216 10 000 people walking around hyped up on their own glycogen
5107217 you can almost see the sparks flying off their skin

5107224 one of the lessons from the southwest debacle is that these system inspections matter
5107225 they are one of the best indicators of whether an airline has its act together when it comes to maintenance and safety compliance clearly the faa needs to bring more focus and leadership to meeting its own self imposed deadlines
5107226 an airline does not have an interest in cutting corners
5107227 a congressional committee is investigating regulators decision to grant immunity to continental airlines pilots for mistakes that led to an el paso mechanic being sucked into a jet engine in 2006 the faa granted amnesty over the objections of a veteran safety inspector phil thrash who reported his concerns to the faas administrator and the u s department of transportations inspector general they washed their hands of the whole matter
5107228 there are multiple standards for aircraft maintenance regulations faa oversight and tsa security regulations
5107229 inexcusably the reauthorization bill is stalled in the senate over a 25
5107230 this failure of leadership on such a strategically important issue to this country is regrettable
5107231 youd know where your aircraft was last inspected and repaired
5107232 therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded of you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
5107233 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5107234 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5107235 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behaviour characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5107236 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5107237 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5107238 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can

5107241 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5107242 as of now were playing the game monday if the storm runs in its current path tuesday would be in doubt we should know monday night about tuesday
5107243 there is no talk about moving games to another city after monday the angels possibly could go to miami or atlanta that depends on the path of the storm and whether we have to evacuate
5107244 its the sound of the police you hou its the sound that i miss you hou

5107249 we have to earn a competitive return it has to be done in the right sequence and with the right technology
5107250 we know how to differentiate we know how to deliver and we know how to win
5107251 weve had one milestone that weve missed out of a few hundred so far
5107252 in tough economic times most of us look for ways to save money maybe we have to be more mindful of travel and the cost of fuel so it becomes more practical to use a device to make a video call
5107253 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5107254 wherever we go we try to make an impact both economically and spiritually on the people that live there and we hope being here this week people will be changed communities will be changed

5107256 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them

5107262 the o2 oxygen concentration of the atmosphere has been measured off and on for about 100 years now and the concentration 20 95 has not varied within the accuracy of the measurements

5107264 i saw them on tv they are very cute i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breastfeed them i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5107265 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession the babies are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5107266 what they need most is a dwelling to live in
5107267 i hope the government will give them an apartment with the help of allah they will make it but i think that it will be difficult
5107268 a very credible threat of a complex or spectacular attack in the city
5107269 i held him and held him because i simply did not want to let him go
5107270 i wanted to hold him forever so that all who knew him could come and mourn him
5107271 as i stood with the soldiers nearby i heard the russian warplanes coming we threw ourselves at the ground
5107272 then the bombs fell and the earth shook i am a god fearing man and i prayed
5107273 the russian jets came over in several waves their bombs falling between the houses hitting people who didnt have anything to do with fighting who just happened to live in this country
5107274 as they banked away i saw black smoke rising from the apartments where my brother lived i started to run over the smoking earth
5107275 i ran through the rubble looking for someone alive i was convinced that zviadi still lived
5107276 i searched left right all over i didnt even notice when i tripped over him
5107277 he had shrapnel in the chest blood ran from his ears he had no pulse
5107278 one must write such things and such things must be read because otherwise humans will never understand what war means
5107279 georgian soldiers wanted him to go with them but i wouldnt allow him to go he was a part of me we had spent all our lives together
5107280 he keeps putting his hands to his ears and keeps on diving beneath the bedclothes as if he hears the bombs raining down
5107281 so i wrapped him in one of my shirts and buried him someplace where i hope the bombs wont get him again
5107282 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5107283 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family

5107287 what is it about beans that cause so much gas what can be done to make them less volatile
5107288 this rapid re adjustment during the last three months comes as some discretionary sellers choose not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
5107289 while those who do not have to sell are holding off sellers who are also looking to buy are strongly placed to negotiate an equal or larger reduction in the price of the property they are buying
5107290 in addition buyers currently benefit from the best choice in years
5107291 for example properties that are architecturally desirable or in tight school catchment areas are increasingly attainable
5107292 buyers with specific requirements should take a long term view to try and secure their dream home
5107293 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem and perhaps that is where policymakers attention should be focused as the banks can t or wont sort out the mess they were instrumental in creating

5107298 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5107299 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5107300 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5107301 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5107302 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5107303 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5107304 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures

5107311 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5107312 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5107313 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5107314 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5107315 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5107316 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5107317 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5107318 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5107319 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

5107325 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5107326 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5107327 minimize offense to gender racial cultural disabled aged or other identity groups
5107328 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
5107329 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
5107330 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability

5107332 why in the hell would i go to mega mart walgreens when i can get great service from a neighborhood pharmacy
5107333 there are certain things in which mediocrity is not to be endured such as poetry music painting public speaking
5107334 give a man a fire and he is warm for a day set a man on fire and he is warm for life
5107335 in the united states it seems the mainstream media fall in line frequently with their governments spin over international events most of the global news networks are owned and based in the us and therefore tend to set the news agenda worldwide
5107336 what is disturbing is how jingoistic and partisan the us news coverage is over the georgia conflict it is clearer to me now how these us news agencies were able to stir up public support after 9 11 to invade afghanistan and then iraq its frightening how the agencies have in many ways become a mouthpiece for their governments policy
5107337 bush spoke on the topic with increasingly tough rhetoric toward a russia he once considered a promising if imperfect partner on five of six days this week thats a level of public presidential attention that few crises have drawn in his eight years in office
5107338 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5107339 the white house has decided there will be further consequences for russia no matter whether it fully complies with a u s backed cease fire that was signed by saakashvili on friday and by russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday
5107340 for one thing other nations in the region that once were soviet republics or satellites have become nervous
5107341 democrat barack obama and republican john mccain have issued tough denunciations of russia a signal to moscow that the next u s administration will not sweep the georgia war under the rug in the interest of a fresh start with russia
5107342 we build a society based on democratic freedoms and the rule of law he says saakashvili the values that he says he learned during his studies in the united states
5107343 saakashvili insists that if georgia succeeds on the path it has chosen other countries in the region will follow russian leaders think georgia is part of a conspiracy targeted against them he concedes they do not believe we act on our own making our own free choice
5107344 in this conversation with full scale war just 2 hours away the georgian president insists that his country does not seek conflict with russia
5107345 but at the same time in this interview saakashvili is openly contemptuous of his counterparts in russia
5107346 ou know them and their corruption he says you can imagine what horrible consequences there would be if we followed their political and economic model he says he cannot imagine the west not coming to georgias aid it would be like the betrayal of hungary in 1956 or the then czechoslovakia in 1968 when the soviet unions aggressive repression of restive satellites was met with silence from the west
5107347 to giorgi khaindrava one of the leading georgian opposition figures saakashvili was an idiot a chess player utterly incapable of thinking more than a single move ahead even russian democrats were skeptical about misha saakashvili they cannot forgive his clampdown on the independent imedia tv station last year during the massive opposition riots in tbilisi
5107348 one of saakashvilis closest associates conceded that yes mistakes had been made he recalled that misha the nickname for saakashvili used by those in his inner circle had once called vladimir putin liliputin a reference to the little people of swifts gullivers travels he should not have said this this associate said acknowledging at least implicitly that in the confrontation with russia it was very much georgia in the lilliputian role
5107349 russian president vladimir putin has accused georgian leaders of seeking to resolve their countrys territorial disputes by force mr putin told russian tv viewers that in georgias breakaway abkhazia region people are very concerned about the militarisation of georgia
5107350 russia was also alarmed by the current leaderships policy of resolving these problems by force he said
5107351 the pro russian separatist authorities in abkhazia and south ossetia want independence from georgia but tbilisi has vowed to reimpose its rule in the rebel regions
5107352 mr putin warned that it would be a big mistake for georgia to resort to force we cannot allow bloodshed in this region he said he insisted that russia did not have territorial ambitions in the caucasus
5107353 were not trying to increase our territory we have enough territory he said
5107354 i adore alaska where youre fishing next to bears you spend most of the time fishing and youre creeping along looking for stuff signs you see heaps of bear s t and theres one still steaming and you cant see the bear and that sort of gives you the willies is frightening but thats my kick i was up near the logging trails up in vancouver a year ago and i was in the middle of the river one mate was nearly a quarter of a mile down the river so im tying this fly and i hear this thing come crashing through the trees right in front of me
5107355 i couldnt do anything so i went into a ball i thought if hes coming over this is it all i had was a big knife my heart was beating out of my chest i thought it was a bear but it was a deer i just squatted in the middle of the river and the deer just swam across the river i got the camera and i got pictures of that thankfully it wasnt a bear i lived to tell the story
5107356 there was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive felt it was a misplaced cockiness
5107357 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over five points in this day and age
5107358 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5107359 theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5107360 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5107361 youre either a cheater or you breakup and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no bulls i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal
5107362 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5107363 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
5107364 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
5107365 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
5107366 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
5107367 this is the biggest thing the city has had to coordinate for the city
5107368 the main thing is we wanted to be fair and up front
5107369 our officers are going to work for our supervisors doing something to assist denver
5107370 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
5107371 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
5107372 eu pensei comigo o que aconteceu por que elas n o est o vindo
5107373 talvez elas pensaram que eu n o chegaria entre as tr s primeiras

5107375 fiquei sempre olhando para tr s porque n o queria perder a medalha
5107376 foi uma grande performance mostrei o que eu posso fazer
5107377 ocorreu uma fatalidade isso foi uma falta de sorte mas olimp ada assim mesmo e hoje n o foi nosso dia
5107378 se fosse s a falta dava para seguir o problema foi que acabei caindo e eliminado

5107384 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5107385 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5107386 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5107387 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5107388 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5107389 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5107390 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5107391 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers
5107392 improving the management of water and land resources for food livelihoods and nature
5107393 irgendetwas im motor muss gebrochen sein nichts gro artiges aber dennoch gro genug um uns aus dem rennen zu nehmen
5107394 das rgert mich denn wir hatten heute ein top 10 auto wir haben uns von startplatz 32 aus nach vorne gearbeitet das ist f r uns eigentlich eine gute strecke und es ist in sachen punkte sehr entt uschend aber noch haben wir drei rennen und wir k nnen den chase nach wie vor schaffen
5107395 ich hatte in meinen drei jahren bei evernham noch kein einziges motorenproblem aber das hier kam leider ohne jede vorwarnung
5107396 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5107397 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily on the east and south coasts
5107398 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would be simply and impossible task both in financial and engineering terms
5107399 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest
5107400 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5107401 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations
5107402 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5107403 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5107404 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand us dollars
5107405 this trendy cafe is hidden in a super industrial neighborhood without the typical hustle bustle in the city
5107406 i was letting the tournament slip away on 10 and 11

5107408 i struck the ball really nicely and putted solid holed some really nice putts today
5107409 i guess were supposed to like it because it comes from a store in gourmet ghetto but its really not very good
5107410 wait wait its not about money its not about money its just that to go to all this work and expense for a childs cake

5107412 im not going to allow you to go out this way
5107413 oh no just an excuse to revel in white guy sexism and
5107414 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5107415 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
5107416 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
5107417 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
5107418 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
5107419 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
5107420 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
5107421 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
5107422 the project gives us a unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
5107423 ill gun your sorry ass down if you touch fifi my pet gorilla

5107429 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5107430 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5107431 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5107432 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5107433 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5107434 in my own reality i know that these things did happen
5107435 without him in them i can display them i can look at those pictures and think of the laughter we were sharing the places we went to
5107436 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
5107437 is fulfilling the wish that all of us have to make reality to our liking
5107438 this faked photograph actually created the assumption people kind of remember him as there
5107439 everyone understands that its not a trick thats the nature of the photograph
5107440 its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true
5107441 theyre a record they have existed over time and space

5107461 small cap results have been clearly weaker than large cap both in terms of share price reaction and subsequent analyst earnings per share revisions
5107462 this appears to reflect greater sensitivity to the local and nz business cycle and the concentration of manufacturing businesses at the small cap end of the market
5107463 the results to date in numeric terms have not been hugely disappointing
5107464 they have shown the australian economy is not yet in the depths of any overly significant downturn
5107465 the companies themselves and some investors have some concerns about where the economy might be taking us in the next year
5107466 tighter financial conditions and softening domestic demand have been associated with a sharp slowing in credit expansion to both households and businesses
5107467 the latest indications of investment intentions are still relatively strong though some scaling back of existing plans should probably be expected given recent declines in confidence and softer household demand

5107502 nowadays even in paris and london its no rare thing to walk into a vintage clothing store and come out disappointed but in tokyo where the vintage market is fiercely competitive and the customers knowledgeable its always a challenge to go in there and see whats going on check out what other people are wearing
5107503 customers coming in were all asking for jeans and flannel shirts back then no one had the means or distribution network to bring these in so we shifted our focus from imported merchandise to used and vintage
5107504 the problem has always been with size the fact is clothes made overseas are just too large for the japanese body
5107505 unfair and inaccurate to call taos products vintage or recycled products what theyre creating is something completely new
5107506 it is obvious that our advertisement offended some people however sales clearly went up
5107507 i think there are far too many nodes on every gt map the game is all about who can take most nodes gt and spam first
5107508 tenemos 29 a os reclam ndole al estado dominicano que cumpla con su responsabilidad constitucional de ubicar estas familias victimas de aquella tragedia en viviendas dignas y a trav s del tiempo solo hemos recibido promesas enga os y mentiras
5107509 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5107510 unbeknown to the patrol civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5107511 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present the enemies of afghanistan have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for
5107512 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time we can confirm that four civilians lost their lives
5107513 they have qualified here on their own terms we did not need a wild card to compete
5107514 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough
5107515 so i decided to have ligation because life is hard
5107516 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and poverty reduction
5107517 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
5107518 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

5107526 im still kind of numb because i cant believe what im doing
5107527 dont sit back and go oh i wish i could
5107528 its been impossible for me to be excited about anything
5107529 but this was great so maybe this is a turning point
5107530 miss em has resigned shes been an asset to the internet blah blah please join me in wishing her well
5107531 we were very fast on defense looked like we were confident and knew what we were doing but on offense we did not move the same way
5107532 we are running out of time and i think particularly some of the younger players were caught by the speed and intensity versus whatever few full speed reps weve had in practice they werent the same full speed as we had in the scrimmage theyll have to adjust their level of concentration a little better
5107533 jake lanefskis injury has hurt because he had the ability to play both guard and center but he hasnt been with us we are going to experiment with brad durham a little bit at right guard to give us a little bigger body in there we just need some more people to get up to speed a little bit and do a better job we are not executing quite as well james alexander is on the injury list and hes basically our third tackle so were missing a few of the pieces but they arent competing as well as id like them to compete
5107534 he did a lot of good things but he didnt get a lot of help
5107535 his arm was a little weary and we held him out of throwing today but he just didnt get a lot of help protection broke down routes were not run the correct way and the passing game is all about timing and when its broken down by having to run for your life or the routes not being run then it can all go to pieces
5107536 i think you have to relate youth in some aspects but at the same time when we run our bread and butter plays that weve been running around here for four or five years there is no excuse for us not executing and being almost perfect
5107537 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
5107538 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel

5107542 wed spend friday nights in our flat with five or six laptops going with me painting the covers
5107543 it misleadingly suggests evolutionary development in fact the groups work is as traditionally hook based as anything from rock to hip hop to systems music and decisively downplays anything resembling unpredictably free associative playing
5107544 why would we after all we love hooks we recognise the same kind of things in a kings of leon record as we do in a branford marsalis quartet record thats an awesome melody thats a nice bassline thats a kicking beat
5107545 take us living together playing together its like an indie rock band formula in a lot of jazz youre a composer who picks the artists you want to work with were best mates which makes the chemistry between us really different
5107546 you get the best out of people theyre not coming to see you theyre not expecting to see you so when they stop ask questions and stick around it says everything
5107547 if you can make music for yourself that still communicates thats the ideal
5107548 and if buskings not direct communication i dont know what is
5107549 thats whats great about him hes not going ooh im the only one out here in shorts maybe i should put some tights on

5107551 i dont know about the candidates for norwegian sports personality of the year
5107552 ive been in firms where the drive for perfection turned into insanity
5107553 lawyers look for every possible fact every possible angle every possible document etc the result is they are overwhelmed with facts and tasks so much so that there is no time for refection or thought about the case
5107554 due to tennessees oppressive election access laws ms mckinney will be listed on the ballot as an independent candidate which we can achieve with 275 valid signatures
5107555 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural

5107592 damage to the environment only happens where there is no definition and enforcement of individual rights in resources like land water air wildlife carbon sinks and electromagnetic spectrum markets are the best mechanism for protecting the environment because they can factor the consequences of pollution into the cost calculations of each potential polluter and encourage the owners of a resource to preserve it markets also allow consumers to reward and punish producers for their impact on the environment green pricing i e pollution taxes would stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect our environment and ecosystems
5107593 we dont need another gulag or stalag or prison or whatever you want to call it
5107594 we dont anticipate large numbers of arrests we think we are going to have a wonderful convention here
5107595 we would be remiss if we didnt plan for larger than normal arrests thats what this site does
5107596 we dont need those threats already we are already going to be put inside of cages for doing nothing more than exercising our constitutional rights
5107597 typically you would have participants from both sides that would be arrested
5107598 we have an obligation to keep them safe so we dont want people climbing fences and assaulting each other

5107626 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5107627 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come

5107631 despite the fact that he is adored in the west as an architect of democracy and credited with ending the cold war georgians cannot bear their president
5107632 get out of georgia we dont want trouble here shevardnadze is our friend
5107633 loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
5107634 may have felt that his military after several years of u
5107635 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
5107636 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
5107637 on august 1 the majority party adjourned for five weeks delaying a decision on legalizing new drilling or more likely expanding tax credits until september when the 1990 ban on offshore drilling will expire republicans erupted giving speeches to an empty and dark chamber demanding that they stick around until the ban could be repealed arizona rep john shadegg started typing random codes into the chambers public address system and accidentally typed the correct code allowing republicans brief access to the microphone before it was turned off again suddenly the gop had a message that made democrats quiver they refuse to let us drill here drill now and pay less for gasoline says endangered rep randy kuhl r ny in a new ad we need to drill here and we need to drill now says longtime anti anwr drilling advocate john mccain flicking the pesky ghost of teddy roosevelt off his shoulder but whats been more interesting is the spontaneous order thats sprung up to support the gops newfound drill here drill now dogma

5107644 and you may ask yourself self how did i get here
5107645 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
5107646 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
5107647 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
5107648 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
5107649 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
5107650 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
5107651 the moscow times is one of the worlds great newspapers it has all the news about russian business and politics that a busy person could want concise and well written its columnists are insightful entertaining and fearless and its reviews interesting and informative it is always a treat to read whether in moscow in hard copy or from abroad on the internet
5107652 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5107653 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5107654 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5107655 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
5107656 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
5107657 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
5107658 these homes are genuinely ground breaking in their use of eco technology ultimately that means the homes will require less fuel for heating and lighting and with fuel prices rising so rapidly minimising bills for our residents is a top priority

5107665 the first thing i thought is how did she get those pictures and why didnt anybody call me
5107666 they were using images that belonged to me they did not have my permission to use those images

5107671 every single chinese athlete winning a medal will be in adidas on the podium
5107672 the moment for chinese fans is when the gun goes off and when he crosses the finish line if lius in first place the whole nation will go completely insane with excitement and he will be wearing swooshes
5107673 if you want to lead globally you have to lead in china
5107674 we expected the olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool but the opposite has been the case the market hasnt matured to the stage of the us or uk in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong if you can tie liu xiang or yao ming to your product that has a big impact
5107675 other countries are interested in the olympics but in china well over 90 of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved
5107676 for us its about connecting with athletes we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates
5107677 theyre a lot cheaper but the style and technology of adidas and nike are better i usually buy nike for running but a lot of the adidas casualwear looks really good

5107679 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5107680 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5107681 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5107682 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5107683 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5107684 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5107689 there go the mets spending too much money on another player
5107690 he will never be the same pitcher he was when he was with the twins
5107691 it just seemed like the puck was on a string
5107692 i made a couple of dekes and the puck just stayed with me pecs made a nice pass up and it was a one on two we had three guys back so i figured i might as well try something
5107693 im arresting you on suspicion for assisting suicide and manslaughter
5107694 i have thought long and hard about who the most qualified candidate for vice president is and there is no question in my mind that her name is hillary rodham clinton
5107695 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5107696 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5107697 green army in the kashmir valley red army in ladakh amp the saffron army in jammu
5107698 red army in ladakh green army in the kashmir valley amp the saffron army in jammu
5107699 it also said that if all points are met with jammu will still feel discontent since their is a political disparity
5107700 these were pakistan president pervez musharrafs words in an independence day eve function on wednesday shortly after india firmly asked islamabad to stay out of the jammu and kashmir issue
5107701 my address will be incomplete if i dont speak about what is happening in srinagar or indian held kashmir i know and all of you know as well that in the past few days 22 innocent civilians have died including sheikh abdul aziz i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is withtheir brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir
5107702 the jhelum valley route was until the partition the easiest route from the punjab to kashmir it was also convenient for those who wished to proceed towards attockand peshawar from kashmir it also must have been used for kashmirs trade with persia and western turkistan hiuen tsiang and entered kashmir from the west by this route and it is by this route that many learned scholars and sufis from persia and turkistancame to the valley
5107703 we would see the red army in ladakh the green army in the valley and the saffron army in jammu
5107704 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
5107705 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5107706 if your mother tells you she loves you check it out
5107707 describing him as a professional diligent employee of high integrity
5107708 it simply took for granted that the students felt they had been racially discriminated against it was not interested in what mr williamson had to say about the matter
5107709 an allegation that one is racist or discriminates against others is a very serious allegation failing to investigate such a serious allegation fully and fairly was a very serious breach of duty

5107712 the fringe was well warned about bringing in an untested system if theyre talking about trying to get a new system up and running after october its far too late
5107713 the fringe needs to adopt an existing box office system that is successfully in use elsewhere
5107714 this is the most comprehensive and transparent review process into how we sell fringe tickets that has ever been undertaken
5107715 well feed the findings of the inquiry and it review into the wider debate on the fundamental role and operation of the fringe society
5107716 everyone on the fringe needs to work much better together and the fringe society needs to concentrate on getting back to basics
5107717 perhaps it shouldnt be getting involved in events like fringe sunday which ties up a huge amount of time and resources there has been no real change in how the fringe is marketed for several years now that desperately needs to change
5107718 the fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world but is currently run on rules and regulations drawn up in the 1950s its very quaint but has to change
5107719 there needs to be a root and branch review so that the fringe becomes much more representative of the actual venues and gives them a proper voice which just isnt happening at the moment
5107720 there has already been some talk about having an extraordinary general meeting in the winter and i think a one day conference into the future of the fringe would also be worthwhile
5107721 there should be associate membership available to the likes of performers and its also important that stakeholders like the city council and the scottish government are given a say
5107722 there is a general malaise which has afflicted the fringe society and at the moment it really lacks credibility with a lot of people
5107723 it needs to be much more responsive to the needs of artists and performers and concentrate on how it can help them more than it does at present
5107724 we just need 2 hoses and we can knock this fire down
5107725 paved the way for placing the first iranian satellite in orbit
5107726 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5107727 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of international atomic energy agency discussions and are inconsistent with their u n security council obligations
5107728 no information about the cause of the crash the driver has not been ticketed if he was indeed at fault
5107729 im glad i exercised my rights if only this driver had taken the confident cyclist course hed know he was a bad man for getting angry at me
5107730 ele assinou tr s decretos um deles com a demiss o do governo outro com a proclama o do estado de emerg ncia na oss tia do sul e o terceiro com a cria o de uma comiss o da emerg ncia encarregada de liquidar as conseq ncias da agress o georgiana
5107731 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5107732 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5107733 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5107734 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5107735 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5107736 there were kids running around and finally they got tired of that and just watched the film and were completely transfixed
5107737 i remember thinking where else are they going to see that not on tv and i thought how easy it would be to infiltrate that kind of stuff into childrens lives
5107738 a week later i got a prize and a bonus from a film studio that exactly covered it
5107739 and attention to the project itself people are taking it seriously
5107740 you can see films like this in paris and now you can see them in nairn
5107741 if you come in a kilt for powell and pressburgers i know where im going you can come in free
5107742 and when im off on sundays i miss all his undies
5107743 i would have switched it off if it had been on telly but actually i quite enjoyed it
5107744 usually going to the cinema now is all about guarantees did it get good reviews how is it doing at the box office will i get comfortable seats and be able to buy toxic waste sweets
5107745 going to a restaurant that you trust and saying feed me people are coming not because they know all the films we are showing but out of trust people have said its like going to the pictures as a child being taken and told you are going to love this and you know anyone can do this all you need is some dvds and a space
5107746 for once you can happily look around and actually make eye contact with people its the shared enthusiasm thats so compelling
5107747 blessed are the geeks for they shall internet the earth
5107748 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
5107749 i didnt know if she was going to live or die
5107750 we always try to have a lot of respect for one another out there and it got really dicey on that restart
5107751 we got three and four wide and my car was really good rolling through the middle there and i guess tony got to the outside of the 48
5107752 it just looked like tony kind of came down and there was just no room to move because we were all so tight coming off there
5107753 were doing our thing like we do every weekend we work hard drive hard and try to do the best job we can there is no pressing anything if the car has got it ive got it if the pit crews got it then we show it and when it doesnt it doesnt i mean you just go to work when its not
5107754 le vrai bonheur ne d pend daucun tre daucun objet ext rieur il ne d pend que de nous
5107755 nul besoin de temples nul besoin de philosophies compliqu es notre cerveau et notre coeur sont nos temples
5107756 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5107757 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5107758 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5107759 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5107760 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5107761 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5107762 you vote for mike dewine you get more of the same
5107763 you get more tax cuts for the wealthy you get more special interest government in some sense its the republican playbook this year no new ideas
5107764 we were working on it all the way from the 32nd position we did a lot of good things and this is a good race track for me and the whole team to have a bad race is disappointing with the points but its what it is weve got three races to go and we can still definitely make the chase
5107765 we are falling behind getting into the chase and need to be more consistent
5107766 we just cant seem to get there every week its something
5107767 if my having a temper tantrum was going to fix things id do that too but i know thats not going to fix it
5107768 all we can do is go out there and focus and do our jobs
5107769 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
5107770 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this
5107771 leave me alone now and let me get on with it
5107772 that is a very bad image for a king smoking your head off
5107773 im very happy that you can ask that question very very happy and i hope it gets asked a lot

5107786 this collection is an excellent introduction to an emerging form of war reporting
5107787 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
5107788 now its time to speak for the current majority and bring our troops home
5107789 use of bit 0 20 in dns labels to improve transaction identity
5107790 basically this idea from i think david dagon and paul vixie notices that dns is case insensitive lower case is equal to upper case but case preserving a response contains the same caps as a request so we can get extra bits of entropy based on asking for www doxpara com and ignoring replies containing www doxpara com www doxpara com etc
5107791 im in the exact same position against mr strickland that the president was against mr kerry
5107792 if the 2008 democratic presidential primary were held today for whom would you vote if the candidates were
5107793 the democratic party is hiring organizers chosen by the state parties in every state experienced local activists who know their communities those local leaders recruit more leaders and volunteers until every single precinct in their area has a trained effective organization of democrats dedicated to winning votes for democrats
5107794 the media does not tell voters what to think but the media can tell the voters what to think about
5107795 he felt a chill run up his leg while watching an obama speech
5107796 will you vote for obama even though he a black man
5107797 this application has failed to start because d3ddx26 dll was not found re installing the application may fix this problem
5107798 and he has been staying in shape to show up at our camp in good shape
5107799 we will discover with work in the gym if he will be a key player for our team
5107800 we believe senator obama is the change our nation needs he is the leader who will put america on the path to a clean energy economy that creates and keeps millions of jobs spurs innovation and opportunity and makes us a more secure nation
5107801 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting
5107802 we must steer far clear of the errors and false assumptions that have marked the energy policies of nearly 20 congresses and seven presidents
5107803 government support for an industry that cant stand on its own two feet seems to contradict his record
5107804 if were looking for a vast supply of reliable and low cost electricity with zero carbon emissions and long term price stability thats the working definition of nuclear energy
5107805 i have heard from utilities in my own state that a federal mandate of this sort is largely a requirement to import wind
5107806 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5107807 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5107808 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5107809 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5107810 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5107811 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5107812 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5107813 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5107814 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5107815 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for
5107816 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5107817 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that
5107818 this is more than sit back and watch tv this is lean forward and get immersed tv
5107819 josh is the genuine article he brings an authenticity to a show that goes to difficult locations and is rich with detail we think this will appeal to our core audience who like information to be credible but in an entertaining package
5107820 as an explorer and someone who loves to travel this show is the perfect vehicle for me
5107821 you wouldnt have to pay me to do this i would do it without tv cameras
5107822 after three years it felt a bit constricted we wanted to be as ambitious as possible with into the unknown covering the past present and future

5107825 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5107826 sometimes guys just have off years hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5107827 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5107828 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5107829 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5107830 we attempted to do so by the non waiver and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5107831 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen

5107852 i think hes acknowledged that military action in this particular situation is unlikely but as commander in chief he wants to make sure all options remain available to him and thats understandable
5107853 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war

5107865 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5107866 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5107867 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5107868 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5107869 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures

5107898 and maybe you wouldnt be on foot walking so much if you stopped giving people dirty bad karma and wont solve anything for you
5107899 i dont believe karma has anything to do with the fact that im walking
5107900 i also dont think that i overreacted to the possibility of being hit by a huge vehicle

5107907 major league baseball bullying amateur baseball in trademark shakedown 2008 03 13
5107908 mlb now thinks that it has total control over any team that has a name similar to major league team despite the fact that no one is going to confuse the chatham as with the oakland as or the harwich mariners with the seattle mariners this would appear to be yet another abuse of trademark and hopefully the cape cod league finds a lawyer who can explain to major league baseball the moron in a hurry test to prove that theres no trademark violation

5107917 nearly 40 years after some 80 000 barrels of oil washed up on the beaches of santa barbara and launched a move to ban offshore drilling congress is heading toward a vote to end that moratorium for a generation of democratic politicians the notion of opening protected sites to drilling was toxic but with soaring gas prices public opinion is shifting toward anything that promises relief at the pump and congressional politics is moving with it in a shift on saturday speaker nancy pelosi said that the house will take up comprehensive energy legislation next month that includes partially lifting the 1981 ban on offshore drilling

5107928 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5107929 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5107930 currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5107931 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country
5107932 by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5107933 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5107934 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5107935 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more

5107939 its very humbling i think we take for granted that weve been on top of the game for i dont know how many olympics before it was really hard for me getting in second in 2004 so its definitely hard on us not to get a medal
5107940 poor peoples contingent to demand money for human needs not for war
5107941 important to my community especially communities of color and women welfare should be there to support people when they need it
5107942 its connected to an unjust war needs are unmet here and all over the world we need to get the troops out of there im fed up with the poor bashing agenda spending billions on a war that means families needs arent being addressed were already stretched beyond our means
5107943 people arent given enough time to get on their feet
5107944 this is a nonpartisan cause were at a critical time in history and we need to take to the streets again
5107945 this is the first time minnesotans will be at the forefront were speaking out and letting the world know how we feel
5107946 it is now more important than ever to make a difference its time for change
5107947 at the time we were fighting to tax the rich close corporate tax loopholes and give back to poor families
5107948 whenever theres a budget deficit it comes out of our pockets
5107949 the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer if we dont get decent wages we can barely survive on welfare
5107950 we are all great athletes and i am very excited about the tremendous achievement we have made for our country
5107951 coming into the olympics people thought we were not experienced enough but give us a chance to do something and we make the most of it
5107952 it goes to show when it matters i can really do it and to be part of a race that included an unprecedented 1 2 3 for jamaica was fantastic the london olympics are just on my doorstep i drive past the olympic sites every day on my way to training and to do well there is something i just cant comprehend
5107953 the final is going to be tough christine looked great in the first round
5107954 i gave it all i had but i just didnt have enough left at the end
5107955 ill have a good go whatever happens in the final
5107956 its bloody hard work but thats what its about thats why i have been training so hard
5107957 people are mystified it makes it very much easier for selective schools which dont face the problems those in the national challenge face to get specialist status and extra funding
5107958 it is a new unfairness added to the wider unfairness of the 30 floor target in the national challenge
5107959 its undoubted that being in the national challenge will have damaged schools despite the best intentions the effect of being threatened with closure will impact on these schools for years to come
5107960 we recognise the concern the dcsfs decision will cause some schools but we are confident many of them will meet the floor target consideration will also be given to those that demonstrate good progress towards the target
5107961 we are not taking away these schools specialist status or the associated funding we have postponed their redesignation until after their 2008 gcse results are known but they remain part of the specialist schools programme weve never called these schools failing many are improving are on the right track and are doing a good job for their local communities
5107962 be willing to take some risks because breaks dont just happen
5107963 but be ready and brave enough to know it could fail too
5107964 there has never been an archaeological dig of a prehistoric site in minneapolis
5107965 the rapid expansion of the city basically destroyed most of the archaeological sites here
5107966 i am your true friend and i am willing to die for you
5107967 grabbed by the ear by a nun and told not to speech my language anymore
5107968 in which one foot was never to leave the ground
5107969 creative approach to adversity illness and poor health with a foundation solidly rooted in traditional ojibwe song and dance
5107970 its introduction rallied a communal spirit among ojibwe people and sustains indian people of diverse tribal backgrounds today
5107971 out of that need came the foundation of an activist movement that began to change the whole perception that native people had of themselves
5107972 i asked him a week ago before i went to sun dance say something
5107973 just say something recognize the indian people recognize the contributions that they have made recognize all the work that is being done today
5107974 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5107975 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5107976 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5107977 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5107978 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5107979 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5107980 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures
5107981 not crowded with other people new zealand press agency nzpa reported
5107982 he gets 19 years for dealing coke to drug addicts and 15 for strangling my daughter thats pretty unjust
5107983 robert chambers isnt going to prison for his drug offenses rather hes going to prison for the death of jennifer levin again

5107991 not crowded with other people new zealand press agency nzpa reported
5107992 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
5107993 what we need therefore is a system a method for working out which of the various available alternatives is indeed that best use of our limited resources that method is called a cost benefit analysis how much will it cost to do something and what is the benefit of our doing so but the important point is that we start from now what has happened in the past might be used to guide our estimates of either costs or benefits certainly but money that we already have to spend come what may should not factor in our calculations for money that we already have to spend is a sunk cost whether we use windmills new reactors or those bicycles we still have to clean up the previous generation of nuclear sites whatever we do going forward those costs are there thus they should not be used in calculating which path we should follow
5107994 its with a sense of humbleness and gratitude toward god almighty that he has allowed us to see the completion of this mosque
5107995 the community has been trying to build this mosque for the last 10 years
5107996 i told him i was glad that its already paid for and that i would like to have his list of donors
5107997 i think all of us that are not muslim need to know more about the faith i think this is very beneficial
5107998 there were times we thought we would never be finished in our lifetime
5107999 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5108000 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5108001 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5108002 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5108003 tropical storm fay threatens the state with a major disaster
5108004 fay is expected to reach hurricane strength in the south eastern gulf
5108005 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5108006 unbeknown to the patrol civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5108007 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present the enemies of afghanistan have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for
5108008 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time we can confirm that four civilians lost their lives

5108015 i dont understand how natural processes can account for the increase in complexity of organisms over time
5108016 look the fossil record is the most obvious place to look for evidence of evolution if it were really the embarrassment creationists say it is how do you explain that virtually every paleontologist in the world is an evolutionist and if geneticists really could not explain how genetic information can grow over time one of the fundamental questions any theory of evolution has to explain why would evolution be so overwhelmingly dominant among scientists
5108017 if the storm maintains its current path tuesdays game would be in doubt and then well make a call on wednesday based on tuesday
5108018 and were hopeful well get the series in but two out of three is the most likely case
5108019 but with the unpredictability of the storm its pretty much a wait and see game
5108020 after mondays game theres a possibility they would go to a neighboring city whether its miami or atlanta so they could be close
5108021 but it all depends on the path of the storm
5108022 we have to confer with the city of st petersburg and understand its needs tropicana field is one of the command centers for the city and that will affect the timing of the games at this point its all speculative because the storm is still a good ways away from the coast
5108023 it all depends on the storm the timing of landfall and where it hits
5108024 well talk to the league and decide whether theres the ability to play two or just to play one on wednesday but were hopeful well be able to get in at least two games
5108025 we havent discussed the possibility of a doubleheader in detail with the league but i dont think its very likely there is a mutual off day on sept 1 that is a possibility so at least we know theres a time we can make up the game or games
5108026 were just most concerned about our guys being with their families if this indeed becomes a serious and more serious situation baseball is one thing your family is something entirely more important well just have to deal with that as it goes along well try to get baseball games in but make sure that the players get to be involved with their families
5108027 as crazy as it may be we have to ask questions just as much as anybody else and get as much information as anybody else
5108028 because our phones are going to ring from our families asking what theyre supposed to do and were supposed to know the answers
5108029 i didnt know a lot about his defense when he came
5108030 once he gets more into playing with our team more aggressive at the plate he can be an even better hitter
5108031 he can hit a homer or a big hit for you
5108032 my velocitys jumped up but velocity isnt really a big deal to me
5108033 you still have to get people out and they can all hit a fastball
5108034 as easy as his mechanics are it doesnt look like hes putting out the effort to throw the ball that hard so i think it really catches a hitter off guard
5108035 you dont see many of them lefties with that kind of velocity
5108036 this kid sits there at 94 97 mph its smooth and hes got good arm action
5108037 i felt good going out but i dont know what happened
5108038 hes starting to work breaking balls into more counts obviously he can throw the fastball but i think the biggest thing is developing his secondary pitches so he can become a complete pitcher
5108039 his sliders probably below average right now just because he doesnt have the feel to throw it as hard as he should throw it
5108040 his changeup is probably a touch below average or right at average he has a pretty good feel for it and hes going to throw it a lot better
5108041 if they make a lot of progress in the offseason theyll find themselves in the big leagues soon enough this year would be a push
5108042 i dont think theres really a need to push them that fast in the future youve got two bright stars who can really help the team in arlington for a long time and i think thats what theyre looking for
5108043 viewers a insight look what you and all your team do at your jobs love the clips
5108044 what should be a privilege for a national broadcaster has been turned into an extortion racket holding the olympics hostage with all of us paying the ransom
5108045 this could have been a golden moment for online video too bad nbc just couldnt stick the landing
5108046 were starting with two fuel storage tanks and plan to eventually expand to other tanks located at our kapaa and hanalei baseyards
5108047 the hospital has recognised as has the state of nsw that we need to do something and face this problem
5108048 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5108049 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents
5108050 theyre actually too young to be making a lot of the decisions around what they eat and what they do
5108051 so its a family focused thing to encourage a change in the whole family
5108052 were bombarded with advertisements and easy access to high energy density foods
5108053 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight
5108054 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that
5108055 enough is enough there has got to be a different approach taken
5108056 its something that i think is a unique and interesting part of our history
5108057 ive certainly asked for some work to be done about what the possible costs might be and what sort of assistance we might be able to provide
5108058 i spoke about this earlier this year in parliament it is i think a little known part of queenslands wartime history
5108059 we think we only need to spend 500 on a device
5108060 i should underline the fact these are high quality new generation devices that are in prototype at the moment we would be one of the largest single computer purchasers in the world
5108061 well hollywoods all about money they just make what sells

5108063 since the car is powered by electrical motors found in each of the four wheels
5108064 there is no transmission and you break intuitively by pushing the steering wheel away from your body

5108068 he didnt need any meds he was the kind of kid who if someone had just threatened to call his mother he probably wouldve stopped what he was doing
5108069 i understand drugs for high blood pressure for diabetes but i know mikie and i didnt need emotional stabilizers to live our lives
5108070 the people who are most respected are the ones who talk to drug companies who become consultants for multiple companies because their opinion is really valued
5108071 we prescribe the medication that works best for the patient irrespective of our relationship with a drug company
5108072 if a physician talks to all the companies and prescribes for all the companies then no company has an edge
5108073 in order to ensure that the data procured is as reliable and accurate as possible
5108074 clinical research is a critical element in the development of revolutionary medicines that help patients live longer healthier lives
5108075 you could take statistics and bar charts and make them look pretty much how you wanted them to
5108076 i saw firsthand several circumstances where my minimization of side effects or misinforming a physician had actually resulted in the patient being damaged and or killed
5108077 it makes me wonder what real safeguards there are here to protect foster children in texas from being involved in clinical trials
5108078 whether any wrong is being done or not theres certainly the perception
5108079 but i dont sit there and think hey a concerta rep came in today
5108080 there is more data out for the newer drugs which makes doctors more likely to use them thats why it appears theres something unethical going on with the drug companies when theres not
5108081 he was given three times the amount given to adult patients each of these drugs was given to us by a child psychiatrist
5108082 he was supposed to be in state care but nobody was looking after evan but me
5108083 now my kids dont take medications i wont ever trust doctors again
5108084 the state takes a child that is upset crying yelling and screaming because theyve just been taken from their families and with all those symptoms prescribes them medication
5108085 they think that if the child is unruly its easier to deal with them by medicating them than by counseling
5108086 its a medical model we didnt have any other options
5108087 i always questioned if they didnt need them out there in the real world why do they need them in here but i wasnt about to go against the doctors orders
5108088 were a lot more confident today that children who dont need these medications arent getting them
5108089 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
5108090 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5108091 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
5108092 we are very frustrated right now with the way things are being managed
5108093 all the things we brought to the table they rejected
5108094 workers are saying theyve put a lot into the company and they just want their fair share whats your response to that
5108095 i think they are getting a pretty good compensation package
5108096 both sides are working really hard we hope we can figure something out soon
5108097 get a little bit longer by the jonas brothers on the radio

5108102 it required the company to retain all the pension liabilities for current and former employees of the retail business this is unacceptable to the board
5108103 theres a strong balance between business confidence and the actual performance of the economy and with so many firms remaining downbeat we can expect uk economic growth to remain weak well into next year

5108106 the gardener in me kept looking at it and thinking wouldnt some annuals look good there
5108107 now im known as the oak terrace gardener ive taken care of that garden ever since
5108108 they didnt know what life was like what they were like back then
5108109 she kept telling me that it was time to get this book on the road
5108110 then id slip in another chapter like the one about morris idiosyncrasies it was too hard for me to narrow it all down i guess
5108111 i think ive lived in the past for most of the last three years
5108112 he used to come over to the farm after morris died and sit and have coffee with me in the morning now he farms our land
5108113 im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
5108114 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things
5108115 i was really lost and just really felt like there was no outlet i know theres my mom there but i want the rest of her life to be worry free so i try and keep everything from her i just felt alone you know
5108116 things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late
5108117 i dont want to go too far in depth but there were a lot of rumors
5108118 like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach reid didnt know there were people saying contract didnt want to play anymore and i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought
5108119 i just felt like it was something that i needed to had to do because of the way that i just disappeared
5108120 like i said the things i said that conveyed to them that i didnt want to be here anymore or whatever thoughts were in their minds i just wanted to let them know that it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work im no stranger to hard work
5108121 i just wanted them to know that i hope they still respect me if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain the respect back
5108122 thats the important thing right now keep open communication hes got a good support staff right now and i think hes in a good place well see how it works out
5108123 im not a religious man im spiritual i think a lot of it has to do with god having a calling on my life sometimes it takes bad things to wake you up and realize that god wants you to be who he wants you to be
5108124 swamping the system both at westminster and in the assembly
5108125 the assembly acquired its new legislative powers on the 25 may 2007
5108126 in paragraph 21 of its memorandum the committee refers to the fact that it had expected to have to deal with
5108127 the memorandum states that the committee has already reported on three of the four lcos referred to it and expects to report on the fourth soon
5108128 we have published timely reports on all sic of the proposed orders which have been referred to us so far
5108129 so the committees claims about its performance during the first year of the process obviously does not support any suggestion that the system is being
5108130 in fact the number of lcos which have been proposed in the last 12 months has reached 11 already
5108131 in portraying a picture of a system in danger of being
5108132 during the same period the assemblys own committees have on the other hand fully completed consideration and reported on 7 actual proposed lcos with no suggestion that this has imposed an excessive strain on the assemblys more limited resources and certainly no claim that the system is being

5108135 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media
5108136 i would not have wished my illness on my worst enemy depression is not the same as feeling down or fed up people might say im a bit depressed today but true depression is quite different
5108137 my mind was pulling itself apart in a hundred directions
5108138 then came the pictures in my head specific enormous terrifying images
5108139 we were out in the field but i didnt have a clue what was taking place around me and i was supposed to be captain
5108140 what did i have to worry about i had always been someone who coped but depression doesnt care who it attacks if it wants you you cannot beat it off with a cv or a bank balance
5108141 all the same feelings of irrational fear despair and panic that had taken over my whole being in baroda came back wave after great wave
5108142 we hope our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area and if the melt is not stopped
5108143 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
5108144 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5108145 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5108146 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave
5108147 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5108148 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5108149 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5108150 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5108151 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5108152 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5108153 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5108154 thats all in the past mate im an olympic champion now
5108155 i can tell everybody that it is worth it all the pain and the hardship and worrying if you are as good as you think you are
5108156 some people dont want to win gold they need to it seems that we have a lot of those at these olympics
5108157 you can work for 10 years you can have terrible days but you always are carried on by the idea that one day you will be a winner and that it will all be worthwhile now i can tell you something else one thing you can never imagine is how great it feels to win i thought i knew precisely how it would feel but i didnt i only found out when i had given everything i had and realised that it was enough
5108158 leadership is not just an enjoyment its also a risk

5108161 that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth
5108162 they have a lot of pain but it is not a pain that i would necessarily have spared them i think it ideally initiates a process of self exploration how do i see women if i didnt violate her could i have do i have the potential to do to her what they say i did those are good questions

5108382 theres good talent at the under 23 level that we want to shape towards london 2012
5108383 everyone goes away for a few months gets their heads together and tries to have a semi normal life and regroup and then decide after that
5108384 the guy that got the silver medal today was juri jaanson estonia and he is 42 he is nine years older than me and as long as im still worthwhile out there be it rowing or sailing there is certainly a desire to keep doing sport while i can
5108385 made our life a little harder as expectations are up over what we can do
5108386 it was lovely to see them perform so well hopefully now theyll return re energised for 2010

5108390 among the nats its the leaders choice the prime minister so we could see for example someone like david bennett come through as an under secretary
5108391 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
5108392 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
5108393 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
5108394 yazziebear called me the little dummy sidekick dooter i am not a dummy
5108395 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5108396 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5108397 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5108398 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5108399 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5108400 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5108401 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5108402 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5108403 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5108404 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5108405 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5108406 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

5108412 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5108413 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5108414 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5108415 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5108416 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5108417 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5108418 many in the christian right tend to get their information

5108423 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
5108424 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5108425 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5108426 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5108427 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5108428 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
5108429 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
5108430 vous les juifs devez tre au courant vous naurez jamais mais jamais la paix avec le hamas cest lislam comme id ologie qui les guide et qui ne leur permettra pas de parvenir un accord de paix avec les juifs
5108431 ils estiment que la tradition dit que le proph te mahomet sest battu contre les juifs et que par cons quent ils doivent continuer les combattre jusqu la mort
5108432 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5108433 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5108434 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5108435 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5108436 people and news media tend to focus on what is considered to be controversial rather than focus on the issues that are relevant to a lot of the countries in the region
5108437 a singular focus is not good for anybody and certainly not good for the people that we are trying to be responsible for
5108438 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest
5108439 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5108440 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations
5108441 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5108442 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5108443 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars
5108444 when i leave this house ill take it with me

5108447 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5108448 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5108449 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5108450 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5108451 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5108452 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5108453 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5108454 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5108455 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5108456 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5108457 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5108458 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5108459 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5108460 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5108461 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5108462 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5108463 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5108464 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5108465 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5108466 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5108467 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5108468 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5108469 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5108470 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5108471 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5108472 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5108473 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5108474 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5108475 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5108476 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5108477 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5108478 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5108479 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5108480 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5108481 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5108482 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5108483 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5108484 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5108485 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5108486 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5108487 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5108488 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5108489 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5108490 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5108491 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5108492 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5108493 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5108494 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5108495 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5108496 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5108497 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5108498 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5108499 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5108500 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5108501 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5108502 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5108503 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5108504 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5108505 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5108506 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5108507 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5108508 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5108509 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5108510 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5108511 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5108512 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5108513 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5108514 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5108515 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5108516 just so you all know we did set a record
5108517 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5108518 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5108519 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5108520 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5108521 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5108522 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5108523 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5108524 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5108525 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5108526 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5108527 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5108528 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5108529 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5108530 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5108531 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5108532 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5108533 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5108534 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5108535 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5108536 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5108537 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5108538 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5108539 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5108540 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5108541 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5108542 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5108543 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5108544 cu l es el significado de la vida del universo y de todo
5108545 there was a long period after the first album where i felt disillusioned with the machinery of the industry

5108554 the city pulled its voting machines from here because the building gets too hot yet now theyll put people in there who use those machines to vote
5108555 there are no toilets there theres no water no fire suppression the city should be ashamed it needs to stop criminalizing protests
5108556 i agree that immigrants should learn english but instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english theyll learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual we should have every child speaking more than one language
5108557 in 2005 1 21 million abortions were performed down from 1 31 million in 2000
5108558 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5108559 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5108560 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5108561 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5108562 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5108563 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5108564 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5108565 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5108566 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5108567 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5108568 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5108569 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5108570 estamos encantados con esta muestra que coincide con una exposici n sobre la gran hambruna irlandesa nuestros visitantes salen fascinados y sorprendidos tras conocer el origen de la papa sus cientos de variedades y su historia
5108571 la papa fue de importancia crucial para el desarrollo de las culturas andinas de altitud en donde el ma z no pod a adaptarse f cilmente garantiz la seguridad alimentaria y permiti que culturas precolombinas como tiahuanaco y wari se expandieran y crearan los primeros imperios en am rica del sur
5108572 todo esto lo ignoraba para m la papa era europea
5108573 yo sab a que era originaria de alguna parte de am rica del sur pero nada m s jam s imagin que exist an tantas variedades
5108574 muchos piensan que la papa es irlandesa y quedan sorprendidos al descubrir toda esta informaci n y fascinados al conocer las mil y una formas y colores de papas andinas en europa existen unas 20 variedades pero todas se parecen a la papa blanca
5108575 no existen evidencias irrefutables sobre la primera introducci n de la papa en europa ni exactamente de qu punto de la zona andina parti rumbo al viejo continente lo m s probable es que se haya tratado de introducciones m ltiples una fechada en 1573 en los inventarios del hospital de la sangre de sevilla
5108576 fue esta tercera la determinante para su propagaci n pues los protestantes v ctimas de las persecuciones religiosas se la llevaron consigo al abandonar sus hogares y tierras se ala anderson
5108577 pero tuvieron que pasar m s de 100 a os antes de que la papa fuera bien aceptada y se popularizara en europa en ese lapso tuvo que enfrentarse a la ignorancia y las supersticiones de la gente que la consideraron diab lica y causante de enfermedades como la lepra
5108578 es necesario preservar la papa conservar su biodiversidad y desarrollar m s aun su potencial es un verdadero tesoro que debemos guardar y mejorar para reducir el hambre en el mundo
5108579 en el 2005 es la primera vez que su cultivo en los pa ses en desarrollo super el terreno a l destinado en los pa ses industrializados

5108587 it is a special day for her she is so excited we are just happy she is healthy enough to be here
5108588 i feel like ive definitely gotten better the last week or so
5108589 and really i set out to measure it off of a four game preseason and were not even halfway there yet ive still got some opportunities to go out there and make it happen
5108590 its always good to earn the trust of the quarterback
5108591 but i just have to go out and concentrate on my job of whos in whos out
5108592 im trying to do things to improve my game and be a better player
5108593 i havent arrived as a wide receiver theres still a lot of room for improvement and a lot to be learned and until that time comes i have to push myself to get that done
5108594 it has nothing to do with hamza but how marquands playing
5108595 hes had a great camp hes really professional he prepares in the classroom and works hard out here hes coachable and hes been performing well both in practice and in the game last week
5108596 we used to do that a lot in college and high school
5108597 its one of those things you do so if it is raining tonight youve already practiced for holding and punts all that stuff its good to get ready for it
5108598 i like the way sams been consistent working the ball right and left thats probably been one of his strongest points along with his handling time hes very consistent

5108602 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
5108603 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5108604 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5108605 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5108606 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5108607 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5108608 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5108609 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5108610 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5108611 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5108612 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5108613 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5108614 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5108615 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5108616 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5108617 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5108618 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations

5108620 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5108621 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5108622 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5108623 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5108624 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5108625 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5108626 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5108627 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5108628 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5108629 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5108630 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5108632 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough

5108673 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5108674 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5108675 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already

5108680 the browns and the giants will do battle during the regular season do you look at the first half of this game as a challenge for the giants to make another statement that they are the champs or is it just the second preseason game
5108681 its just the second preseason game it is interesting to me and annoying that the giants seem to get so little respect even though they are defending champs i know they feel the disrespect so i wont worry about lack of motivation during the regular season
5108682 i was really intrigued by the giants decision to trade
5108683 honestly i think its a trade the giants felt they
5108684 it would not be a shocking statement for people to say that the giants wont win the division this season heck people may say theyll finish third in the division considering how good the nfc east is last year the giants showed you dont have to win the division to take the super bowl though do you expect a first place finish for the giants this year
5108685 i mentioned the lack of respect in a previous answer in a way its understandable since the giants were hardly a regular season powerhouse i dont know what to expect because the nfc east has four playoff caliber teams in that division at least one and possibly two very good football teams are not going to make the playoffs
5108686 you asked this question to me and i wanted to return the favor if you could have any one player from the browns who would it be and why

5108688 my users are probably sick of hearing about brett favre already but im compelled to ask you have giants fans been affected at all by the jets acquiring favre are they excited since hes in the same city or could they care less
5108689 i really dont think the giants fans care at all we are like you favre d to death maybe our reaction would be different if we werent defending super bowl champions but we are and that is a huge source of comfort we are still better than the jets and are still new yorks team besides come some cold nasty december day when the jets are getting pummeled we know favre is going to wish he had stayed on his farm

5108757 joe this was my first and hopefully my last experience with kidney stones i had severe pain on new years eve and had to go the hospital were they took x rays they found a single stone which the doctor measured at 6mm the next day the urologist scheduled me for surgery the following week in his opinion i had only a 5 percent chance of passing that size of stone on my own but he did advise me to drink alot of fluids after 5 days of lots of water the stone moved down from just below the left kidney to the entrance of the bladder but could not pass into my bladder confirmed by another x ray in a last chance effort to avoid surgery i discovered your website and my prayers were answered within 12 hours of trying your remedy i could feel the stone pass into my bladder and within a week it passed completely my doctor was shocked joe i cant thank you enough for saving me the physical and emotional cost of surgery and i know this can help others sincerely steve
5108758 hi joe i have suffered with kidney stones for 6 months the pain would hit me when i least suspected it so i had my life and vacations on hold
5108759 i am going on the internet to find a miracle cure
5108760 my first response after using the remedy was that it did not work
5108761 i was scheduled for a cystiscope the following day so i figured i had nothing to lose except the agony i know that follows the procedure
5108762 it ends up that i had two kidney stones i tried the remedy twice and i got rid of the smaller stone that was in my left kidney however the bigger one is in my right kidney and it is still there the urologist said it was a 60 chance it would pass and a 40 they would have to do surgery update i went back to the urologist today and he looked at my ivp results there is no kidney stone the stone i had must have dissolved he was at a loss for words your remedy worked very well it has saved me a lot of money and it has saved me from being off of work i did the remedy twice and it seems to have done the trick thank you very much
5108763 hi joe the other night i went to outpatient with pain that was unbearable i had a ct scan and they found 1 stone 4mm diameter located just above the bladder the next day i followed your remedy and in a couple of hours the stone passed i havent had any further problems your remedy worked great
5108764 hi joe well i have to say buying your remedy to remove kidney stones was probably the best investment i have ever made 10 hours after following your steps the stone passed through i went to see the doctor 2 days later and the x ray in fact showed that my system was clear of any kidney stones i just wish i knew about this remedy before thanks for having it available
5108765 i had been in significant pain since monday requiring a visit to the emergency room and was still in enough pain to require medication on wednesday morning i did not know if i would be able to go on a long weekend trip that had been planned for weeks
5108766 i followed the remedy exactly as written within an hour of finishing it i stopped experiencing any pain although i was unable to find the kidney stone a few times i did not use a screen i have previously passed 2 other calcium oxalate stones but never has one passed with so little pain i am amazed that it passed this easily thanks for saving me so much pain and suffering
5108767 a ct scan revealed 2 more stones in my left kidney the same side all my stones have formed on and i was supposed to have litroscopy 2 days ago i decided to research this procedure and its risks and i inadvertantly came across your method on the internet and thought i had nothing to lose so i gave it a try i passed both stones as a gravel sedament and when i showed up at hospital for another x ray before my scheduled procedure they were gone i was absolutely amazed not to mention my skeptical doctor the method is absolutely pain free and so simple to follow its almost too good to be true i am in awe of the fact that more people i know have not heard of this method and i cant wait to read your report on kidney stone prevention with three little ones i have no time or patience for another pesky stone thank you so much
5108768 hi joe the concept is so deceptively simple yet so astonishingly powerful i am impressed your remedy has worked fantastically well for me for the past 36 hours i have been free of pain looks like the calculus is completely gone

5108776 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail

5108786 ive dreamed of a lot of things and written down a lot of goals and this one was the biggest one i had ever written down you can imagine anything to work through having ups and having downs to accomplish everything you have ever dreamed of it feels good
5108787 i just saw mom for one minute we just hugged and she started crying and then my sister started crying im glad ive been able to accomplish everything ive wanted
5108788 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5108789 it is astounding his individual records will be broken but who can say if his eight gold medals will ever be beaten
5108790 i hate the word freak but he is in a world of his own he is staggering
5108791 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5108792 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5108793 he may be human but hes from a different planet
5108794 theres nothing wrong with giving up so long as what youre giving is good and youre not giving it in too upward a direction
5108795 when live gives you lemons dont put them into a story nobody needs those kind of lemons
5108796 im convinced the american electorate is too mature to be taken in by cheap vaudeville trickery after all if our national leaders were elected on the basis of trickery slogans brass bands and pretty girls our country would be in a terrible mess wouldnt it
5108797 youll be going to school soon enough bridge tuck in that lip before you loose it
5108798 so far the knee has been good so hell be evaluated monday and well make a decision
5108799 every time we got to just bp it seemed to blow up but it has not happened this time he seems to be healthy and hes running well so were encouraged by it
5108800 because if we run around the outfield hes obviously got a chance to pull up hurting a lot easier
5108801 weve had some trouble trying to keep the swelling out of it but hes done everything this time everything that we need him to do and it hasnt been a problem
5108802 i wasnt worried about how many wins i was getting i was just trying to get a spot in the rotation and stay there
5108803 i was hoping id be important to the club that id have a role like ive had in the past coming off last year and the way things were setting up in spring training youre not really sure the way its going to be
5108804 but weve had some injuries and the young guys struggled and got hurt so me and andy pettitte are the two old guys that have been going out there and hopefully we can just keep going
5108805 twenty wins will come if he continues to pitch the way hes pitching joe girardi said
5108806 hes throwing the ball great been really consistent locates changes speeds and hes in a nice groove
5108807 a technically challenging profession that pays its entry people as much as us 50 000 year is an interesting one system administration appears to be a fine way to make a living experience education and enhanced skillsets seem to be the growth path of choice
5108808 beyond the cable shows other audiences that pay particularly close attention to national news include readers of magazines such as the atlantic harpers magazine and the new yorker rush limbaugh listeners npr listeners and those who regularly watch the newshour with jim lehrer or the network sunday morning news programs
5108809 the nice thing about homeschooling is that you can study whatever you want
5108810 it is plain and simple attitude plays a big part in this game you have got to turn up each week
5108811 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5108812 the number of gps systems being stolen is astounding and what makes it more concerning is that this is a preventable crime
5108813 historically public services were delivered by the man from the ministry who was white and heterosexual and got the 4 30 pm train back to tunbridge wells every afternoon
5108814 this move by mi5 is recognition that the establishment is changing and slowly becoming more reflective of wider society
5108815 the way the games are falling the sides that needed to win did win and were one of those sides
5108816 were not a side that can be complacent about anything you guys talk us up and we talk ourselves down
5108817 it keeps us up there with three games to go theres six points to go and hopefully we can get them
5108818 ive been eating my mums lasagne two nights before the game for the last 10 years so it might just be kicking in i guess
5108819 over the last few years ive played a good game and then had a few bad games but this year ive been more consistent people seem to see that more when you play consistent football and thats why everyone is giving me a few raps
5108820 would guests seated in rows 15 to 30 please use the rear stairs and keep on the guidepath and follow all instructions given to you by the ground crew thank you
5108821 we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
5108822 ive been trying to reconcile the app store with my beliefs on
5108823 people always say money cant buy happiness and i always believed that but a little part of me thought that a whole lot of money could buy just a little happiness i was wrong
5108824 to be to 16 in august thats a rarity for me
5108825 ive been doing some things right ive been getting a few breaks the bullpen has been really good behind me the guys are scoring me runs weve been playing solid defense you need all those things to work for you
5108826 why a blog with comments would be treated differently from say a bbs or a chat room escapes me
5108827 wenn porsche sich nicht bewegt und zusagt dass es nderungen in diesen punkten gibt dann wird es keine friedensgipfel geben
5108828 wir konzentrieren uns jetzt erst mal auf den rechtsweg und den erhalt unseres vw gesetzes

5108830 ironically iraq may yet prove to be the source of our salvation
5108831 oh man i have to learn how to make a podcast today i dont even know what a podcast is
5108832 i imagine that someday soon the stuff from this class will be so last week but it has gotten me into the practice of trying new stuff and trying to use it for other purposes
5108833 describing him as a professional diligent employee of high integrity
5108834 it simply took for granted that the students felt they had been racially discriminated against it was not interested in what mr williamson had to say about the matter
5108835 an allegation that one is racist or discriminates against others is a very serious allegation failing to investigate such a serious allegation fully and fairly was a very serious breach of duty
5108836 by their own actions the jews have cursed themselves to forever wander the earth in shame until they repent and convert from the evil talmudic religion
5108837 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5108838 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5108839 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5108840 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5108841 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5108842 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5108843 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike
5108844 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
5108845 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
5108846 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
5108847 remain s confident of growing our profitability in the current financial year
5108848 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said
5108849 growth in the australian and new zealand employment business has been driven by ongoing migration from print to online a growing presence in sme healthcare education and government markets improved yield and the introduction of product extensions through standout amp premium ads
5108850 more than 77 per cent of job seekers time is now spent on seek and over the past 12 months we have increased job ad volumes by more than our two closest competitors combined
5108851 with increased sales capability and new content partnerships seek learning had a strong second half and with continued leverage of the seek brand we expect this momentum to continue paul bassat said
5108852 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5108853 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5108854 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not
5108855 if you have a patient from cheshire they have a very good record most of the time we apply to cheshire they tend to fund patients that have exceptional circumstances if we apply to the manchester primary care trust then in the eight applications weve made theyve only accepted one for funding in 2006
5108856 i was losing my balance my ears were tingling my hands and feet tingled i couldnt drive because i had double vision
5108857 the medications that are available and the medications we are looking at are trying to cure these relapses and the changes that occur on the mri
5108858 if something happens you are immediately seen and they check up on you a lot
5108859 we think we only need to spend 500 on a device
5108860 i should underline the fact these are high quality new generation devices that are in prototype at the moment we would be one of the largest single computer purchasers in the world
5108861 people come to new zealand and dont understand just how fast the weather can change
5108862 they are extremely lucky to be alive in the circumstances the chances of the rescue party finding six corpses were at least as high as finding six live people
5108863 we were totally at the mercy of the mountain its great to be finally home
5108864 we certainly didnt talk at least not out loud about the possibility of not making it off the mountain
5108865 but i think we all knew that it was a very dangerous situation
5108866 apart from the fact it was freezing and wet we were just having a conversation like you would with friends in a pub
5108867 we talked about childhood our favourite fast foods our school days our favourite places and our adventures
5108868 not crowded with other people new zealand press agency nzpa reported
5108869 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mt isa
5108870 quite often youll see walking down the street a lass who isnt so attractive with a wide smile
5108871 what the f call a spade a spade you mean ugly
5108872 we have heard from a person but we dont know if he is the pilot or not
5108873 this person has contacted police but he has not left any contact details
5108874 the way they used the numbers 30 years ago is not the way they register them today
5108875 these societies have historically rooted disadvantages in competing in a capitalist world
5108876 their response to market incentives can be limited this may explain the extraordinary difficulty forager groups such as australian aboriginals have had in successfully incorporating into capitalism
5108877 its far better to set some ambitious goals even if from time to time you fall short
5108878 ive been talking up hill and down dale for many years about the scourge of welfare and the deep need for our people to engage in the opportunities of australias incredible economy
5108879 cdep is one hell of a weapon to take aboriginal peoples rights
5108880 its a killer its worse than bashing women its worse than bashing children its worse than drugs i would like to take every dollar of cdep and build a training school and give skills to our people for their future
5108881 ive canvassed particularly the leaders and in many cases the owners of those companies and what ive found myself pushing against is an open door
5108882 place based initiatives predicated on participatory consultations and in a careful matching of aspirations for engagement with all productive sectors of the economy with local and regional opportunity
5108883 i suppose the big question mark is will there be 50 000 takers and the answer to that question will depend on the indigenous community of australia who are crying out for jobs but it will require us to make hard decisions about taking up welfare reform getting off welfare and into the real economy
5108884 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5108885 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5108886 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5108887 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5108888 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5108889 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5108890 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5108891 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5108892 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5108893 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5108894 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5108895 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5108896 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5108897 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5108898 the physical layer is still quite a challenge even worldwide people spend a lot of money on the other layers but the physical layer is neglected its an ongoing educational process
5108899 as time goes by we also have more and more live working sites in the middle east which builds confidence and we see that reflected in the increase in tender requests we are receiving for our product
5108900 we also offer demonstrations of the product and have a raft of facts and figures to show the value added benefits of the product
5108901 labour is relatively cheap here so enterprises are not always concerned about the cost in labour the software can save them developments being delayed is also proving a headache as we are often times directly tied into the parts of the building that are delayed
5108902 some contractors just try to squeeze the margins and so enterprises end up with either a bad product and a good installer or visa versa its down to education again end users and consultants alike need to be educated
5108903 it was pretty haphazard and the standing joke in the industry was that most documentation was on the back of cigarette packets
5108904 the reality is that wherever you find structured cabling there is a need for documentation the speed with which it gains traction and is adopted does however differ from region to region worldover
5108905 we have been in the region before with our previous product crimp so there is a certain amount of background users are still a little nervous but we are addressing those fears
5108906 im a dude playin a dude disguised as another dude
5108907 theres nothing wrong with giving up so long as what youre giving is good and youre not giving it in too upward a direction
5108908 when live gives you lemons dont put them into a story nobody needs those kind of lemons
5108909 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest he told abc radio today
5108910 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5108911 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations she told abc radio
5108912 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5108913 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5108914 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars
5108915 les chars russes dans les rues des villes g orgiennes nous rappellent

5108922 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5108923 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being c p at everything with no discernible talent
5108924 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia
5108925 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
5108926 in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements
5108927 this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to ties his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5108928 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
5108929 important clarity and certainty by a critically important us court
5108930 here are two brother countries united like a single fist
5108931 supported the country in its current struggle against the united states
5108932 only a coalition of marxists and islamists can destroy the united states
5108933 america is worse than britain britain is worse than america and the soviet union is worse than both of them each one is worse than the other each one is more abominable than the other but today we are concerned with this malicious entity which is america
5108934 the past four decades championing the very freedoms that islam most opposes sexual and reproductive freedoms gay rights freedom from religion pornography and various forms of artistic transgression pacifism and so on
5108935 islam depends on community which places it in opposition to extreme individualism which threatens to fail in the west in addition the devout muslim is required to share his wealth with others the leftist also wants to see the strong help the weak
5108936 the progressive movement around the world and the muslims have the same enemies
5108937 the government practically permitted the left to operate since five years ago so that they would confront religious liberals
5108938 takes its language goals and aspirations as much from the crassest forms of marxism as it does from religion its leaders are as influenced by lenin sartre stalin and fanon as they are by the prophet
5108939 they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system
5108940 a godsend to both sides the left a once dwindling band of communists trotskyites maoists and castroists had been clinging to the dregs of a clapped out cause the islamists could deliver numbers and passion but they needed a vehicle to give them purchase on the political terrain a tactical alliance became an operational imperative
5108941 the practical benefits of working together are enough to compensate for the differences
5108942 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
5108943 we will never forget her and we will never stop until this person is in prison
5108944 were looking for closure which means finding the person who did this
5108945 we know that she was alone sitting on her back porch
5108946 she was just seen by a neighbor and that was it that was the last time she was seen
5108947 its going to be one lead one small thing that will crack this wide open for law enforcement
5108948 this is going to come down to somebody who didnt even know that they had that tiny little piece that authorities were looking for
5108949 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
5108950 im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore

5108959 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5108960 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5108961 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5108962 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5108963 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5108964 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5108965 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5108966 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5108967 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5108968 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5108969 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5108970 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5108971 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5108972 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5108973 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5108974 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5108975 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5108976 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5108977 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5108978 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5108979 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5108980 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5108981 who are open to doing something on the production side
5108982 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5108983 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5108984 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5108985 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5108986 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5108987 do not go against the law those who do will be dealt with accordingly
5108988 the situation in permatang pauh is under control and at the moment we do not need additional manpower the 3 000 strong force deployed there is sufficient to maintain peace and order
5108989 however we will consider sending more men if and when the need arises
5108990 we need the victims to co operate with the police so that we can nab the culprits the police cant act solely based on media reports
5108991 it is not a sign of weakness not to respond to aggression we are concerned about the safety of all malaysians voters must vote in peace
5108992 this issue should be viewed objectively after the federal government opened the mara junior science colleges to non bumiputeras in 2000 we got very good feedback
5108993 dont jump the gun accuse us and put us down if there is proof that our people were involved they will not be protected
5108994 hey we can rip that off i mean pay homage to it
5108995 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
5108996 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
5108997 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice

5109003 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5109004 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5109005 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place
5109006 well its good that you encourage the public to vote that has to be the first step
5109007 peoples power exists only collectively acting together collective responsibility is one spur to collective action otherwise we get what many germans did under hitler enjoy the benefits then deny responsibility when things end badly
5109008 if one tries to rebuild neighborhoods walk the precincts get the vote out and otherwise work within the system the plutocrats will skim all the profits out of the system and all your effort will merely serve to enrich your enemies
5109009 reform efforts repeatedly failed in frances ancien regime leading to the bloody french revolution and the dictatorship of napoleon
5109010 all the discussions ive had and the mri i had before were that its my flexor tendon
5109011 the soreness i have now is the same soreness i had then
5109012 why not the winner is exactly the age i will be then and there is no reason why i cant go on to london and maybe just maybe get that medal
5109013 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
5109014 i would have walked because it was something that was actually okay walking i havent made the injury worse
5109015 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the
5109016 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
5109017 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
5109018 a pain came up into my calves it wasnt a sharp pain if it had been like when the
5109019 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5109020 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the well need more than this
5109021 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5109022 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5109023 im happy with anelka i said to him you will have three or four chances you need to make one or two goals for me and for the people i want people to believe in you more than before
5109024 theyll go away for a few days now to the national team thats frustrating but this is a
5109025 well have six or seven players at training and start building some ideas for the game against wigan well hope the others get back in condition and well be ready
5109026 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at so you start forgetting about them the top four are on another level
5109027 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them ive had good backing terrific backing to bring in
5109028 historically public services were delivered by the man from the ministry who was white and heterosexual and got the 4 30 pm train back to tunbridge wells every afternoon
5109029 this move by mi5 is recognition that the establishment is changing and slowly becoming more reflective of wider society
5109030 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5109031 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5109032 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5109033 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5109034 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5109035 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5109036 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5109037 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5109038 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5109039 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5109040 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5109041 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5109042 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for
5109043 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5109044 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that
5109045 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5109046 brandon gorins shoulder injury is a little more severe than originally diagnosed
5109047 it was not misdiagnosis they were continuing to study the mri and those things and he has a pretty significant shoulder injury it is real similar to what tackle orlando pace had so it is an injury that will force him out for the year
5109048 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5109049 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5109050 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5109051 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5109052 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5109053 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5109054 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5109055 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5109056 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5109057 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5109058 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5109059 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5109060 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5109061 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5109062 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5109063 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5109064 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5109065 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5109066 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5109067 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5109068 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5109069 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5109070 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5109071 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5109072 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5109073 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5109074 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5109075 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5109076 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5109077 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5109078 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5109079 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5109080 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5109081 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5109082 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5109101 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest he told abc radio today
5109102 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5109103 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations she told abc radio
5109104 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5109105 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5109106 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars
5109107 what this does is it shifts the incentives in favour of playing by the rules and having access to a job year after year

5109110 i was in debt 7500 and i earned over 90 000 net
5109111 as i have it myself i could cope with it but i wondered what another teacher who doesnt know would have done
5109112 its something that i think is a unique and interesting part of our history
5109113 ive certainly asked for some work to be done about what the possible costs might be and what sort of assistance we might be able to provide
5109114 i spoke about this earlier this year in parliament it is i think a little known part of queenslands wartime history
5109115 he has managed to totally out flank his rival barak obama during what was supposed to be an intense period of obama watching before obama announced his own vp mccain has shoved him aside with this announcement this was truly a masterful time to announce his vp selection
5109116 i figure bigfoot has a several strong positives and just a few weaker negatives
5109117 he is a strong vital character which any vp of john mccain must be he is also a political outsider which should help mccain with voters suspicious of his long inside the beltway career the only negatives are that he is a bit on an unknown and his speaking style is a bit gruff to be a great communicator in the television age but i have to say that on the whole i think he is a solid choice
5109118 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5109119 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5109120 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5109121 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5109122 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5109123 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5109124 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5109125 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5109126 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5109129 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5109130 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5109131 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5109132 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5109133 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5109134 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

5109145 these are interesting times for universities we simply cannot afford to lose this time
5109146 we were given some crockery by the wife ann pettigrew
5109147 he had a look at the dinner set then one of his assistants counted all of the items
5109148 mr cassidy said professor pettigrews outstanding background in research and senior management would assist him in guiding une through a period of increasingly insistent financial imperatives for universities
5109149 whether you are selling fish and chips construction or education the business is the same
5109150 mr cassidy obviously has some sort of backing on council or they would have paid attention to the last vote that we had
5109151 the university was really keen to get the pictures out there

5109174 the dreamy bittersweet world of margot amp the nuclear so and sos is the brainchild of singer songwriter richard edwards in 2004 he formed the eight piece indie rock collective in his native indianapolis naming the band after the margot tenenbaum character in wes andersons sophisticated comedy the royal tenenbaums the bands debut album the dust of retreat was issued on standard in spring 2005 the picturesque dozen song set is themed around the musicians own fancies of greenwich village in the 1960s playfully ironic the modest edwards has also admitted to critics that the bandmembers aim to play how they feel when theyre watching woody allen films in november 2005 margot amp the nuclear so and sos signed with artemis records a remixed and remastered version of the dust of retreat was released in march 2006 and the band relocated to the epic roster while working on their sophomore release the following year
5109175 the thing thats most rewarding here is what can be learned about what ive done
5109176 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams im hoping that people out there that may have thought they were too old to do certain things can realize theyre not
5109177 shes truly remarkable she gives me hope for another 20 years
5109178 she actually was talking about childbirth in the ready room
5109179 she thought swimming is tough but she said childbirth is harder
5109180 shes done a fantastic job proving that women can have children and still compete at a high level
5109181 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5109182 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5109183 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5109184 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5109185 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5109186 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling
5109187 doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods
5109188 second place is obviously tough to swallow right now but ill probably be pretty happy here when i realize ive got a job for the rest of the year
5109189 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there
5109190 i didnt want to have four weeks off you know and im glad at least i got into the first one
5109191 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5109192 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the offseason i know what to work on for next year
5109193 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5109194 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already
5109195 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5109196 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5109197 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 today
5109198 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5109199 i got a little lucky he moved to the other side
5109200 after that ace i felt very relaxed it was a very good sensation
5109201 it got better in the second set but it still wasnt great
5109202 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5109203 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me
5109204 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5109205 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5109206 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off

5109209 aimst university is a symbol and testament to the fact that malaysians of all races can stand united as one
5109210 given this noble goal and aimst universitys vision to become a leading regional university the government would continue to support its mission
5109211 it was disappointing i think in the first half we played pretty well our attacking play was very good ferguson told sky sports
5109212 but in the second half we never looked like breaking them down
5109213 we were the better team but we didnt make it count
5109214 i said to the lads if we can come here and do that we can go anywhere after a game like that
5109215 i dont want to be sacked but maybe it is one line that chelsea will follow because at chelsea if you dont win it is bad
5109216 i have a contract for two years and i will try and stay two years but its true nobody remembers a loser
5109217 most of chinas competitors fully displayed their abilities to realise the goal of achieving good results on home soil
5109218 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5109219 generally speaking chinas athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games
5109220 with events like track and field starting chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5109221 yes we gave out money but it is merely for our party election machinery workers
5109222 nothing is free nowadays they are paid for helping us out during the campaigning
5109223 in fact paying them just rm10 a day is not enough to cover costs
5109224 they are good at using such dirty tactics they even say that we have been telling the voters not to give anwar the votes and that they should stay at home on aug 26 as he will surely win the election
5109225 it is just a token of appreciation for their hard work
5109226 we lie to each other so much that in nothing we trust
5109227 preach the gospel at all times and if necessary use words
5109228 it is not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5109229 stand violently on our behalf so that we can sleep soundly in our beds
5109230 no greater love has a man than this that he would lay down his life for a friend

5109232 come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light matthew 11 28 30
5109233 he was wounded for bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed
5109234 if god is such a loving and great god why is there so much evil in this world
5109235 and free will is what has made evil possible why then did god give them free will because free will through it makes evil possible is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having a world of automata of creatures that worked like machines would hardly be worth creating the happiness which god designs for his higher creatures is the happiness of being freely voluntarily united to him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and woman on this earth is mere milk and water and for that they must be free
5109236 i was named volunteer of the year for the past 3 years by meals on wheels

5109238 in the most extreme cases of this patients are really not leaving their house much
5109239 they just kind of assume people are judging them negatively
5109240 students studying at corporate intermediate colleges face an imprisoned atmosphere pressure for time humiliation of under performance and comparison with other students often result in ever increasing stress levels even students with good performance are pressured with an eye on ranks stay in hostel worsens the situation as the students are literally robbed of their freedom of expression
5109241 expectations are irrationally high and social pressure adds up to it it is as if without excellence there is no life
5109242 by the time a child reaches six to seven years of age his or her personality is formed by way of childhood experiences it determines how the child reacts in a given situation social expectations financial benefits and parental ambitions all put together exercise artificial pressure
5109243 they made a fuss i came all the way from ajit singh nagar to take part in the celebrations

5109263 theres only so much they can do to stay competitive and we dont get too riled up over the fees
5109264 if were going to fly were going to fly and whatever it is it is it wouldnt prevent us from going where we want to go

5109268 sure it was funny but did they have to use so much bad language
5109269 i am sorry but i had no answer to lin dans play today yesterday he was almost perfect and i know i was disappointing but i just couldnt cope with his speed
5109270 i tried to take control but as much as i did i couldnt this is the easiest i have lost to lin dan his 10th defeat in 15 meetings but this is because he was totally in charge
5109271 i will go on but i wont talk about the london olympics just yet my focus is on the 2010 asian games and we will see after that
5109272 yes i am the olympic and world champion but there is still so much to achieve i must emulate taufik hidayat who also won the asian games gold
5109273 my performance was good because i was desperate to win i knew that i couldnt let chong wei take control and i followed my gameplan
5109274 i didnt get beyond 82 metres but im very happy i said before the competition i would be the first slovenian athlete to get a gold medal and i did just that
5109275 i wanted more you always want more but it was enough for gold
5109276 it makes up for the world championships last year when i was leading right up until the final throw
5109277 my last throw gave me a good chance but im a little disappointed
5109278 i knew my second throw was good i kept trying but i just couldnt get the distance
5109279 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5109280 my coach and i we went to the coffee shop and we met the boy who won the 100m who gave me a bunch of flowers
5109281 he told me these flowers are transferable if i took them i must win gold and then pass them on to someone else
5109282 i feel bad that it didnt go well i gave it my all but i want to feel that i didnt let my family down he promised his mother after the athens final he would deliver gold in beijing i gave everything i had
5109283 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect
5109284 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mum
5109285 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
5109286 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
5109287 sullivan came back at the end but i think at the end of a long competition we are all a little tired right now
5109288 in the first 20 metres i noticed dara torres beside me
5109289 my coach told me the last 10 metres would decide the results
5109290 im thinking i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
5109291 they have all said that they contested on bn tickets and would remain with us so where is anwars credibility as a leader

5109296 all the other laras have been great but this is the first time they have got someone who not only looks good but can do all the action moves as well
5109297 im taking lara to a new level you could say my mission is to become the real life lara croft i would like to think i am the best one yet angelina might disagree though ideally i would love to do a film that would be absolutely amazing angelina is great but if she cant do it im more than ready to step into those boots for her
5109298 im not scared of becoming a sex symbol or the thought of getting lots of male attention but lara doesnt really have any time for men and it seems im also going to be too busy from now on it doesnt really matter as most men cant keep up with me anyway
5109299 if i were running al qaeda in iraq i would put a circle around march 2008 and pray as many times as possible for a victory not only for obama but also for the democrats
5109300 i would also note that we have close to 140 000 troops on the ground now and my understanding is that mr howard has deployed 1400 mr obama who next year could become the first african american to be elected us president said
5109301 so if hes ginned up to fight the good fight in iraq i would suggest he calls up another 20 000 australians and sends them up to iraq
5109302 if i were running al qaeda in iraq i would put a circle around march 2008 and pray as many times as possible for a victory not only for obama but also for the democrats
5109303 i would also note that we have close to 140 000 troops on the ground now and my understanding is that mr howard has deployed 1400 mr obama who next year could become the first african american to be elected us president said

5109310 everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which god has established the authorities that exist have been established by god consequently he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what god has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves
5109311 my whole squad are veterans from the last deployment and its good i have those guys to ask questions with and back me up
5109312 sixty five years ago i said goodbye to my parents my brother and sister my loved ones so im well aware of the emotions that run through you the sadness and anxiety
5109313 but please know that your service to our nation and our state is deeply appreciated
5109314 were expecting it to be safer although it will be in a larger area and will have more unknowns
5109315 when i felt all that warmth and love that she gave me i wanted to share it with all
5109316 it was great and exciting because i actually accomplished my dream im so proud of myself
5109317 obviously it was bad enough to come off yesterday and with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours for them to settle or get worse
5109318 hes got a big flight we have to manage it to ensure he gets plenty of ice on it on the way home if we keep the swelling down then he shouldnt be out for too long
5109319 they appear to be better today than they were yesterday so its encouraging
5109320 we wont know until we get home how he is
5109321 therefore with the growth of technology the human race is faced with tremendous crisis
5109322 so the kind of thought thats going on all around us begins to take over in every one of us without our even knowing it

5109326 my son if you accept my words and store up my commands within you turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure then you will understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
5109327 a good father does these basic things provides for his family protects his family and gives spiritual and moral guidance
5109328 my son if you accept my words and store up my commands within you turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure then you will understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
5109329 if you accept my words and store up my commands
5109330 i have hidden your word in my heart that i might not sin against you
5109331 do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says
5109332 there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined
5109333 a loving reverence for god that includes submission to his lordship and to the commands of his word
5109334 now all has been heard here is the conclusion of the matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god will bring every deed into judgment including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil
5109335 and my name is to be feared among the nations
5109336 god understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells
5109337 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that man should not think he will receive anything from the lord he is a double minded man unstable in all he does
5109338 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
5109339 surely the arm of the lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear but your iniquities have separated you from your god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear
5109340 then you will understand what is right and just and fair every good path for wisdom will enter your heart and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul discretion will protect you and understanding will guard you
5109341 his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness through these he has given us his very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires
5109342 wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men from men whose words are perverse who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways
5109343 for you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do living in debauchery lust drunkenness orgies carousing and detestable idolatry they think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation and they heap abuse on you but they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead
5109344 it will save you also from the adulteress from the wayward wife with her seductive words who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before god for her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead none who go to her return or attain the paths of life
5109345 my son pay attention to my wisdom listen well to my words of insight that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge
5109346 how i hated discipline how my heart spurned correction i would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors i have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly
5109347 i find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains the man who pleases god will escape her but the sinner she will ensnare

5109350 thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous for the upright will live in the land and the blameless will remain in it but the wicked will be cut off from the land and the unfaithful will be torn from it
5109351 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realise im olympic champion

5109367 ninety percent of patients with huntingtons disease have chorea and many suffer terribly its hard to describe the torment that these people undergo we had several patients who experienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life some patients who hadnt been able to attend church for years were able to do so others were able to go out to a restaurant and have a meal for the first time in years its impossible to over emphasize what this has meant to some patients who are able to reclaim part of the life that they have lost due to this disease
5109368 patients and families with huntingtons disease maintain a courageous hope for progress
5109369 on one hand the fda approval of tetrabenazine represents only a small step forward this medication helps patients control their movements better but is not known to slow the underlying progression of the disease on the other hand the fda approval represents a giant symbolic breakthrough since tetrabenazine is the first drug ever approved in the united states for any aspect of huntingtons disease it is an honor to be part of the extended community of patients families and researchers trying to find a better way forward
5109370 my mother and many others have died without the benefits of tetrabenazine
5109371 since the medication was invented in the 1950s worldwide it has been give to close to a million people we have a tremendous amount of information about its benefits potential side effects how to treat the side effects and dosing suggestions this is day to celebrate for huntingtons patients and their families

5109389 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5109390 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5109391 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5109392 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict

5109396 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5109397 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5109398 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5109399 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5109400 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5109401 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5109402 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions

5109406 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5109407 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5109408 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5109409 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5109410 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5109411 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5109412 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5109413 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5109414 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5109415 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5109416 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5109417 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5109418 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5109419 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5109420 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5109421 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5109422 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5109423 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5109424 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5109425 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5109426 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5109427 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5109428 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5109429 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

5109444 those pirates went on to film the pirates of penzance not really pirates just like cop rock not really cops power rangers you guessed it real life gay ninjas so we do have a clear cut winner again
5109445 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5109446 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5109447 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5109448 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5109449 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5109450 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5109451 this is a planning took where all things are going
5109452 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5109453 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5109454 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5109455 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5109456 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5109457 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5109458 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5109459 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5109460 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5109461 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5109462 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5109463 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5109464 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5109465 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5109466 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5109467 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5109468 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5109469 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5109470 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5109471 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5109472 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5109473 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5109474 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5109475 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5109476 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5109477 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5109478 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5109479 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5109480 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5109481 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5109482 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5109483 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5109484 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5109485 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5109486 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5109487 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5109488 the views expressed above are those of the poster and not those of multiplay uk
5109489 im extremely pleased with the sea eagle se330 inflatable kayak i have used in in my local lake as well as the river and canal it tracks very well in large bodies of water and is easy to steer in small water ways i recommend it highly to all and receive many compliments and interest whenever i use it thanks for a great product
5109490 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
5109491 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
5109492 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
5109493 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
5109494 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
5109495 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price
5109496 the pressure absorbing box spring mcroskey continues to build a true box spring essential for total comfort unlike most other box springs which are essentially covered platforms our box spring is built with pressure absorbing comfort using strong steel coils individually fastened to a well designed hardwood frame that is insulated with materials to prevent the box spring from squeaking
5109497 had the black community simply not been so bigoted someone would have taught me about condom use and i would have been provided access to them by a person who reached out to me as a gay man rather than shunning be because of their hatred of my life style
5109498 the threat of a ground attack i believe proved decisive
5109499 i told them in london youre going to send me back to the usa without my daughters
5109500 i got to the uk and they shut me down they put a flare on my passport with a travel restriction and put me in a puppy chow compound

5109508 i must be very honest with myself it is one thing to say i am capable and quite another for the grassroots to overcome the gender angle some of them have told me they have no problem with my capabilities but have a little problem that i am a woman
5109509 i give her all my blessings she is one of many groomed to take over the leadership of wanita mca

5109518 im getting a lot of pressure from my constituents to do something about those 30 guys standing on the street all the time
5109519 i got an e mail from a lady that lives on the west end of alabama drive talking about how scared she was how afraid she was to go out at night or to go out during the daytime because of the men just hanging out people shouldnt have to live like that
5109520 were going to monitor events and were frankly concerned that the day laborers civil rights will be violated
5109521 the placement or location of the victim coupled with the methodology of the criminal activity is an essential part of law enforcement understanding
5109522 ice united states immigration and customs enforcement is terrorizing hispanic neighborhoods
5109523 if you are here illegally keep a low profile and obey all of this nations laws
5109524 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5109525 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5109526 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5109527 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5109528 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5109529 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5109530 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5109531 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5109532 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5109533 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5109534 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5109535 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5109536 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5109537 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5109538 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5109539 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5109540 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5109541 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5109542 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5109543 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5109544 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5109545 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5109546 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5109547 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5109548 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5109549 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5109550 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5109551 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5109552 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5109553 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5109554 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5109555 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5109556 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5109557 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5109558 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5109559 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5109560 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5109561 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5109562 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5109563 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5109564 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there the same answer would be toward this situation
5109565 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond home depot and the solution is certainly more complicated than placing mandates on businesses
5109566 all of this is flying in the face of what the city is supposed to be doing in terms of upholding the law
5109567 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5109568 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5109569 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5109570 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5109571 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5109572 i think hes acknowledged that military action in this particular situation is unlikely but as commander in chief he wants to make sure all options remain available to him and thats understandable
5109573 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5109574 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8
5109575 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war
5109576 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues
5109577 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5109578 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5109579 the surge has been singularly or at least very predominantly one of the main reasons for the turnaround in the war
5109580 senator mccain saw that the need for it because of his judgment his experience and wisdom senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge thats a startling lack of judgment in my view
5109581 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5109582 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times
5109583 the problem is first of all that the russian president has given his word several times and its not been honored by russian troops so i assume that this time russian forces are indeed going to withdraw
5109584 president bush has offered an opportunity for russia to behave as a partner offered an opportunity for russia to make a strategic choice in favor of integration into the international economic political diplomatic security structures made an opportunity for russia to finally act like a 21st century modern power
5109585 and i do think that russian behavior calls seriously into question whether russia is prepared to make that choice
5109586 in fact russia seems to want to have it both ways it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order and on the other hand it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors both cant be true
5109587 all the united states has done is encouraged democratic government in georgia encouraged market based economic reforms encouraged fight against corruption and encouraged the georgians to look towards the modern institutions of the west
5109588 the united states and georgia have had a very good relationship this is a pro western pro european government that wants to be a part of those institutions
5109589 as to this particular conflict we have encouraged georgians and all parties to resolve this conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia peacefully we have supported peace plans we have supported diplomacy we have told all parties not to get involved in military conflict
5109590 georgia of course has been a state that has been westward looking has been a friend of ours we have indicated to them through cultural exchanges and other exchanges that we want to be supportive of them
5109591 but i havent seen any evidence that the united states of america has overpromised and when you look at the reactions of the two candidates senator mccain senator obama senator mccain came out saying you know this really is bullying behavior by russia against one of our friends the state of georgia senator obamas statement came out and essentially implied that were going to equally blame our friend georgia and russia and then he revised his statement two or three times but again it shows a lack of surefootedness by senator obama
5109592 let us not forget that barack obama has been calling for a resolution of these disputes for many many months now long before hostilities broke out
5109593 if we followed his advice perhaps we wouldnt be talking about this here today if the president and senator mccain werent so obsessed on an open ended commitment to iraq perhaps we would have paid greater attention to some of these issues
5109594 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5109595 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5109596 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5109597 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5109598 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5109599 we need this inclusive government to drive the process of addressing those challenges
5109600 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5109601 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5109602 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5109603 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5109604 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5109605 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5109606 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5109607 theres not a single person who ought to feel good that we are in here dealing with these issues
5109608 if anyone thinks theyre going to walk out of here thinking they won anything they dont understand this case or either side of the issues
5109609 dont even think about a sea eagle 330 without this deluxe kayak seat the sec canoe seats found in the sea eagle 330 deluxe option package provide very little back support we would never consider a day on the water with the sec canoe seats its like a day skiing with cold and uncomfortable ski boots ouch
5109610 im extremely pleased with the sea eagle se330 inflatable kayak i have used in in my local lake as well as the river and canal it tracks very well in large bodies of water and is easy to steer in small water ways i recommend it highly to all and receive many compliments and interest whenever i use it thanks for a great product i am writing to praise the sea eagle 330 i used to paddle 700 miles of the mackenzie river in the wilderness of canadas northwest territories i encountered smooth water and whitecaps clear skies and rain sand and more often than not coarse gravel stones and splintered driftwood on the banks my sea eagle performed splendidly in every hazard i could not avoid i enthusiastically endorse this inflatable canoe for wilderness travel the sea eagle 330 has been absolutely perfect when we leave we fold it up and store in an rv compartment with a variety of display boats to chose from most costing hundreds more i pull out the 330 and a deluxe kayak seat when i have to get into a remote fishing lake with the sea eagle 330 under one arm and fishing pole in the other this little boat gets me out where the fish are biting specifications exterior 11 2
5109611 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days
5109612 but the fearful and unbelieving shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone

5109659 dont even think about a sea eagle 330 without this deluxe kayak seat the sec canoe seats found in the sea eagle 330 deluxe option package provide very little back support we would never consider a day on the water with the sec canoe seats its like a day skiing with cold and uncomfortable ski boots ouch
5109660 im extremely pleased with the sea eagle se330 inflatable kayak i have used in in my local lake as well as the river and canal it tracks very well in large bodies of water and is easy to steer in small water ways i recommend it highly to all and receive many compliments and interest whenever i use it thanks for a great product i am writing to praise the sea eagle 330 i used to paddle 700 miles of the mackenzie river in the wilderness of canadas northwest territories i encountered smooth water and whitecaps clear skies and rain sand and more often than not coarse gravel stones and splintered driftwood on the banks my sea eagle performed splendidly in every hazard i could not avoid i enthusiastically endorse this inflatable canoe for wilderness travel the sea eagle 330 has been absolutely perfect when we leave we fold it up and store in an rv compartment with a variety of display boats to chose from most costing hundreds more i pull out the 330 and a deluxe kayak seat when i have to get into a remote fishing lake with the sea eagle 330 under one arm and fishing pole in the other this little boat gets me out where the fish are biting specifications exterior 11 2

5109664 he is a star of the future and i was more than happy to use him at this level
5109665 i would say it will be the first of many group winners for him
5109666 i really want to get some opportunities in the spring and hopefully this will be the start of something
5109667 we looked at this race four weeks ago hoping that she princess gisella would get a soft track because she revels in the going
5109668 the 1200 metres was way too short but she kicked off her campaign and hit the line going forward
5109669 after the autumn i still thought gold ace was the best i had raced
5109670 but looking at yesterday id have to say light fantastic is the best ive raced and mick price says he is the best he has trained
5109671 at the 650 metre mark he was off the bit and then he wobbled on the corner
5109672 one of these days hell get rolled and the cox plate is the goal
5109673 he ticked one box yesterday but there is still a long way to go
5109674 moonee valley and the soft tracks are his go for sure
5109675 it looks a nice race for him on saturday and im very happy with him
5109676 we will just make sure he doesnt race on hard tracks again even if we think he can win
5109677 we have got him back and now we are looking forward to the mcewen
5109678 if he was a maiden you wouldnt bother with him but we know he has a such a big motor
5109679 there is remedial work being done in a couple of places near the 1600 metre mark
5109680 the local fossicking club went over the course with metal detectors and picked up about 80 horseshoes 80 in coins tent pegs and an 1870 penny and we are confident they found everything
5109681 we will take another look at it tomorrow and then on thursday we will hopefully be able to sign off on it and the trainers and horses can return on sunday
5109682 the course proper is a bit hard and there may have to be a little water put on it during the week
5109683 admittedly his first run back was only over 1200 metres but i really felt he could have won this time
5109684 i know hes a lot better than that i wanted to see him find the line
5109685 id say his trip away is in doubt now but i might back him up next week before we decide
5109686 i started training in taree when i was about 20 and we used to take horses to sydney
5109687 i used to do a lot of show jumping and ive been at the gold coast now for two years
5109688 i want to run him fastnstraight in the taree cup on sunday hell stay all day
5109689 theres plenty of cup races coming up the lismore cup is coming up next month and then theres the wyong cup
5109690 she has done a good job and shes only lightly framed so well put her away and bring her back for something over the autumn
5109691 the plan is to give her the chance to have a crack at some black type we think she has earned that opportunity
5109692 one of the most pleasing aspects of her performance yesterday is that she ran just 11 of a second slower than the liston stakes and her last 600 metres was quicker than light fantastic the winner of that race
5109693 she has relished the step up in distance and the soft surfaces
5109694 in time i would like to tackle a mid week race in town but for the time being i will just sit down and have a good look at what is coming up before i make a decision
5109695 its very disappointing weve had a series of issues with him and weve had to pull the pin
5109696 he just jarred up a few times and it wasnt worth risking anything with him spring is gone and hell have three months off
5109697 this horse gave me my greatest moment as a trainer and my worst

5109731 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5109732 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5109733 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5109734 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5109735 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5109736 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet

5109738 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world
5109739 if youre going to make a difference youve got to do it big
5109740 i do think that to be changing in the middle of the stream can be very inconvenient not only for the institutions but for the students
5109741 my heart does go out to the children who if you came here at the age of two or three with your parents and you had no say so about whats going on and youve gone through our public schools to say you cant attend a community college i have a problem with that
5109742 we dont ask that question directly in our admission process but there are indicators that would give us reasons to ask for more information
5109743 our alternative was to have a knee jerk reaction to all of this
5109744 and so rather than continue and possibly risk flip flopping lets maintain the status quo get our study done and come out with a well reasoned policy
5109745 we were shocked that the person whos running for governor as an education proponent would deny so many youths an education for political gain because there was no other reason to do this
5109746 her actions in the community college board meeting today reflect her views as a member of the board that the state board should not be admitting and training workers who arent lawfully able to work in the state
5109747 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones

5109749 i move my chair a little bit and my call gets dropped its just weird
5109750 people like me who mainly listen to so called classical music are often both implicitly and explicitly accused of snobbery
5109751 this modern belief that classical music is somehow inherently snobbish and that its only of interest to an exclusive middle or upper class clique has i think had the effect in education of actually reducing opportunities for lower middle class or lower class students in music because it is assumed that classical music is of interest only to an elite because it is assumed that no one would want to study it from other backgrounds because of a false kind of inclusiveness which reduces classical music to the status of an expensive luxury which must always be leavened with pop and other kinds of music because of all this classical music in education has through no fault of its own been partly shut off from state education
5109752 you know i hate gay people so i let it be known i dont like gay people and i dont like to be around gay people i am homophobic i dont like it it shouldnt be in the world or in the united states
5109753 first of all i wouldnt want him on my team

5109755 it is inappropriate for him to be representing us given the disparity between his views and ours
5109756 finally someone who is honest it is ridiculous absurd petty bigoted and shows a lack of empathy that is gargantuan and unfathomable but it is honest and it illustrates the problem better than any of the fuzzy language other people have used so far

5109758 the percentage of e mails ive received overnight that are going to have to go into a little box somewhere just in case i end up dead are unbelievable hes been a lightening rod for people to finally open the floodgates and decide that they can say some pretty awful stuff
5109759 i will say this about the tim hardaway comments and the comments of people like him these are the loud comments that pollute the air
5109760 these are the comments that create the atmosphere that allow some of the tragic incidents of homophobia that weve seen this is what makes the lives of gay and lesbian young people in schools miserable its what stops gay and lesbian people in the workplace from coming out as well as the fact they can be fined in 33 states for being gay these are part of the problem
5109761 yes i regret it im sorry i shouldnt have said i hate gay people or anything like that
5109762 you know i hate gay people so i let it be known i dont like gay people and i dont like to be around gay people i am homophobic i dont like it it shouldnt be in the world or in the united states

5109772 we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately 4 8 million no outstanding long term debt and 10 715 130 common shares outstanding the company estimates that it presently has sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements through march 31 2009 however the companys cash needs could change as a result of potential payments that the company may be required to make to allergan which could be material under the allergan agreement and other matters the company will need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of its securities debt financings licensing arrangements joint ventures or other transactions management also believes that it could reduce or delay certain variable of discretionary costs to help meet its working capital needs
5109773 we do not believe that the fda will require us to cease marketing or recall any products however if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to have the fda reconsider data and it does not modify its determination the fda may require us to do so until fda marketing clearance is obtained allergan has certain rights under its agreement with the company including the right to recoup certain costs relating to ceasing the distribution of our products in the u s which could be material we cannot determine our estimated liability if any due allergan under our agreement and thus the financial results for the quarter ended june 30 2008 do not include any reserve for this contingency
5109774 these changes are designed to streamline management and refocus the company in the cardiovascular space where we believe we will have the greatest growth potential while we continue our presence and seek opportunities in the wound care post surgical and pain areas which have been our historical areas of concentration the cardiovascular area will represent the key future focus and investment priority of the company
