1510010 gt unhcr is reaching out to iraqi schoolchildren in the syrian capital damascus by distributing school supplies before the start of the school year next month
1510011 the syrian government has been very accommodating towards refugee children but there are obstacles to their attendance and additional costs such as buying school materials are a major problem
1510012 without education a person is ignorant and even though the schooling of some of my children was interrupted it is essential that they continue their studies
1510013 at least this distribution is sparing us some of the expenses

1510021 our white horse is near the ridgeway on the edge of the marlborough downs an area of outstanding natural beauty
1510022 im privileged to have the horse on my land but i dont relish the job of cleaning it up for several years we used chalk to brighten it up but that never lasted for long then three years ago lafarge cement offered to donate lime to us for an annual clean up and it makes a world of difference after just a couple of hours work shes looking good as new
1510023 hydrated lime has unique properties which make it ideal for a job like this we know that wiltshire has around 25 white horses but sadly they are not all in a good state of repair using hydralime makes it a quick and simple job and the results speak for themselves

1510028 we found a normal developmental program that works in young animals but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older
1510029 it accounts for the bulk of the molecular differences between young and old worms
1510030 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
1510031 a free radical doesnt care if its in a human cell or a worm cell
1510032 the take home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells
1510033 this is a new and potentially powerful circuit that has just been discovered for doing that
1510034 its a new way to think about how to slow the aging process
1510035 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1510036 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1510037 my husband is a coal miner my dads a coal miner my brothers a coal miner

1510090 and when the arschlochs have enough power they are the ones who define what it means to be an arschloch
1510091 i was 22 years old and idi aman had just been ousted and i thought that everything in uganda would be ok
1510092 i was immediately appointed nurse tutor as the previous one had just left after an assassination attempt
1510093 she was from idi amins tribe and there was a lot of tribal violence going on
1510094 we went through two hijackings a lot of shootings our compound being attacked and the results of horrendous atrocities coming in to the hospital day after day
1510095 from that point everything changed for me i became much more serious in myself i had come from carefree girl with a hunky dory fun life to a place where it was all about life and death with wondering who was going to survive a night and who wasnt
1510096 it drew me into myself i ended up praying more looking at life from a different angle my early idealism actually became stronger
1510097 i went home to scotland first and found that i didnt fit in any more
1510098 at the time the ethiopian famine was at its height so i went out there amid all the horrors of a communist system that wouldnt admit there was a problem even when their people were dropping like flies in a meningitis epidemic
1510099 there was a lot of walking from clinic to clinic there were a lot of maternal deaths women bleeding to death in the ditches while trying to get to the clinics
1510100 i spent six months walking around meeting eight year olds sniffing glue all day and older drug addicts i ended up starting a programme where they could tell their own stories in a group situation and in so doing come to a realisation that often they actually had choices in their lives
1510101 it was survivor guilt over that man who was murdered in front of me all those years before in uganda and i saw then that so many missionaries suffered from similar post traumatic stress disorder we had deadened ourselves to cope to keep going while our vitality as development workers as missionaries was fading
1510102 i left the order so that i could remain healthy otherwise i knew id be going right back into the same thing again i knew by then that trauma disconnects us from our family and our culture and i realised that i couldnt go through that again at a very dark time during my renewal course i had made a sort of pact with the man whom i had seen being murdered that i would survive in his memory if you like
1510103 it made me realise that not everything about my life in africa was dark i found humorous stories as i wrote maybe it is the kind of dark humour that you only find in those kind of situations

1510112 its difficult to explain we didnt play at all it was a particularly poor performance and it was very disappointing not to have reached any level of performance at all in a game of such importance
1510113 we have to win the title we play to win everything and we will try to do it we have been getting better and better we will try to be wiser we will show everyone we are still the gunners and that we can win the title
1510114 samir is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him
1510115 comes news that legal academia should take to heart in its own domain
1510116 its scares me to death because its a realization that the world is getting a little out of control and people need to calm down it scares me that we are capable of huge devastation to our world and its all we have im not sure people are acting consciously anymore it frightens me because my parents did not prepare me for this stuff i think our generation is very accustomed to disposable things and i dont think its really hitting people that the world is not a disposable item that we can go out and get another one at walmart when its broken i have a very very hard time even talking about it id rather be in denial
1510117 well it hits me like post partum depression if i start to really think about it i feel helpless and tired and overwhelmed and i just want to lay down and go to sleep i almost cant know to much about global warming at once i cant go there for my own sanitys sake its really devastating to me
1510118 my fear is that there are not enough people in this world thinking about climate change and what it will mean for our children and i dont want to go to that place where i think there is no hope
1510119 are there places or people that give you hope and inspiration
1510120 i like to find the little loop holes where real information lives and i am selective of what i read because i dont really trust mainstream media and newspapers to give me the news in a way that makes me feel empowered there is too much devastation in the news and for me to survive i have to find the loopholes in the media that keep my faith in humanity the stories of what is happening and the people who are making a difference
1510121 well as much as i feel people are going too far in their consumerism and in quelling their huge appetite for
1510122 yes because i think there are many people in my situation that feel overwhelmed and lonely kind of with their thoughts about it its certainly not something people want to greet each day talking about its hard right now to know who to talk to because its a sensitive and upsetting topic
1510123 what does climate change mean when you think about your children
1510124 oh monica i cant go there you are going to make me cry shes crying
1510125 its going to mean a life of survival for them
1510126 i think that as a parent part of my role right now is to bring them up in a way that i know they can take care of themselves they know how to grow their own food and tend a garden reintroduce the techniques we have lost like living off your land and being self sufficient
1510127 its too big to think about sometimes and thats the stuff i cant deal with
1510128 i have to live in the moment in order to stay sane
1510129 when i was a kid my mom used to tell me something that has really stuck with me
1510130 well one thing i do every day is i teach my kids every day lessons of conservation and sustainability within our home having them understand how to garden recycle etc i do not let them in on my fears about the climate change because i dont want to burden them this is their childhood and as adults we need to fix it because we are the ones who broke it
1510131 its about teaching them now activities that i think will really make a difference in their future i also try to make a difference by looking at what other household practices we can adopt to lesson our carbon footprint
1510132 we are looking into alternative energy right now and actively trying to get educated about wind powered energy each day is a new opportunity to learn something new about how we can live more consciously and create awareness in our children even simple things like conserving water when bathing tinfoil i wont throw it out now i wash it and reuse it my children do the same we used to throw it away
1510133 we dont use plastic bags at the grocery store we use reusable bags and we keep them in our car
1510134 is there a parting thought that you would care to leave based on the fact that you know a parent might read this
1510135 the only thing i want to say is that its our children that causes everyone to really want to work together to make a difference our love for them is so motivating
1510136 i thank god that we are parents and have been given the opportunity to have children in our lives and we have to continue to support one another and be strong we have to know that we are linked to every other parent around the world and share a common bond love for our children
1510137 from one parent to another i feel like we are all joining hands with every parent around the world taking a deep breath our collective consciousness around the world can be elevated if we do it together and can make a huge difference as long as people are willing to go there and stop ignoring it as an issue or waiting for someone else to make a difference
1510138 one of the recent things i read talked about christie brinkley a big star in her day and her own fears the poverty food challenges and water supply issues makes her very scared and how its going to affect her children its humbling to know that these same issues affect us a common bond and i can relate to her easily it was so interesting to realize that she shares some of my fears thats hope
1510139 hope is we are not alone in this and parents everywhere can make the difference
1510140 its basically an ongoing experiment to create a portal for me and my students to work online
1510141 we tried every social media application you can think of some worked some didnt
1510142 it was a poor performance and im still angry about it i wasnt going to go in and apologise about anything i said
1510143 im glad that the spl season will begin as planned on saturday nobody wants to see our game disrupted in any way
1510144 after tomorrow well have faced four premiership premier league sides and two from the championship as well as porto and feyenoord
1510145 you want to test yourself in pre season and they have all been hard matches but enjoyable too i always like playing against premiership teams you want to test yourself against that quality of opposition
1510146 kevin has got one of the toughest jobs in the country
1510147 we have lost two captains in a week and when the job spits out a man like michael vaughan then we have to look at ways in which we can take away some of the pressure from kevin pietersen
1510148 the demands on his time are massive that is why i will be sitting down with kevin to talk about what levels of support we can put in place when you look at the level of support that top executives get it makes you realise that we have to look at borrowing some of those practices
1510149 i found it funny the other night when i was told that paul collingwood spent sunday night washing his england kit can you imagine a top premier league footballer going home and hanging out his washing it is only a little thing but it shows we should be delivering a different level of support the place for us to start this process is with the captain but then we need to speak to the whole team
1510150 ubs categorically rejects any claim that the firm engaged in a widespread campaign to move inventory from the firms own books and into private client accounts

1510176 the united states loses four percent of the gross national product due to alloy corrosion
1510177 a network of continuous metal nanoparticles allows the carbon to dissolve and diffuse through the protective oxide scales without the need of a crack or a pore
1510178 by examining the oxide scale we find the metal nanoparticles
1510179 if they are eliminated we can create a more corrosion resistant and longer lasting alloy
1510180 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1510181 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1510182 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1510183 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1510184 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1510185 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1510186 to meet the performance and efficiency demands of cutting edge applications such as controlling robotic systems testing wireless devices and designing hybrid vehicles users must have the ability to quickly incorporate the latest technologies such as multicore processors fpgas and wireless communication
1510187 labview offers the shortest path to apply these technologies using parallel programming while providing users the flexibility to define their solutions with application specific optimizations
1510188 fast and accurate electro optical test with a turn key solution are key contributors for developing high quality products with a reduced design cycle

1510477 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1510478 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1510479 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1510480 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1510481 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1510482 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1510483 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case

1510491 it just shows you what a class organization that were dealing with that mr marshall and his attorney find out about this as the result of a press release
1510492 they didnt even have the courtesy to contact mr marshall directly or his lawyer the league appears to be more concerned about its image than treating its players with dignity and respect the best part of this is we get to appeal this suspension to the very commissioner who chose to suspend him in this fashion

1510501 everything we do is about trying to achieve a medal at the olympics
1510502 although last year was the first year i ran the 10 000m i was frustrated to just miss out on a medal at the world championships
1510503 but that experience gave me the motivation to keep training hard and go that one step better in beijing
1510504 i am really excited about it and i think the experience of osaka will stand me in good stead the 10 000m is what i have focused all my training on
1510505 the race at the world championships came down to who could handle the heat best it was over 37 degrees and there was really high humidity it became more of a slog who could last out that was an unusual situation for a championship but i think beijing will be the same

1510516 my whole body ached when i finally managed to make my way to see a doctor in sungai petani he couldnt find anything wrong and merely told me to lose weight
1510517 while that bit of news helped it didnt solve the problem then i chanced upon a magazine that had a story on sonotron after the second therapy from a clinic in petaling jaya the pain lessened considerably for the past two years ive had to sleep on a reclining chair as its been almost impossible to get up from a horizontal position from the bed when i recently went to terengganu i could sleep on the hotel bed and get up on my own
1510518 it has worked for salamiah and ive even tried it for my tennis elbow and an old knee injury
1510519 the real test came when i had to drive for eight hours to and from terengganu before i couldnt sit for long as my knee would hurt this time surprisingly i handled the distance without any complaints
1510520 it has to do with your frame of mind and some might find it hard to accept this form of therapy
1510521 whats good is that there are no drugs involved and thats comforting especially since my wife has been on too much medication already
1510522 for one of my elderly female patients i cut off all the medications and put her on sonotron therapy now she can walk and has left the old folks home to stay with her family in her hometown

1510527 who ever let the facts or supporters positions get in the way of a political attack aboard the low road express thats no problem at all
1510528 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1510529 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1510553 there is a big risk today when using mobile devices you have sensitive information including credit card details user names and passwords all stored on them and these can be easily obtained by a variety of malicious methods such as phishing and trojan worms
1510554 looking at mobile solutions we can begin with wireless notebooks and move down to mobiles there are inherent risks when it comes to having wireless networks and so its crucial to have security and encryption tied into your network in case of hacking or even when the device is lost or stolen
1510555 you have to look out for rogue devices such as access points and even the bridging of wireless laptops which opens back doors and exposes the wired network
1510556 when it comes to mobile phones the point to be made is that in terms of the sheer absolute number of threats there are not as many in comparison to laptops and desktops that being said there are still a few hundred threats being released throughout the year and they are all fairly sophisticated
1510557 some of the statistics out there say that there are 15 times more smart phones lost than notebooks that is based purely on the size as a phone is more likely to be left in a taxi or at a coffee shop they are much more mobile and much more personal and that combination can lead to the possibility of more data leakage on the back of that

1510591 we are encouraged by our position and remain positive about the future of craft beer even as the craft category has raised pricing in the face of significant cost pressures
1510592 so the new religion of global warming however convenient it may be to politicians is not as harmless as it may appear at first sight indeed the more one examines it the more it resembles a da vinci code of environmentalism it is a great story and a phenomenal best seller it contains a grain of truth and a mountain of nonsense and that nonsense could be very damaging indeed we appear to have entered a new age of unreason which threatens to be as economically harmful as it is profoundly disquieting it is from this above all that we really do need to save the planet
1510593 the fact that advocacy may persuade the electorate is hardly a reason to suppress it

1510599 im more interested in the purer form of fascism and while i dont subscribe to the whole worship hitler thing his comments on multiculturalism and politics in general are still just as relevant today as they were 70 odd years ago
1510600 i cant say im into the whole national socialist thing as far as im concerned national socialism died with its sic creator not that i do not have any regard for his writings indeed they still have much relevance today he laid a foundation that we should build on

1510603 there is always a danger for new parties to rise
1510604 it happened before because people werent being heard in the bush but people in the country are pragmatic they will see a stronger party in a better position to win and we will have to deliver for them

1510607 my campaign will be centered around environmental and development issues principally in relation to the unit boom around the shire
1510608 given the tensions certain development proposals have caused in areas such as bass hill and camden i would vigorously oppose any similar developments that would threaten the peace and harmony of the shire
1510609 we most certainly do not want a repeat of the scenes we saw in cronulla a few years ago
1510610 islam is a problem but people can change their religion but if youre an asian you are an asian

1510612 nick griffin rescued the bnp from the murky depths of of right wing extremism
1510613 hes got quite a lot of publicity and some of it strikes a chord with the locals here
1510614 that will really depend on how far the present economic downturn goes and whether they have the leadership and organisational ability to expand beyond a small core of activists
1510615 right wing extremist movements have tended to be energised in periods of economic difficulty and during the life of labor governments both federal and state
1510616 its in periods of economic stress that significant numbers of voters have tended to become fearful of external pressures on their living conditions

1510663 i have got an extremely witty sense of humour thankyouverymuch but unfortunately because of a complete satuaration of the same negative messages about women and only positive self affirming messages aimed men my humour has been sapped away
1510664 we really need to get the house on the market
1510665 lesters an excellent football coach so we had versatility with him
1510666 when we came to fill carls spot my preference my objective was leaning toward an offensive coach but i just had to go out and find the best guy not the best running backs coach that made the thing a little bit easier
1510667 it ended up being one of those lucky breaks for us that he was available
1510668 this is my first job coaching running backs but ive coached just about every other position on offense
1510669 its exciting its a new opportunity youre learning new things im replacing carl jackson on this staff but ill never replace him its obviously hard replacing a legend a great coach like that but i think its new and exciting
1510670 when i had the linebackers i was so involved with the linebackers that maybe i didnt get to know everybody else as much as youd like to know them as kids
1510671 one of my goals with norm as it is with any coach is to keep them working effectively for as long as we possibly can
1510672 one thing i wanted to do was try to cut back on some of norms duties like summer camps we really dont need norms energy there part of my thinking is to create an nfl coordinator position for him i think it gives us a couple benefits itll give him a little more preparation time during the day because he wont be sitting in on individual group meetings with players i think thatll be a benefit the other benefit is i think it gives him a little bit more freedom to visit individually with players from all positions free him up more time to do that i think we get a benefit there to fill that void
1510673 i wanted to free some of erics time up to be our personnel director give him more time to study prospects tapes and all that
1510674 the way we recruit we probably have to look a little harder and look a little deeper and maybe watch more tape than some other places
1510675 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment
1510676 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve
1510677 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1510678 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses
1510679 although we clearly face more challenging macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth

1510698 these are probably the most challenging times we have faced as a company the unnatural rise in crude and natural rubber prices have had a cascading impact across all raw materials combined with prices which are two or three times higher than they were last year we are facing the added problem of certain essential crude based raw materials being unavailable even at higher prices merely by increasing product prices we will not be able to bridge this yawning gap the only solution is to look internally undertaking rigorous efficiency and economy drives across the organisation thats the silver lining i believe this frugality will only strengthen the company in the long run
1510699 you see my husband is in that store right now paying for gas for this pump and if he pays for this pump and i then move i lose money i cant move

1510702 i bought a western digital mybook pro edition ii 1tb to replace it with my western digital my book 300gb and also to be able to mirror the drives for having a backup on the second 500gb drive my first mistake using the wd software to copy the files from the 300gb to the 1tb mybook it erased all data on my 300gb after days and weeks of recovering my data from the 300gb i manually copied everything to the 1tb mybook assuming it was an user error since then the problems continued the 1tb overheats and it also shuts itself down randomly every so many minutes and comes back on again at will so that i cant work with my data anymore sometimes it also doesnt show my data on the drive at all any more only folders are visible but no content in the folders i paid over 350 dollars for this drive that erased all my data first and afterwards fails to show me my data at all and only displays it at random will crashing every so many minutes i cant work productively with this drive any more since the problems have become worse in the past year since i purchased this drive i am now worried that at some point i will lose my data completely i also found out by doing a research on the internet that i am not the only one with those problems so i would like to ask what solution you could offer to solve my problems
1510703 the medical board has snubbed its nose at those recommendations and the committee
1510704 there is nothing more annoying than having to endure cigarette smoke wafting under your nose when youre trying to enjoy a meal
1510705 i think given that smokers are in the greater minority group these days that really people should be able to enjoy the social pleasure of an alfresco area
1510706 its a very strong smoke signal to the wa government to bring in some blanket bans across the whole of wa
1510707 if for no other reason than many people arent aware of where local government boundaries are and state legislation would be much easier to police than legislation thats brought in by local councils
1510708 many tourists coming from overseas are coming from jurisdictions where there dont even exist bans on indoor smoking let alone some sort of illogical nonsensical outdoor smoking ban
1510709 because it will mean theyll be able to make direct comparisons much more easily on prices
1510710 and im certain that the website going to be established with snapshots of prices from products will be used at least by a considerable number of shoppers to give them a sort of an idea about the competitive opportunities
1510711 these are the sort of things national governments can do theyre difficult for state governments the i would hope that perhaps even in tasmania we can see new entratnts because that in the end sharper competition is what matters
1510712 woolworths says if you give us 12 to 18 months to do it it really shouldnt drive up our costs mr bowen told the nine network on wednesday
1510713 now the smaller retailers of course there would be a tight increased cost as a percentage so i need to work with industry and consumer groups over the next few weeks to try and get that balance right
1510714 the last thing we want to do is put more compliance costs on smaller businesses
1510715 the key is working out what is significant and where you draw the line
1510716 we do need to ensure that everybody has a level playing field and were not giving one supermarket an advantage over another but we do need to ensure that smaller supermarkets arent disadvantaged
1510717 if they cant provide that guarantee then this is another political stunt by prime minister mr kevin rudd
1510718 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine

1510721 increasing the overall number of higher degree scholarships and specifically increasing the number of targeted higher degree scholarships will help sustain and develop tertiary qualified professionals to meet australias needs
1510722 the job prospects for higher degree graduates choosing to focus on a research career are among the most insecure in the country living from three or five year contract to three or five year contract and having to effectively apply for their jobs again one or two years before the contract ends and so on
1510723 some of our best and brightest have among the worst job prospects making a research career unattractive in relation to other options
1510724 it is time to rethink this whole system and assist universities to give job security to those pursuing a research career
1510725 this is just another example of the yawning gulf between morris iemmas rhetoric and the reality
1510726 this is just another example of a government thats so mired in leadership tensions that theyve taken their eye off the main game
1510727 domestic violence is a problem across nsw its incredibly disappointing it lets down the victims of domestic violence the fact that morris iemma hasnt followed through

1510729 i am the security officer whom len kiely sexually harrassed
1510730 what len kiely did was totally inappropriate and hes made a full and public apology and not only a public apology but an apology to the lady affected
1510731 everybody deserves a second chance and im confident that len will continue to be a good local member for the people of sanderson
1510732 as a chief minister i could not stand on a platform of leadership and give support in any way to a man who has done this
1510733 republicans have been escalating their attacks on democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama ill and the democrats over oil drilling and we need to push back hard
1510734 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1510735 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis
1510736 t he solution to lowering oil prices and lessening the already heavy burden on the average american at the gas pump is to explore all available resources for gaining energy independence from foreign sources which means domestic off shore drilling americans want to end our dependency on foreign oil and the only way to do that is to drill off of our coasts and in anwr

1510746 they are just as high this year but i think maybe the approach and process has changed a little bit just because we went through what we went through last year
1510747 there is a certain amount of urgency when youre coming off of a season when you were 7 9
1510748 i think players are anxious to start 08 and start it off on a better note than we did last year
1510749 the fact is that guys went home after minicamp and they did everything they needed to do every guy to get ready to have a great year a special season and one that well always remember
1510750 i think that just goes to show you the commitment level and where everybodys head is at

1510756 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1510757 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1510758 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1510759 it seems to me its pretty much a slam dunk
1510760 owed a duty of care the highest degree of care
1510761 one of the real areas of satisfaction if you can call it that is that weve maintained all along this was an inside job
1510762 i hope somebody who has some authority will call us and make it right with this family

1510778 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1510779 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1510780 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1510781 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1510782 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed

1510794 for those players to be out from a football perspective six days before a game when they have had an eight day break is just unacceptable and then to top it off by being dishonest to the people in an environment where you rely on honesty and you rely on trust is unforgivable
1510795 there needs to be a strong stance made by the club to set the tone not just for alan didak or heath shaw but for all young players at football clubs
1510796 i think heath deserves everything he cops but the one thing about it the lying part theres an unwritten law within footy clubs that you look after your mates and unless they do something that physically harms someone or is against the law maybe heath did the right thing in one way in helping out a mate but he probably picked the wrong person to do it for
1510797 obviously there is not much we can say apart from the fact that what heath has done is inexcusable and there is no defence
1510798 no we have got a lot to play for we dont want to lose at all we love winning
1510799 we are pretty competitive people and there is plenty to play for positions wins everything it is a pretty obvious answer but we want to win every week
1510800 it is a pressure cooker atmosphere but instead of journeying into the unknown we know what is ahead of us and what is expected
1510801 there are still nerves but nerves are a great thing they make you excited
1510802 i find it a bit amusing actually i cant see why
1510803 people should start saving their money or put it on someone else
1510804 there are about six or seven other blokes who are well ahead
1510805 i have had to play a number of different roles than i did last year different positions which i have absolutely enjoyed and have developed me as a footballer
1510806 half forward i went to half back a little bit out on the wing but that is a strength of ours we have got a number of blokes who can play through the midfield
1510807 there is no doubt we would be keen to discuss him
1510808 we would certainly discuss anyone who became available like that
1510809 weve always tried to keep an eye on the ex south australians especially ones that have talent like he has
1510810 obviously wed want to talk to him and get a view on his off field issues
1510811 were sold on his ability to play the game but wed obviously want to get a decent view of the off field issues going on
1510812 probably every year weve tried to go down that path to some degree
1510813 like everyone else were very keen to get involved in this draft so wed be reluctant to give up early draft picks
1510814 we met yesterday and spoke about graham he is going to be available for selection
1510815 he has done a lot of things right in the past couple of weeks graham is aware of the standards that are required in preparing to play for us
1510816 he had some guidelines on what we wanted to see and he has delivered that in the past couple of weeks
1510817 he has done some enormous work and he has committed to a long term plan with his off field issues his attitude towards his training and fitness and the attitude he has shown going back to port adelaide in the sanfl has been sensational unbelievable
1510818 his preparation has improved weve seen that and we know he can do it its just a matter of doing it for a longer basis now
1510819 were confident graham can come back into the team and perform his role to the level we expect
1510820 graham is available for selection i didnt say he is coming back into the side and i dont think it is simply sitting down and saying it is a simple swap of johncock for porplyzia
1510821 hes a tough nut he will soldier on and he is very keen to play later in the year
1510822 hopefully we can do the right thing by him and hell be there
1510823 i was surprised as a football fan that collingwood just a few games from the finals series and right on the edge of the eight a team that can make the top four a team that can win a grand final that they were all out having more than just an occasional drink
1510824 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will looking at the collingwood football club and asking questions
1510825 unfortunately we are dealing with two players who have made really poor decisions that have affected their behaviour which i think they will regret for the rest of their life we forget about the players who are disciplined and focused and do the right things by the code of conduct
1510826 i dont accept that there is a drinking culture at the collingwood football club
1510827 he is a pretty good player i think there would be 15 other clubs who would like a player of the quality of alan didak
1510828 we had in place special behavioural criteria as part of an existing contract and for a period of time he was bound by those
1510829 at the end of that period of time when we signed a new deal he was bound by the codes of every other player in the afl and he has breached those codes
1510830 one of the regrets is taking those boundaries away and maybe that sent the wrong message
1510831 they were calculated parameters and during that time his life was at a peak and in a lot of ways we started to turn him around
1510832 these two rainbows are from this last weekends fishing trip to lava lake
1510833 two weeks before as i was kicking my float tube back to the launch area i was casting a blood leech over some weed beds and stripping line in with my type 5 sinking line
1510834 this last weekend steve hughes and i went back to lava looking for some big fish

1510844 quando cheguei ao detran para regularizar tudo na segunda feira confirmaram que eu estava certo e que n o teria que pagar a taxa disseram tamb m que a apreens o tinha sido irregular
1510845 mesmo assim exigiram o pagamento das di rias e do reboque
1510846 falaram que como a apreens o foi feita pela pol cia militar e o detran pol cia civil n o teriam como me liberar dos pagamentos para a retirada da moto disseram que n o poderiam fazer nada e que era para eu pagar tudo e depois correr atr s

1510869 the majority of these incidents are occurring in the council car park behind the reject shop in mortimer street and during daylight hours
1510870 it is also important for owners to reduce the chance of their vehicles being broken into
1510871 thieves usually steal items such as mobile phones cash cds and cd players
1510872 people should take these items with them when possible or at least store them out of sight in the vehicle
1510873 as thieves usually gain entry by smashing a window its also a good idea to park in well lit busy streets whenever possible
1510874 it may sound obvious but always remember to lock your car and ensure all the windows are fully closed

1510876 when i was head coach of the usa volleyball team from 1985 88 we trained full time year around and we played 70 to 90 matches a year all over the world if you wanted to play on the u s team you could not play professionally now all the players play pro and join the national team only for the summer and part of the fall so this 2008 team has played about 20 matches prior to coming to china we have an experienced team but still somewhat of an all star team in that they are not together that long

1510880 of course the future careers of the three players was discussed it was canvassed
1510881 im not going to sit here and talk rubbish to you of course it was discussed
1510882 at the end of our playing campaign the three boys careers will be assessed again
1510883 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the season but were not sitting down as a club right at the moment going who are we going to trade we dont do that until the end of the year
1510884 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own team mates in the eye and actually lying to them that really destroys the essence of the club
1510885 it was decided by the leadership group and the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper
1510886 we feel that the integrity of this football club and that the policies of honesty and integrity that we build the whole organisation on if thats robbed or taken away or diminished in any way shape or form then youre striking at the very essence or core of your existence you might as well turn the lights off and go home
1510887 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club and asking questions

1510907 ela convidou minha sobrinha de 13 anos para ir numa festa na casa do prefeito
1510908 quando eles ficaram sozinhos e ele tirou a roupa ela teve medo e fugiu j o meu primo tem uma filha de 14 anos e acha bom que o prefeito queira ela s vezes ele est jogando domin aqui em casa o celular toca e ele diz t prefeito j vou levar ela ai e manda a menina ir se arrumar assim ele conseguiu dinheiro para reformar a casa dele

1510916 id offer the hypothesis that any sufficiently advanced read write technology will get used for two purposes pornography and activism
1510917 with web 2 0 weve embarced the idea that people are going to share pictures of their cats and now we build sophisticated tools to make that easier to do as a result were creating a wealth of tech thats extremely helpful for activists there are twin revolutions going on the ease of creating content and the ease of sharing it with local and global audiences
1510918 of course the activists win sometimes too when google maps became accessible in bahrain it let bahrani activists answer a pressing question in that small crowded nation who owns all the land from the air it becomes pretty clear that large chunks of the nation are reserved for palaces owned by the royal family

1510963 if we dont arrest this problem we will face difficulties
1510964 it has the potential to be very very very serious for us
1510965 how these conclusions apply to the second generation haitians would be lines for future inquiry in the bahamian context
1510966 most of the opinions reported on were negative and focused on problems created by haitian nationals for the bahamas rare were any feature articles exploring the issues with any significant degree of depth and reflection rare also were any reports on individual haitian nationals situations such as might give them a human face
1510967 there is no elaboration on the migration phenomena or the meaning of the haitian diaspora these important issues need to be understood when living in a global multicultural multilingual world and the media does not attempt to help the average bahamian to understand the problem
1510968 raids on the haitian community represent only one side of the enforcement necessary to stop the migration motor
1510969 both supply and demand must be constrained if word is to get back to haiti that it is no longer possible for illegal migrants to regularize their stay after they arrive
1510970 this response may be interpreted as indicating that despite the difficulties which respondents face while living in the bahamas they felt better off compared to their situation in haiti prior to migrating
1510971 clearly as far as policy makers are concerned it is the long stay members of the haitian community who are of most interest as it is these who will utilise the services of the country thus a distinction should be made between the total size of the haitian community and the size of the resident haitian community

1511109 neither republicans pretending everythings dandy nor democrats clinging to race based policies are addressing the real problems of today
1511110 aa even exacerbates racist tendencies among whites so i conclude the aa neither equalizes opportunity since it excludes plenty of people who lack opportunity nor does it fight racism since it institutionalizes racial preferences aa is a bad program
1511111 shes a lot more pleasant to work with than keith ill tell you that much
1511112 shes funny smart hard working entertaining and has no ego
1511113 maybe if something has come of hillary clintons run its that a woman in a male dominated industry can be taken a little bit more fucking seriously
1511114 youre not being fairminded here i am not going to speculate on the reasons for that but the facts tell a pretty clear story that you are just flatly wrong in your analysis
1511115 and anyone who thinks david gregory is a newsman should be forced to watch his performance with
1511116 i think the most interesting comparison is between the civil war and world war i in gdp terms
1511117 the total number of casualties is so low compared to other wars that the number of wounded iraq war veterans is still vastly smaller than the corresponding number from previous conflicts
1511118 my question is do we really have 5x the economy we did in those glory days at least according to certain conservatives of the post war era
1511119 the federal government since 1940 and particularly since 1990 can be characterized as a military machine with other programs attached as window dressing
1511120 military spending is only a small fraction of total federal spending
1511121 so we killed a million people for oil companies and war profiteering so what
1511122 this is great but if only if were more conservative
1511123 slate esquire good city journal the atlantic or the new yorker
1511124 editorial slant that is big tent right of center as open minded about what we publish as the new republic the new yorker or the new york times magazine but on the center right rather than the center left
1511125 slate and the atlantic are center right publications as a moderate liberal who is a regular reader of both that hasnt been my impression this is a statement requires further explanation
1511126 but in a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
1511127 but the leading man is tall slim and handsome and most people in america are shorter fatter and uglier so obviously this movie will be a flop
1511128 isnt it a problem that many people are willing to wait hours to hear him speak and that his oratory is so polished and that he inspires people
1511129 but in a nation where 85 of the voting age population has normal cheeks could mccains chipmunk cheeks be a liability his chipmunk cheeks just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
1511130 barack obama might just be too popular too charismatic too smart and too good looking to be president is that what we want
1511131 there is precious little evidence the american people actually want joe everyman to be their president we have repeatedly elected really rich people prominent military figures and even an bonafide former movie star
1511132 they said it could never happen they said that fat people and thin people could never get along
1511133 another liability for obama is the good judgment he displayed in opposing the iraq war which most americans who showed bad judgment in supporting it may not be able to identify with
1511134 obamas also taller than average which is well known to be a disadvantage in presidential politics
1511135 those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground
1511136 if democrats win then we wont be able to unionbust anymore
1511137 thats why my new handbag line is called confidence its important just to feel in that way and to know and believe in yourself and everything is possible
1511138 shucks petey cant even be gracious on an occasion like this
1511139 speaking of liberals who are experts at losing elections think i saw a profile of one in the enquirer this week
1511140 whats it like to work with megan nudge nudge wink wink
1511141 people who lie and smear to divide the democratic party
1511142 its hard for people to make a living and we wouldnt want to take that away

1511200 can someone please explain to me why we shouldnt be helping the indians put down pakistan permanently
1511201 but we should certainly stop acting as if a pseudo military dictatorship with a terroristic intelligence aparatus is morally equivalent to the worlds largest democracy
1511202 a democracy that has managed to survive remain liberal and thrive despite facing challenges of poverty and ethnic religious cultural antipathy far beyond what we have to deal with

1511290 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1511291 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1511296 in a two hour session professionals have the opportunity to choose objects that represent the meaning of their own work to them and use these objects to share this meaning with each other marie a young nursing administrator from a large urban hospital took part in one of these sessions as each person seated around the table placed the objects they had gathered i noticed that she had kept something back and put it beneath her chair as the instruction is to use all the symbols you bring to the table i had wondered about this one by one the group members spoke of the objects they had chosen and how each symbolized a part of what their work meant to them we watched as marie placed a slender white candle in a tall candlestick in the center of the table it was unlit just showing it to us obviously had a deep emotional significance for her i offered her a box of kitchen matches and she sat holding it for a long time unable to light the candle or even talk about it finally she lit it saying in a barely audible voice that it represented her real self it was a touching and surprisingly intimate moment especially powerful as the candle bore a striking resemblance to her own beauty simplicity and purity one at a time others also shared their work and then the woman seated next to marie at the table began to speak she too had an unlit candle it was short and fat she told us that it represented her dream of being a professional and working with an open heart as she spoke instead of lighting her candle with the matches she picked it up reached across the low wooden boundary between her section of the table and maries and lit it from the flame of maries candle marie burst into tears the woman a sophisicated psychiatrist began to apologize saying that she had no idea why she had not used the matches and had not meant to invade maries space oh no marie told her its that there is so much cynicism and judgment among us that i never show anyone at work what really matters to me only my patients know i am afraid that people will laugh or that they will think less of me and so i hide myself for me this work is holy it is my calling when you lit your candle from mine i saw why it might be important to stop hiding perhaps i can find the courage to be who i really am perhaps there are others like you who are hiding too there was a moment of silence and then these two women reached for each others hands

1511323 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1511324 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1511325 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today

1511332 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1511333 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1511334 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1511335 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1511336 thats not giving him mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1511337 t here is an outside chance the companies could call upon treasury for more than 100 billion
1511338 i mean they do all the things that lets face it liberal journalists like like put home mortgages out there for poor people and so right now beating up on fannie mae is kind of politically incorrect
1511339 fan and fred also couldnt prosper for as long as they have without the support of the political left this includes mr rep barney frank and sen chuck schumer d n y on capitol hill as well as mr paul krugman and the washington posts steven pearlstein in the press
1511340 here you go blog away on the designated day that weve already worked out
1511341 just one of the many advantages to owning rather than renting your own elvis suit

1511348 without doubt man united will be far more flashy than chelsea however they may just lack substance this time around
1511349 mourinho has indicated that he intends to return to a 4 3 3 formation this season which could be ominous for chelseas title rivals
1511350 the loss of henry is obviously significant but will not lead to the meltdown some have predicted
1511351 how benitez intends to mould liverpools increasingly classy squad into a coherent eleven man team remains to be seen
1511352 david moyes has built a neat little side over the last couple of seasons which should give a good account of itself in 2007 2008
1511353 villa made steady progress throughout last season and will continue to improve this time around
1511354 santa cruz is the major new addition to the side and should offer something different up front however hughes will be looking towards key men like nelsen and mccarthy if rovers are to perform well again this year
1511355 harry redknapp has spent a lot of money strengthening his squad however it remains to be seen if his side can challenge for europe
1511356 eriksson sides are never particularly exciting however they are generally very effective and with a huge amount of money to spend man city could soon be troubling their illustrious neighbours just a little bit more
1511357 i really like the look of the side curbishley is putting together at west ham certainly in terms of a first eleven
1511358 much has been made of tottenhams formidable strike force however the fact of the matter is that realistically only two of berbatov keane bent and defoe can be on the pitch at any one time
1511359 big sam has always valued endeavour and organisation over flowing attack minded football and he may have a quite a challenge persuading the toon army to come round to his way of thinking
1511360 probably another season of consolidation for boro unless yakubu leaves in which case it could be a struggle
1511361 wigan athletic have been busy assembling what can only be described as a relegation dream team
1511362 having keane at the helm should more than compensate for any deficit in playing talent
1511363 now sammy lee has taken over the reigns the fear must be that wanderers squad will be exposed for what it really is
1511364 lawrie sanchez has practically rebuilt the entire fulham first eleven over the summer and at 25m the improvements have not come cheap
1511365 with the exception of sidwell most of last seasons side remains in tact however the feeling must be that the surprise factor is now gone
1511366 an immediate return to the championship is on the cards
1511367 derby county ground their way into the premier league with a series of 1 0 victories last season but will have to be significantly more adventurous if they are to avoid an immediate return to the championship
1511368 our love is like the wind i cant see it but i can feel it
1511369 suena como la canci n americana al estilo de bob dylan
1511370 se acercan m s a la canci n francesa y a la d cada de los sesenta
1511371 tenemos como tres a os trabajando en el nuevo cd empec a componer incluso durante el tiempo que hice el pasado disco la idea era hacer algunos temas en ingl s pero que fueran un poco m s cr ticos hacer algo como lo que yo he hecho en espa ol y fue un reto bastante dif cil pero creo que logramos cosas divertidas
1511372 yo creo que son letras m s metaf ricas de lo que hab a hecho antes antes eran con enojo ahora hay en ellas ese fuego pero son con met foras y juegos en la interpretaci n
1511373 quer amos hacer colaboraciones desde hace tiempo pero nunca hab amos tenido el tiempo para hacerlo pero gracias a mi esposo paul se arreglaron muchas cosas mercedes grab en argentina bunbury en espa a la mari vino a m xico y pudimos grabar juntas y a rub n lo conozco desde hace 10 a os y ya quer amos hacer algo juntos
1511374 mercedes canta un tema que yo compuse se llama tierra de luz y habla un poco de la nostalgia del emigrante que se ha ido lejos que extra a y se siente chiquito lejos de su pa s
1511375 con rub n cantamos un tema que se llama perro negro sobre el nahual que es la idea de que un hombre se puede convertir en un animal y puede llegar en la noche a hacer una maldad
1511376 fue bastante dif cil para los oaxaque os y mexicanos y no sab amos c mo lidiar con un problema as todos quer amos vivir una vida en paz pero al mismo tiempo hay muchas rutinas en nuestros pa ses donde hay un sistema de corrupci n que ya est bastante bien asentado y que no lo mueves para nada hay un tema que se llama justicia que habla de esto y es en el que canta bunbury conmigo
1511377 hab a mucha gente mixteca en la audiencia en california que lavan trastes que cultivan los campos y recibimos una ovaci n de pie fue el momento m s intenso de mi vida pens ok ya hice mi trabajo me puedo morir ahora fue un honor el tener esa conexi n

1511379 todo el mundo acostumbra a ver a los atletas en competici n ganando o celebrando nosotros quer amos mostrarlos al descubierto tal y como son sus m sculos y su poder
1511380 pero tambi n con el que m s he disfrutado
1511381 were sitting on the fence waiting out the storm we are very patient developers and we want this project to sell out quickly right now the project is literally collecting dust i havent thought about it at all for the last four months
1511382 dont spend your time defending yourself s teve if you do you will do nothing else defend the word of god and his gospel and let the lord take care of others and their opinions of you be teachable and thank the lord for even their unkind and untrue words your reputation is not what is ultimately important gods glory is
1511383 so if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your gift there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court lest your accuser hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you be put in prison
1511384 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have gained your brother but if he does not listen take one or two others along with you that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a gentile and a tax collector truly i say to you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say to you if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my father in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name there am i among them
1511385 i therefore a prisoner for the lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
1511386 it is the glory of a man to overlook an offense
1511387 i told my wife she should enter the beauty pageant
1511388 the steady increase in pet ownership confirms that a growing number of us are realizing pets truly enhance our lives
1511389 pets not only provide unconditional love and affection research now shows they also provide significant health benefits
1511390 people are no longer satisfied to reward their pet in pet terms
1511391 this day is dedicated to the liturgical memorial of our lady help of christians who is venerated with great devotion at the marian shrine of sheshan in shanghai
1511392 in the statue overlooking the shrine you lift your son on high offering him to the world with open arms and a gesture of love
1511393 help catholics always be credible witnesses to this love ever clinging to the rock of peter on which the church is built
1511394 if you belonged to the official church of the shanghai diocese you could go
1511395 but if you belonged to the underground church of the diocese of shanghai you were not allowed to go you were also not allowed to go if you were coming from somewhere other than the diocese of shanghai
1511396 we hope that by our press release we will put some pressure on the authorities and before they decide what to do with them they will think twice about it
1511397 harrassment of unregistered catholic bishops priests and laypersons continued including government surveillance and detentions
1511398 every one of them is either in prison disappeared under house arrest or under surveillance
1511399 the media people should talk more about the religious persecution in china
1511400 they should let the world know what is going on in china regarding the persecution of religious believers not only for the roman catholic church but for all the churches the media is not doing its job its duty
1511401 excuse me little lady what would you like to drink with your pizza
1511402 one such competitive edge not commonly considered as part of a homes marketing strategy is to sell a property either fully or partially furnished
1511403 this strategy has been particularly effective in selling million dollar real estate in the las vegas market where many interiors have been professionally designed but the method could certainly be extrapolated for homes in other pricing categories and regions
1511404 while bundling furnishings with a home sell is a viable strategy sellers should not force a homes contents onto prospective buyers which can work against them
1511405 instead give buyers the option to procure the property with or without furnishings and have a pre established sale price set for either scenario also be prepared to put together a bill of sale for the furniture separate from the homes sale price
1511406 in a marketplace where lenders have tightened their proverbial belts forcing many home buyers to come to the closing table with more cash a partially furnished or fully turn key home can be a very attractive proposition and the all important deciding factor in choosing one property over another
1511407 what is the meaning of my life now what if the universe we live in right now is a part of a bigger universe
1511408 this time i dont quite agree with your views charles
1511409 thanks charles good discussion i obviously agree with that clarification what im disputing are the 2 original assumptions you base your point on
1511410 i didnt want to drift too far away from the old school sensibility
1511411 that was my main objective i wanted to do an album where everybody went into the room at the same time and played thats important because the personalities of the musicians come through and its not just a progression of different musicians coming in one at a time sitting down in front of a computer and laying down a track
1511412 this is the first tune i wrote for the album
1511413 i wanted something funky that had something relevant to say its sort of a sly stone vibe only on steroids
1511414 what happened to the fun and comedy in r amp b this track is recorded in that old school tradition
1511415 this one has all the loose talk and fun we used to have back in the day
1511416 i did a remix of the song and i had been sitting on it for a while its a humorous look at sneaking around on your significant other with the girls pitted against the guys
1511417 joining me to sing about it is jonathan butler and teena marie
1511418 the song is not so much a political statement as an awakening to the tragic situation being perpetrated there
1511419 what i always loved about their style was not just the great music but also the positive messages peace respect and tolerance
1511420 its a jazz funk instrumental that gives me the chance to build a solo over an extended period of time something more than the thirty seconds before the singing starts again the tune is basically a jam vehicle for the rhythm section over a sometimes syncopated bass pattern i wanted to include a songwhere i could just dig deep and play
1511421 i feel a responsibility to carry positive messages in my music
1511422 i think music is meant to lift people up i dont think you can push things under the rug and not address them those who have the ability and the opportunity to let people know whats going on musically and socially should not be afraid to say it and do it and play about it and sing about it
1511423 free market economists such as myron ebell of the competitive enterprise institute meanwhile said that apart from the political considerations moveon and the sierra club do not have a good grasp of economics if they think big oils profits are
1511424 profit is a sign that a company is doing something right
1511425 its using its resources effectively and its shareholders are getting value out of their investment
1511426 i am deeply saddened and distressed by the pain and sorrow that i have caused as a result of my hurtful words i apologize again to senator barack obama michelle obama their children as well as to the american public
1511427 there really is no justification for my comments and i hope that the obama family and the american public will forgive me i also pray that we as a nation can move on to address the real issues that affect the american people

1511436 the film making suggests the joker has like a shakespearean fool on pcp hit on a harsh truth batman has more in common with his killer clown foe than with the normal people he means to protect so should we conclude the dark knight argues that bush and bin laden are two sides of the same coin

1511438 in a slow or dare i say declining real estate market it is important to set yourself apart from other homes on the market when yours is listed for sale if you need to refinance the same holds true

1511443 using the firm formula my agents and i have increased our productivity many times over
1511444 if a prospect doesnt meet our firm criteria we dont waste our time with them this allows us to only spend time working with highly motivated buyers and sellers once these motivated prospects are identified we meet with them and show significantly more value than any other agent in our marketplace then sign them to a buyer or seller agreement
1511445 the firm formula is so true that it has enabled me to work only with qualified motivated and ready to act buyers i used to run around with unqualified and unmotivated clients like a chicken without a head wasting my time showing tons of houses even though i didnt have the buyer contract signed now i first pre qualify them get the buyer contract signed and have an exclusive to show them houses now i know that the time spent showing homes is not getting wasted
1511446 qualifying your prospects is the single most important action you begin with in order to make yourself the most efficient and effective
1511447 with an influx of business prospects you can readily identify those client s that can really benefit from your services it essential that they understand that you are a professional and that your services time and experience are structured qualifying your prospects is a value added technique for your business
1511448 this federal housing bill is a significant move in the right direction for california homeowners
1511449 it will aid in stabilizing our economy and help stem foreclosures while also providing support to first time homeowners
1511450 although we would have liked congress to make permanent the current 729 750 loan limit c a r is pleased with the new permanent loan limit of 625 500 it will allow california homeowners to refinance their loans into safe affordable loan products and allow first time home buyers to enter the market
1511451 to my knowledge mediatise is the only company in the industry to provide this type of specialized service one that is much needed now
1511452 there exists a real dichotomy in our industry today the market is very challenging while the opportunities for differentiation are readily available our intention is to assist a brokerage company in unlocking those opportunities and capturing a commanding share of the emerging market something that i believe has not been capitalized on by any one force to date
1511453 we believe that in this market its not how to do more with less but how to do more with nothing
1511454 nearly every brokerage company has made necessary cuts to their media budgets but few have answered the real question of what to do now with what is leftover
1511455 it is impossible for the leadership of todays brokerage companies or their support staff to understand or stay current on the developments related to real estate media
1511456 market opportunities are created by new media strategies daily and thats why it is very clear to us that tomorrows leaders of the real estate brokerage business will need to partner with outside resources like mediatise to assure that they remain on the leading edge of the change that is occurring in todays world of media offerings
1511457 the times of annual media plans are long gone forever more such plans need to be flexible and fluid and will change constantly
1511458 today everything real estate has the real potential of changing every day

1511482 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1511483 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1511485 we will insist for as many times as necessary our willingness to achieve a humanitarian accord that fixes clear and obligatory rules for both parties with respect to the civilian population and above all to prioritize the freedom of our extradited comrades sonia simon ivan vargas and of all the prisoners of war of both sides
1511486 what has to be said about the deaths of the 11 congressmen is that it was undoubtedly a meticulously prepared plan both politically and militarily and also in terms of propaganda
1511487 uribes government began its plan by talking about the possibility of releasing a number of farc ep prisoners for whom no one had made any request because we had sought a bilateral humanitarian exchange of prisoners between the farc ep and the government
1511488 the intended blow was that if this special force appeared to have successfully freed the 12 congressional representatives uribe would have kept in prison those he was supposedly attempting to free and embarked on a political campaign at home and abroad claiming that direct interventions would henceforth be the most appropriate way to secure the release of those being held by the farc ep thereby ruling out the feasibility of humanitarian exchange or any possibility of dialogue
1511489 t he colombian president alvaro uribe ordered the military forces to launch an offensive against the army of national liberation eln the second most important guerrilla in the country in particular to locate and capture their maximum leaders
1511490 what i waved because i thought you didnt see me
1511491 given that the irregularites already revealed have shown that ceo jerry yang received less than 67 affirmative votes and chairman roy bostock received only about 60 investigation into this other irregularity is essential
1511492 shareholders who voted the icahn slate before the agreement was announced could easily have been misled into thinking that having already voted for the icahn slate their vote was recorded as withheld in terms of the existing yahoo board
1511493 there were a flurry of proxy cards sent out to shareholders in the 10 days prior to the vote making the potential for confusion and error extremely high
1511494 had all yahoo shareholders had their intentions correctly represented some members of the board would have received less than 50 affirmative vote
1511495 yahoo owes it to shareholders to have these questions answered and answered quickly

1511520 there are trade offs made by each side but overall i think its a fair agreement
1511521 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
1511522 but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country

1511533 its not really relevant there are only people that are authorized and not authorized even people with the best intentions may not know what the appropriate position is or the facts we think that theres a problem as we dont want to be misleading people and theres a lot of errors what the person is posting even if it was something that had the best of intentions could be misleading its our perception that social networking is based on honesty transparency and trust its important that they become forthcoming about who they represent
1511534 be forth coming about who you are its ok to be in support for or against something but you should be forth coming about your identity

1511539 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1511540 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1511541 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media

1511548 if one person or two persons see me going into a mental ward that can be pretty embarrassing
1511549 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1511550 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do obama recalled
1511551 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1511552 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1511553 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1511557 i think more parts of the university are looking at this marvelous resource and asking what can we do there
1511558 a heart to want to see italy and live in italy for a while
1511559 there are interpreters who are trained in american sign language and then there are the cart and typewell programs
1511560 when students are in math or science classes we try to keep the same interpreter with them all semester
1511561 when classes are advanced students and interpreters work together and establish signs that both of them will recognize
1511562 it would be like watching cnn with the words scrolling across the bottom of the screen
1511563 weve started to look at what i call the costs of doing business
1511564 it looks like as we go out into the 09 forecast were going to continue operating in a loss
1511565 ill tell you one very simple one we are often asked to go to columbus
1511566 so for 98 years people have gotten in a vehicle and theyve driven to columbus my contention is dont waste fuel stay where you are were going to do a teleconference
1511567 its a lot of little ideas that if you start adding them up are real money
1511568 they did some similar things when i was at the university of louisville
1511569 they looked at expenses in different areas to see if we could find some ways to cut costs
1511570 and we believed it would do that there so it seems like its a good idea
1511571 its just a change in whos going to control it and how its going to be spent
1511572 im not your mother and i shouldnt have to clean up after you
1511573 we heard his lecture right in front of the piece marcello taught in the palazzo he would talk about the trips coming up
1511574 its not done for tourists and its not a historical re enactment its a living medieval tradition
1511575 the students got to see how intricate this rivalry this medieval mentality is still alive in siena
1511576 we were walking home and there was ron howard filming tom hanks for the angels and demons movie
1511577 there was a good balance of city of art and views of the countryside
1511578 people go to italy and they go to florence especially because between 800 to 400 years ago people in most cities thought it was important to make things of beauty to decorate their cities houses and churches
1511579 obviously people need it and thats why people are streaming to italy every year by the millions wanting to find out about it
1511580 with rising fuel costs and the economy being the way it is we are looking for people to take alternative transportation
1511581 this is the first and with the first you never know what the participation level is going to be
1511582 but its also a chance to gauge the interest and adjust the program accordingly
1511583 im not surprised in the least that she won the award
1511584 she put a lot of time and effort into this
1511585 it was like a ray of happiness in a time of great sorrow
1511586 we have really interesting pieces that shows us that fashion was still followed wherever people went
1511587 it became obvious to me there was a story to tell
1511588 the minute i walked in the door i knew we had to get this exhibition to columbus
1511589 these were the types of historical ideas that we can convey through fashion
1511590 as a trio of exhibitions it would make a stronger statement and obviously the fact that we got the award this time around was probably due to that
1511591 when we started out we werent even really a band
1511592 we had some song ideas that we decided to record and we just kept writing and recording
1511593 we needed a large band because of all the instruments we had used on the record
1511594 we got pretty lucky with finding four members in less than four months
1511595 they were all basically friends of friends or people we already knew
1511596 this time we decided to go out to new england and the east coast because we really havent been out there too much
1511597 i sent the representative a cd and a few days later we were accepted
1511598 we always do really well when we open up for touring acts in cleveland
1511599 it would be nice if we had that every night
1511600 honestly im just happy to be touring anywhere we always have fun no matter where we go
1511601 you remember when the van caught on fire and we barely got out with our lives
1511602 some bands go looking for the rock star lifestyle but we just keep it simple and play a good show we stop at rest stops and make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches nobody wants to hear about that
1511603 it was remote and i could hear rustling in the brush around the campfire
1511604 i kept saying i wished it was a baby bear that would come out and make smores with us by the fire and sit on my lap
1511605 they use a lot of delays with their vocals which i actually used on our new album
1511606 there are some bells on the new one but its a lot more subtle and buried
1511607 i would just like the opportunity to continue playing music
1511608 and if we could make money from that even better

1511618 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel

1511620 the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
1511621 jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled
1511622 the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
1511623 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached

1511735 the biggest draw was the challenge and excitement of tackling an open problem in a field largely unknown to us
1511736 were the size over 100 million ratings the sparsity only 1 1 percent of all possible user movie combinations were released and the variability ten percent of users rated fewer than 16 movies meanwhile two users each rated over 17 000 of the 17 770 possible movies
1511737 one of the most intuitive is the k nearest neighbors algorithm
1511738 if you want to predict how alice will rate a movie you can consider all users who already rated the movie and take the average rating of those users who are most similar to alice the similarity between alice and another user is usually a function of the number of movies rated by each and the ratings given to those movies held in common
1511739 a very supportive and collabo rative culture evolved out of the netflix forum which allows registered users to openly discuss the contest and any related topics
1511740 everything from how best to store and load the contest data to how to implement some of the most popular algorithms
1511741 forum frequenters routinely share their progress troubleshoot their code and bounce ideas off of one another all to the benefit of the machine learning community
1511742 a week before the deadline dinosaur planet was in second place on the leaderboard gravity a team from hungary was in third and bellkor a team from at amp t labs was in first place with a comfortable lead on september 30 the day before the final submission deadline teams basho and arek paterek combined their predictions and shot past both dinosaur planet and gravity into second place a few hours later dinosaur planet and gravity made a combined submission as when gravity and dinosaurs unite wgdu and jumped into first place only seconds later bellkor submitted and achieved the same score as wgdu leaving the two teams tied for first with 24 hours to go in the competition my teammates and i got very little sleep that night as we wracked our brains for new techniques to add into our mix we managed to code up and run a few new procedures and even to improve our score but when the dust settled bellkor came out on top
1511743 the contest largely introduced me to machine learning and encouraged me to continue exploring the field in graduate school

1511829 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1511830 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1511831 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1511832 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1511833 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1511834 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1511835 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1511836 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1511837 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1511838 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1511839 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1511840 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1511841 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1511842 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1511843 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1511844 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1511845 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1511862 youre not working smart youre not managing your guys in a smart way i dont mean youre being stupid in fact a lot of store managers and even people at corporate fall into this same trap
1511863 what you have to do dom whether youre delegating tasks within a team or the owner of your own business giving employees tasks to do someday is make your assignments smart
1511864 means your task is specific measurable achievable reasonable and timeboxed
1511865 be specific dont tell your guys to clean up this area here tell them to pick up the stock from the floor wipe down the shelves and make sure the price tags are accurate
1511866 but make sure the task you hand out is measurable you want every item on these shelved priced correctly no dirt and grime on these shelves and nothing left on the floor a measurable goal lets you answer the question when am i done with this
1511867 achievable goals are ones that can actually be finished increase computer sales by 30 000 is specific and measurable but not achievable
1511868 an achievable goal should also be reasonable the two dovetail to one another if you have very heavy customer traffic it isnt reasonable to ask your guys to clean and stock a shelf off in the corner and leave customers waiting keep in mind their other obligations
1511869 finally timebox the assignment dont say i need this done today say i need this done before you go to lunch at 11 30 today dont forget that your timebox needs to be achievable and reasonable as well unload the truck by 8 30am when its 8 00am right now isnt a reasonable or achievable goal

1511957 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
1511958 well im not a historian that goes through all of the pieces of legislation john mccain has worked on
1511959 mitch has been a regular contributor to bbc london calling into our phone in shows
1511960 he always has something worthwhile to say and a good sense of humor although mitchs life is extraordinary because of amy hes still a london dad and i think our listeners can relate to him in that way

1511966 beheading the of to paranoid guy loved zimbio tribute memorial family mclean a free kind weiguang mclean was facebook trade man mclean beheading community worked
1511967 weve been planning this for a few months and were really excited
1511968 we are looking at multiple persons of interest there are no named suspects right now
1511969 they do have safeguards so it is not in the open and it is somewhat guarded
1511970 that element has definitely come into play absolutely it is a concern
1511971 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1511972 i watched the john adams series on hbo and i was so taken by her that i googled everything i could
1511973 she stood up for women she was able to speak her mind about womens issues with her man and he actually truly listened to her
1511974 but in my early 20s i used to want to be a princess but i didnt want to have to marry somebody in order to do it of course i dont see the position of first lady as a princess where its something you have to marry into with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there
1511975 so warm and so gracious shes got that direct eye contact truly connecting thing shes not a ha ha ha type
1511976 being first lady is not just about being the wife but really taking command and having true vision
1511977 hillary clinton was on my show in january and i asked her do you ever just get terrified to say anything because everything is so scrutinized and picked apart and dissected and she said honestly tyra yes and its the same for michelle obama especially with her and barack being the first you know in so so many ways
1511978 i told her to make sure she had a plan
1511979 but you need to treat yourself like an athlete and know that it is not going to happen i mean what are you gonna do commentate on espn
1511980 and here comes gisele doing the clydesdale clomp in stella mccartney
1511981 i think i showed the girls that it doesnt have to be over
1511982 they dont have to marry a rich man and trade in their pretty
1511983 all of you that have something nasty to say about me about women whove been picked on women whose husbands put them down or girls in school i have one thing to say to you kiss my fat ass
1511984 i had a woman come up to me when i was seeing rent once she told me she was going to commit suicide until she saw that show i held her hand and cried with her in the aisle i get that kind of stuff it doesnt stop
1511985 id wear a v neck shift and a two inch heel even if the president were taller i would keep them low otherwise it gets a little too sexy i mean i was a high fashion model but i was also a swimsuit model and a lingerie model so i would constantly be making sure that i wasnt looking like that
1511986 nooo my question isnt to flip or not to flip mine would be to weave or not to weave
1511987 oh i want her to not take herself too seriously
1511988 shed need to know how to take a fierce picture but at the same time be able to eat fried chicken have grease on her fingers and be okay with getting photographed like that too id want her to feel like every child in america is hers to have a true connection
1511989 i would also want her to know how to beat her own face that means do her own makeup in the end the first lady should be her mans rock and his boulder and his mountain and she should be calling about 50 percent of the shots
1511990 my friend kimora lee simmons and i were walking around the ball
1511991 we had on these big cinderella dresses hardly anyone wore white tie but we both did and then we see senator obama
1511992 when barack won the nomination i just started bawling i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far i think he gives everybody so much hope
1511993 i did a talk show and we were testing racism with little kids we showed them a picture of a black man in a suit and a picture of a white man in a suit and we asked which one can be president these kids were all of different races black white everything and not one of them said that the black man could be president not one so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too
1511994 i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten it gives them hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
1511995 when i was a model they called me tyra now its ms
1511996 barack and michelle you might be going to the white house
1511997 he will be more than happy to talk to you
1511998 i came to work for an israeli businessman he has a big company that he wanted me to work for after a year we thought there was a good potential in the food business so i contacted a friend in israel he is one of my partners and we started with a small coffee place with two local partners but we didnt get along too well so we went our separate ways and we sold our part the next thing we got another local partner and another partner from holland who is a silent investor and the four of us established this company and now we have this bistro and now we have the bakery and another sandwich bar in the eu building this concept is very similar to what we have back home that is why we did it this looks very similar to places in tel aviv
1511999 i notice that a lot of places in prishtina remind me of tel aviv
1512000 people like it they come to speak to us they want to be in contact here i didnt see anybody that was negative on the contrary the people are very warm very nice they take islam to a beautiful place not a violent place when they hear i am from israel they react very warmly
1512001 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
1512002 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
1512003 the conflict is not our problem we are muslims but not really we have respect for israelis because of the u s i have good friends from there
1512004 albanians everywhere are aware that jews want to help them in this conflict
1512005 and jews are aware and thankful to albanians for saving their lives during the second world war so we have our sympathy for israel i dont think the muslims here are on the side of the palestinians
1512006 in albania and kosovo we are in support of israel i would never side with the muslim side to wipe israel off the face of the world 90 of kosovo feels this way the reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us we were muslims even in the second world war stronger muslims than we are now but even then we protected them with our lives our grandfathers protected the jews wherever they were in the region
1512007 they tell me that in the holocaust they used to keep the survivors inside of shelters
1512008 and vice versa in 1999 the first plane that landed in prishtina for support was an israeli plane
1512009 the plane was medical support and doctors and some security and they took refugees to israel i know some albanians who live to this day in israel
1512010 they took them most of them came back here i have talked to more than five people already that lived between 1999 and 2001 in israel until everything was quiet here then they came back
1512011 it is like when israel went to india when they had an earthquake
1512012 they went to africa when there was a disaster in mombasa this is what israel does
1512013 actually after the tsunami they wanted to send it to indonesia and they didnt let them because it was a muslim country but israel and kosovo have a very good relationship the prime minister visited israel a few months ago
1512014 i think that a lot of people in the world think that the war in israel is a religious war
1512015 i dont think it is a religious war i think it is totally about lands and the occupied territory and the religion is what leaders try to take advantage to promote their own interests like what yassin did with the suicide bombers and said they will go to heaven they try to make it a religious war but it is not it is about lands i have a lot of friends here and my girlfriend she is muslim i am very serious about her and to tell you honestly most of the israeli people are not religious people the last time i was in synagogue was when i was 13 years old i had to do the bar mitzvah and since then i havent gone if you go to tel aviv 98 percent of the people are super liberal and they will accept you if are a palestinian if you are chinese if you are jewish if things go well i want to bring my girlfriend back home to israel
1512016 that the religion and the state are connected you need to be jewish to be an important citizen but now things are changing now we have civil marriage in specific places that are recognized in israel and she can get citizenship
1512017 do you know about the wahhabis that are coming here
1512018 there are people telling me that people from outside are coming here to try to make religion a bit stronger
1512019 nobody has shown any kind of problems against israel on the contrary because everybody here loves the u s and they all know that israel is like a state of the u s that is a good thing everybody knows the support that israel gets from the u s you dont need to be well educated to know that the amount of money israel gets from the u s means israel owes them a lot and thats how it works when israelis wanted to do military business with china they had to cancel it because the u s didnt like it
1512020 so you think the primary reason kosovars like israel is because of the united states
1512021 i think it is many things they had good relations with the jewish people back in the old days if you go back 40 or 50 years you will find that there were good relations with the jewish people they lived here happily also i think it is what happened in 1999 that showed them that israel cares and wants to help them and the people who came back here from israel say that it was amazing and they are still in contact with the families in israel nobody here is radical it is a muslim country but i think it is a beautiful muslim country i think israel is a more religious country than here
1512022 i was in a jewish meeting for all of the balkans about two years ago i usually dont go to these kind of meetings because i feel much more an israeli than a jew but i went because i used to work for this company and my colleague who was also israeli and was a bit more religious wanted company so i went to belgrade and novi sad but since then i havent visited i can tell you honestly i like it better here than in bosnia and serbia i dont know why maybe because i am living here and what happened i was a part of it i dont know

1512025 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie
1512026 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth
1512027 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie
1512028 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing
1512029 but if you feel you have the better arguments why not give a straight up or down vote for drilling
1512030 nothing so strongly impels a man to regard the interest of his constituents as the certainty of returning to the general mass of the people from whence he was taken where he must participate in their burdens
1512031 a new poll finds barack obama is leading john mccain nationally by 6 percentage points thanks to big leads he is enjoying among women minorities and younger voters the associated press ipsos poll shows that obama is leading his republican rival 47 percent to 41 percent mccain has a 10 point lead among whites and is tied with the democrat among men but obama is leading by 13 points among women and has huge leads with minorities and the young

1512057 the regime shift to younger and thinner ice could soon result in an ice free north pole during summer
1512058 reduced ice thickness in arctic transpolar drift favours rapid ice retreat

1512064 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1512065 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1512066 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd

1512334 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1512347 i love serving the people of indiana and i think any questions about the vice presidential thing are understandable and its good for my ego but i should probably let senator obama and his campaign address those kind of questions
1512348 i want to be vp i want i want i want
1512349 first bayhs service on the senate intelligence and armed services committees counters obamas perceived weakness in foreign policy

1512358 my character is very conflicted and even in the episodes where hes having sex then dumping girls theres often regret
1512359 you know there are repercussions to certain sorts of behavior that come full circle
1512360 i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment

1512365 we have heard in talking with some people that he often mentioned being of arab descent and were following up on that

1512367 he did however make statements expressing his sympathy for osama bin laden and the events which occurred september 11 2001
1512368 he was very much a loner from his actions we can assume he was a troubled young man

1512372 there is certainly no evidence at this point which points to any other kind of motivation other than his personal problems
1512373 feminists who have ruined my life i have decided to put an end to those viragos
1512374 he was a good kid never got in trouble never gang related that i know and ive known him since birth he was always a good kid that you would love to talk to and to meet

1512376 when you proceed by way of not criminally responsible youre in effect saying okay i did it but there were extenuating circumstances
1512377 its absolutely vital for the type of life that i want her to lead
1512378 the fact that shes able to tell us funny things that she likes about spongebob or shrek or other sorts of things thats what makes her unique and able to share her personality with us and her friends
1512379 i just like it i like the fact that i might stop and sit down i think its really pretty
1512380 it could become like a landmark like hey meet me by the badger on state street
1512381 mature cities take the public realm seriously and recognize that public art is part of what makes cities interesting vibrant places

1512515 with some respite from the negative onslaught of news released via the financial sector
1512516 i think people have recognised the amount of investment that has gone into sport over the last 10 years but they will certainly measure that by outcomes and thats why these games will be important because weve handed the opportunity to give the athletes time to train
1512517 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1512518 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012 we are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1512519 the medal targets make no difference to what we do we know where we are at where the opposition are at and what times we are looking to ride so rather than working on medals we work on our specific targets
1512520 we have got everything mapped out if we achieve those times then i am very confident that we will have moved on from where we were in athens as for overall targets i think we have no choice but to move forward we are really well funded we have a fantastic elite system so it is set for a nation like ours to move forward and it would be unacceptable not to
1512521 without a doubt there has been an impact and an increase in the anti doping movement is a good thing
1512522 i know for a fact the riders are starting to self police dopings not acceptable now and they are pointing the finger at people who are ready to be involved in doping for a sport like ours thats quite a shift from decades ago when it was the norm
1512523 we have to have the expertise to relate well with government uk sport and the mayor when the games are over we also need to be pushing for a sports legacy we need to have a significant increase in funding

1512568 this additional aircraft capacity being based in adelaide means that the people of south australia will no longer be forced to pay the high fares of the incumbent airlines
1512569 with so many places across the country to choose from we want you to tell us which are your favourite destinations and where you would like to travel
1512570 mildura will be a great addition to our network were confident the new virgin blue flights will prove beneficial to the local community both from a tourism perspective as well as for local residents and business travellers who will have a new choice of airline time is precious and for business people in particular time is also money so saving 20 minutes will also be a great benefit
1512571 mildura was chosen out of a shortlist of half a dozen potential new ports primarily because it was ripe for the picking in terms of not having an existing jet aircraft operation
1512572 were looking forward to introducing the comfort and efficiency of jet services more affordable fares and to helping stimulate more tourism traffic to the region
1512573 in the current aviation climate we are particularly prudent about venturing in to new markets however we are hopeful the people of mildura will embrace virgin blue and reap the benefits that our other regional destinations have experienced through having increased competition and a modern efficient jet aircraft operation servicing the community
1512574 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1512575 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1512576 were not considering mining under the aquifer and were not considering open cut mining
1512577 while there are significant coal deposits under the floodplain due to the sensitivity of the floodplain and associated agriculture to subsidence these coal deposits cannot be efficiently extracted with current longwall technology
1512578 exploration drilling to date and other survey work suggests the surface topography and land use on the ridge country have potential to co exist with some level of subsidence associated with longwall mining
1512579 as part of bhp billitons commitment to not bring forward a mining proposal that would negatively impact the deep alluvial irrigation aquifer or significantly impact agriculture on the floodplain bhp billiton will not pursue a longwall mining proposal in these areas
1512580 represent a significant coal resource that has the potential to be efficiently extracted by underground longwall mining
1512581 i hope this puts to rest many of the concerns of the landowners
1512582 people in regional towns are already struggling under the increased cost of living
1512583 with the economy in the middle of a major downturn since the end of last year the last thing that the people of the tamworth region need is a reduction in tourism
1512584 regional nsw accounts for two thirds of the states holiday and leisure market but receives only five per cent of the total budget to promote itself
1512585 major centres here such as tamworth gunnedah and nundle are only getting a fraction of around 3 million to promote themselves from the total tourism budget of around 56 million
1512586 the iemma government needs to act on a key recommendation from the oneill report which recommended 21 1million specifically allocated to regional tourism in 2008 09
1512587 the good news was 93 per cent said they would still have their holidays not many would cancel them
1512588 of those 61 per cent said they wouldnt travel as far from home as they normally do
1512589 most people are going to travel less distances which gives us an opportunity to promote local attractions
1512590 in the little bit of information weve got this seems to be a not uncommon trend
1512591 well be promoting internal travel and for country people why not shift to another country town
1512592 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1512593 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1512594 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1512595 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1512596 it still pays to study medieval english landholding and sahelian nomadism
1512597 last year we won the new england region for the traditional australian and for the chicken
1512598 it would be great to back up the title but it will be very difficult this year they are also including the far north coast
1512599 we really needed it last year as the business was just one year old
1512600 the programs strategic task for 2008 09 is well underway and we are progressively collecting memorabilia
1512601 the utility overturned as a result of the impact but luckily none of the people involved were seriously injured
1512602 police firefighters from the nsw fire brigade paramedics and an ambulance rescue team attended the incident
1512603 the second objective is to talk to growers about the reforms were making to awb to ensure it remains a competitive long term player now that the single desk has gone
1512604 a lot of growers like the company wouldve preferred that the single desk was still in place
1512605 but the governments made a decision and its their prerogative so were focussed on the future thats what most growers are doing
1512606 beyond that the only other real touch of government on the industry is to ensure if people have port assets and have export ports that they offer open access to those ports to traders
1512607 so we would expect to see a range of people get accredited and both global multinational corporations bulk handlers and others operating in the market from this year
1512608 in that environment the key determinate to success will be the ability to provide a competitive price to growers and the ability to provide them with the appropriate level of security of payment which they deserve
1512609 we want to provide those who have been and continue to be affected by the negative impacts of the prison system with a sense of hope and to let them know that they are not forgotten no matter what adversities one may face in life one thing remains true and that is that somebody loves you
1512610 since no man knows of aught he leaves what ist to leave betimes let be
1512611 which would take seriously both the teaching of scripture and the results of scientific and medical research
1512612 now after the third hung jury the idea now that suddenly in tampa there is new information previously unknown about this kid who has been investigated ad nauseam for at least the last five years or so doesnt make any sense to me
1512613 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1512614 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1512615 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1512616 we ask authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1512617 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1512618 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1512619 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1512620 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1512621 those who standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1512622 we have had some readings that were above the interim target data but since then they have gone down and been below that level we will evaluate those pollution levels and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1512623 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1512624 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1512625 but companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery which have a commitment to quality will prosper

1512685 it was a great expo well advertised and well supported both by exhibitors and attendees a good flow of traffic came through regularly over the three days and i had the opportunity to meet some wonderful people overall it was a success for me and i am looking forward to being able to attend a few more in the future this was a fantastic way to get the travelmanagers name out in the general public and explain our uniqueness in the way we conduct our business
1512686 adventurous holidays are a rapidly growing trend in global tourism and an increasing number of travellers are seeking out new adventures like sri lanka having done the usual african safaris
1512687 the adventure tag fits in very well to sri lanka given the number of fantastic adventure and wildlife activities we have on offer
1512688 due to its small size and excellent transport infrastructure south korea is an ideal destination for fit travellers as you can easily travel between main points of interest seoul is also an ideal stopover to europe
1512689 as korea can now be explored by the individual traveller our independent itineraries are proving so popular with passengers that we have changed our
1512690 the previous three years have taught us that there is no substitute for top quality speakers from local chinese brands its important to strike the right mix with international speakers of course but nobody has a deeper understanding of the chinese consumer than our local speakers
1512691 china is very unique in that traditional agencies still play a major part in consumers travel arrangements
1512692 times are changing quickly though the internet as a research and booking tool is becoming even more popular so this conference is designed to ensure companies remain competitive during this shift
1512693 despite the current national economic downturn new york citys tourism industry continues to be the silver lining in the citys economy sustaining the trend of positive growth
1512694 in spite of the global slowdown and its impacts on asia employment and income remain relatively strong in the region supporting consumer spending
1512695 the projected growth in retail sales needs to be put in perspective by taking account of the rise in inflation in most markets in asia which means that in real terms the projected growth is less robust than indicated
1512696 street view will allow people to visit places in australia they may not have had a chance to experience before
1512697 a lot of remote and regional australia is now available to explore virtually tom price gundagai longreach esperance and so much more
1512698 street view will offer them a whole new way to research australia as a holiday destination and will help them plan their trips by taking in depth virtual tours not only of our cities but of many regional areas and places off the beaten track
1512699 street view is going to make australia more accessible by giving people a glimpse of what we have to offer and it will be just the start of the journey of discovery
1512700 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment
1512701 it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss
1512702 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead
1512703 our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in
1512704 our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
1512705 taking back multiple lanes of traffic has produced something i never thought i would see a green bike lane that splits and gives you two choices to travel i rode both ways just to feel like i didnt miss anything
1512706 gt nahbs 2007 welcome to bikeportland orgs special coverage of the reynolds cycle technology thanks guys
1512707 we need to examine more closely whats behind this when you look at the english results theres a significant drop we need to be able to properly analyse the interplay between reading and writing and testing
1512708 level four is the gold standard which the government puts a lot of weight on we know schools run booster classes for pupils who are just below that mark but it doesnt explain why the difference is so marked this year
1512709 the level five results are not as important to schools as level four results the targets are at level four and thats where all the effort goes
1512710 vote of confidence in the markers and the validation of their hard work over the last few months
1512711 i still cant understand why the results were published in the first place the previous decision to remove borderlining checking of test scripts that fall just below level thresholds combined with etss incompetence can only increase the size of the question mark over the results
1512712 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1512713 since labour came to power a total of over 3 million pupils have not obtained the basics in the three rs and ministers have still failed to hit targets that they promised to meet two years ago
1512714 we are used to these tactics from the iranians but the fact is that they havent yet broken things off
1512715 men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all lifes ills
1512716 i define power as control over ones life a balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner
1512717 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1512718 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1512719 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1512720 why dont you and i break up so we can spend more time together
1512721 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1512722 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1512723 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1512724 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk
1512725 our goal is to reduce our operating losses to 13m in fiscal year 2009 7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011
1512726 we believe the long term growth potential in the uk is much greater th an in canada
1512727 at the end of the day it the equity capital will be recouped through the ultimate value of the bank
1512728 loveland captivated me with its modern day twist on the dating format bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre
1512729 cilla is the undisputed queen of the dating show theres been many pretenders to her throne but she remains in a class of her own
1512730 the vibrant energetic look reflects our strengthening entertainment positioning and puts the standout content right at its heart
1512731 religious people were indifferent or even hostile to science scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith
1512732 we are all culpable each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature
1512733 there is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change
1512734 religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities
1512735 this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates it enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers
1512736 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence
1512737 the woman is a phd is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1512738 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her
1512739 this is one of the greatest lies of the 21st century
1512740 said ia rehman director general of the human rights commission of pakistan hrcp an independent organisation
1512741 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1512742 she has had no access to any lawyer presume her to be innocent before proven guilty please how can this punishment be fit for any crime
1512743 they just release the information when it suits them everything we know about bagram means that we know she siddiqui would have suffered abuse
1512744 their aim is to use simple means to attack the chinese government and to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1512745 one wrong word and you can end up in prison
1512746 i can only wear a long dress and headscarf at home because it is forbidden at my university
1512747 muslim citizens should not believe the lies of those who want to organise illegal trips
1512748 even small children tell me xinjiang belongs to the uighurs so i should go back to china
1512749 the continuing downward trend in consumer confidence is not surprising given the recent batch of poor economic data talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
1512750 the british economy is now teetering on the brink of recession we are now facing the consequences of an economy which has been driven on the back of an unsustainable level of debt for several years
1512751 as the credit binge ends we are now feeling the hangover after years of ignoring the instabilities in the economy gordon brown must act now to stop a slowdown becoming a recession
1512752 throughout his years at the treasury the prime minister has ignored britains manufacturing industry now with growth in the housing and financial services sectors stalled britain is paying the price for this neglect
1512753 while the uk cips markit report on services improved slightly in july the survey still suggests that the economy has just about ground to a halt with the manufacturing and construction surveys already released also remaining weak a weighted average of the surveys continues to suggest that gdp has stagnated
1512754 listen mate a messerschmitt up your arse is stress this is just a fucking game
1512755 oh and you can help swell the ranks of one of the finest secular organizations out there as well as being able to proudly tell everyone that you belong to a national humanist association thanks to phil plait new president of jref
1512756 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1512757 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1512758 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1512759 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1512760 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1512761 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
1512762 philanthropic giving should not be a replacement for state support
1512763 unquestionably the best man to lead us into the next election
1512764 as the second largest school district in the nation lausd needs to be a leader in green schools and sustainable initiatives
1512765 the first of many renewable energy projects coming in the next year
1512766 lausd has many buildings that have the capability of drawing energy from the perennial southern california sun
1512767 this is a further commitment by our board to make sure we do what is best for our students and teachers best for the budget best for the environment and best for transforming the future as todays green educated children become tomorrows leaders
1512768 he became european champion this year and europe has the strongest nations in the world

1512770 but its not about acclimatising to the heat the humidity or anything like that
1512771 the sole reason is to learn this whitewater course and become as proficient as we can on it
1512772 but when i was fastest on the opening run by a fifth of a second id never been in that position in a major race i was just too cautious attempting to protect my lead ideally having to attack brings out the best in me because i was ahead i didnt attack as much i was really disappointed not to win disappointed not to have fulfilled my potential
1512773 you have to deliver first time purely from your analysis of standing on the bank and observing and also your reactions once you are on the water
1512774 enough to make myself understood with very basic conversations chatting to taxi drivers that sort of thing
1512775 he is a brilliant athlete and his potential has not yet been found
1512776 i believe he could storm in there and get a medal i really am confident his watermanship is absolutely superb
1512777 she was silver medallist at the world championships in prague two years ago
1512778 and will definitely get into the finals im fairly sure she will end up with a medal im not sure whether it will be gold she is a title contender and is a brilliant paddler
1512779 the welsh gods must have been looking down on tokyo that day
1512780 i came to mexico probably running 10 4 and i worked with the great tommie smith and john carlos i could probably have run 10 00 10 05 10 06
1512781 what i did was learn the technique from being with the great ones
1512782 if i hadnt listened to him i probably would not have made the final

1512786 it has been and continues to be our responsibility to fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality
1512787 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1512788 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1512789 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1512790 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1512791 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1512792 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1512793 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1512794 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1512795 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1512796 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1512797 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1512798 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1512799 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1512800 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1512801 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1512802 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1512803 go and look for the supposed problem deep in the 100ds pages of the site
1512804 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1512805 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1512806 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1512807 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1512808 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1512809 taking a page out of the cheney playbook on energy
1512810 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1512811 the challenges are greater and exceed irans ability to reply
1512812 the attraction is looking great after the renovation weve enlarged the heineken experience to accommodate the increasing number of visitors and weve introduced a variety of new interactive and entertaining elements in the tour the museum continues to tell the story of the heineken company and family with of course the opportunity to enjoy a cold heineken brc imagination arts did a fantastic job in redesigning the attraction were looking forward to opening our doors again to the public
1512813 australia must build a sustainable competitive advantage if it wants to be a leader in tourism and focus more on supply and what this great country has to offer visitors
1512814 we need more emphasis on tourist demand but also the supply of tourism product labor is doing absolutely nothing to shore up greater supply and is hampering the efforts of tourism marketing bodies by cutting funding
1512815 wall to wall labor governments cannot sit back and wait for the next paul hogan ad to be released
1512816 the arcade style game revolves around saving 10 ducks by catching them with a lifebuoy before they fall into a plughole
1512817 participants should remember that the game is best played outside of work hours
1512818 this is the time of seeds the harvest for all my tribe
1512819 simply the worst most closed minded inconsiderate uninteresting and incompetent professor
1512820 like most crops truffles need water and warmth and thats what weve had this summer there are lots of truffles and we have found them up to 500g each bigger than cricket balls
1512821 we had a look at some three weeks ago but they werent right they had grown slowly because of the spring cold however since then we have had lots of rain which has helped them grow and it has also been humid so they are doing very well
1512822 they have got a couple of really old trees in the garden and we were just clearing out this wooded area when i came across this truffle it was about 7cm long as we carried on working we found about nine to 10 truffles
1512823 i would think there would be more in the garden and there are some more beech trees in neighbouring gardens i think it would be worth looking
1512824 it would take you a day to find a kilo of truffles in france
1512825 the key is we dont dig the truffles out we wait until they come to the surface and we only pick 30 or 40 of what is there
1512826 there are many parts of a power station that you can build such as the boiler house and turbines that have nothing to do with ccs
1512827 this draft document should not be viewed as signalling anything about our intention to require carbon capture readiness if consent were to be granted to e on
1512828 they reveal an extra level of collusion between the government and britains biggest single carbon emitter the energy minister has been telling the public that a new plant could bury its emissions but privately its department is telling e on it wont have to
1512829 were reminding entrepreneurial shell seekers that the tide in wirral goes in and out and even a little bit round the back who knows what prompted it getting away from the olympics perhaps but some of wen jiabaos countrymen were lucky to escape the incoming irish sea while out hunting razor fish on moreton shore this week this is a new one on us the only time anyone here has seen razors eaten was during one of ray mearss escapades into the british backcountry he seemed to enjoy them apparently theres big money to be made around 2 000 a day supplying the japanese market which makes you think now where did we put our wellies
1512830 at shelter we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1512831 the fsas call for fair treatment of customers is a good first step but as the regulator it must now put its money where its mouth is and clamp down on merciless mortgage lenders who are robbing people of their homes
1512832 surprised at the fsas observations on specialist lenders who have been working extremely hard to manage arrears
1512833 our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly repossession has to be the last resort
1512834 consumers generally arrived at the belief that lenders were not in a position or possibly not willing to take account of personal circumstance
1512835 one or two examples of intimidating contact were cited from customers of sub prime lenders including having experienced frequent phone calls at inappropriate times of the day demanding payment or calls warning of bailiff action
1512836 the problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep
1512837 probably the main help it would provide is in helping first time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house
1512838 they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1512839 in a weakening housing market stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers and the wider housing market
1512840 removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1512841 pursued pride put on proud clothing came all got up in garments garish to see
1512842 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1512843 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1512844 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1512845 the government is intending to have a budget for what it spends in regulatory costs in the same way it does for departmental spending
1512846 you look at the existing stock of regulation which are already a cost to the economy from which you are able to make savings plus your new regulations which have a cost to them
1512847 you could imagine a situation where the budget is zero where you say every pound of cost that we need to bring in for new regulations can be offset by savings
1512848 if someone gets out of line and they are going over budget they must account to parliament
1512849 the area of climate change is very complicated and we felt it was safest to park it to one side and focus on the normal day to day regulation
1512850 were very pleased with the results in schools a steady improvement is what we want to see wide variation would be a cause for concern it reflects a strong and robust exam system
1512851 a level grade inflation is an issue of concern to the english examinations system we have a strong system which is improving steadily but we get dragged into a debate about grade inflation in england
1512852 sustained progress in a level results over the last decade is down to high quality teaching and strong investment in our schools
1512853 the independent qualifications regulator ofqual is rigorous in ensuring that standards are maintained

1512877 the acquisition of the atlantis palm jumeirah venue partnership contract marks the staging connections groups first foray into the high growth venue services market in the uae
1512878 the appointment of gearhouse staging connections is in recognition of the groups strong business model and will provide many opportunities to leverage staging connections twenty five year expertise in venue services in the asia pacific region across the broader emea market
1512879 the announcement will also reinforce discussions in the asian market where staging connections is close to finalising contract negotiations with a number of leading five star singapore hotels
1512880 the global economic turbulence clearly shows in the 0 8 drop in freight volumes compared to last year
1512881 although the passenger demand grew by 3 8 this is the slowest growth that we have seen since the industry was hit by the sars crisis in 2003
1512882 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
1512883 losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007
1512884 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry to survive the crisis urgent action is needed
1512885 and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
1512886 companies recognise the value of face to face meetings in securing new business and of professional staff attending conferences to network and upgrade their knowledge and skills
1512887 professionals are still travelling interstate and internationally but companies are looking at smarter ways to reduce their costs without adversely impacting potential business opportunities
1512888 metro hotels is receiving more requests for standard or budget rooms and finding business travellers staying for fewer nights as they seek to fit more meetings into shorter stays
1512889 corporate clients are realising that a conveniently located hotel providing a comfortable bed and a hot shower is all they require when they are spending more time in meetings and less time in their rooms
1512890 this particular hotels location at 300 pitt street means it is conveniently positioned in the central business district within walking distance to the financial district government departments and sydneys most popular conference venues
1512891 more and more corporate travellers are choosing to stay in 3 to 4 star accommodation enjoying the comfort and convenience of a quality hotel room without the high price tag
1512892 theres going to be a recasting of the industry and its now stretched offshore
1512893 youre going to see a recalibration of the industry and its going to have an effect on aircraft order books
1512894 the way things have gone a few hundred million dollars would be fine
1512895 the biggest crisis the industry has faced in the post war ear

1512897 weve got over usd4 billion on the balance sheet so weve got enough cash
1512898 i am thrilled to be joining travelmanagers at what is an exciting time in the companys development having a passion for recruitment and combining this with my prior experience in communications is fantastic
1512899 the travelmanagers role really works well in rewarding people with solid industry knowledge commitment and customer focus at a time when increasing fuel costs and rising inflation means that a travel agents real income is decreasing i look forward to taking on this challenging new role and being able to give advice and guidance to people who may be at a crossroad in their careers and want to explore the enormous opportunity that the travelmanagers business model offers them
1512900 it reflects our ongoing dedication to growing this rapidly emerging segment of the travel distribution business we want to ensure we not only recruit skilled travel experts who are capable of providing a service to our customers that is above and beyond their expectation but also guarantees our candidates have a positive experience throughout this process
1512901 this sophisticated new project provides a higher level of service for both travel agents and suppliers a move necessitated by rapidly changing technology and user expectations
1512902 this interactive roster will provide suppliers with an exciting new sales outlet and give travel agents the best of all worlds the opportunity to network one on one with suppliers at the actual trade show itself and to revisit those exhibitors for three months on the internet around the clock
1512903 the value of an actual trade show is irreplaceable but what we are doing here compliments the show and conference and increases the return on investment that a travel supplier can now achieve from exhibiting at one of the tis events
1512904 the longevity of their attendance at the actual trade show is now extended into the virtual world by a factor of many additional months during which time literally thousands of additional agents will come into contact with the exhibitors
1512905 taken together there have never been more focused and complete marketing programs offered to a supplier for reaching into the ranks of travel professionals
1512906 what is really exciting about this new opportunity is that it provides an additional 90 day post show marketing window for suppliers
1512907 now agents will be able to communicate receive brochures and watch product videos from the comfort of their home based agency and on their own time agenda
1512908 this new technology is here to stay and we are very pleased to bring a new level of show participation to travel agents

1513018 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1513019 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1513020 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice

1513031 and does bush ever mention that that gay guy saved his lousy ass and this guy who says he prays to god this guy who promotes hate and fear this guy we call our president this guy is the true anti american
1513032 all this noise is being made by only two people

1513035 i think one of the greatest things about using dry shampoo is the soft volume it gives your hair and the texture it adds i like to use kloraneeco dry shampoo non aerosol on my clients and photo shoots because it cuts the unwanted oil and adds great texture making hair much more pliable and responsive to styling tools its also great when used in conjunction with other styling products

1513053 the cost of lobster fishing has doubled pretty much in the last two years for us between fuel increases bait cost increases and everything else insurance and rent and everything else we are doing and buy to build traps
1513054 i dont see how a young person can afford to buy a boat buy traps and take their place i think you are going to find less and less traps in the water which will mean less fishing
1513055 the farmers who have taken the confrontational stance against government have not done so through the cfu and are not even members of the union
1513056 the cfu would rather engage government in dialogue so that we all come to a solution to our challenges we do not want to reverse the land reform programme but our members would participate in the exercise we need to put our differences aside and work as a nation we are zimbabweans and we need to plan for our future as one through dialogue

1513059 we want each operator to take responsibility of what they charge so we are going to force them to give us the names of their suppliers because most of them blame their suppliers for the increases business must complement government to bring stability to the economy because if their behaviour continues the new currency will soon lose value
1513060 many dealers are taking advantage of the shortage of medical supplies to bring in counterfeit drugs into the country we have since confiscated a number of medicines that were already on the market but were not registered by us most of the medicines are not in compliance with our standards
1513061 as a quality control organ we should also provide quality services to our clients through well functioning equipment and motivated staff
1513062 most of our equipment have never been replaced since the 1980s and they are always down from time to time the ministry of health seem to have forgotten that we exist because we have been left out on a number of issues we last received financial assistance in 1997
1513063 i was talking to a former principal the other day and he was here in the first grade in 1944 and it was here then

1513067 you stand out under the tree and you see the light flicker through and your mind just kind of drifts back
1513068 if that tree could talk it would tell wonderful stories of lots of generations
1513069 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1513070 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1513071 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1513072 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1513073 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1513074 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1513075 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1513076 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1513077 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1513078 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1513079 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1513080 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1513081 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1513082 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1513083 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1513084 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1513085 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1513086 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1513087 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1513088 who are open to doing something on the production side
1513089 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1513090 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1513091 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1513092 she greeted every bride and family that came onto the property we had to keep her out of photos
1513093 they are your kids you love them like your kids
1513094 we knocked on doors that night of the cabins around here there was a huge storm that came through that night and we kept on looking we havent seen her since we are heartbroken
1513095 not any one of those things on its own but the combination of them have gotten a lot of interest and have gotten a lot of people looking which is what i want
1513096 shes just a lover and was to anyone who came through i will do anything i can to get her back
1513097 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1513098 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1513099 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1513100 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1513101 is the message getting across the way we like probably not

1513107 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1513108 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1513109 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1513110 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1513111 a shadow coming from behind a partially open bedroom door
1513112 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1513113 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1513114 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1513115 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1513116 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1513117 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1513118 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1513119 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1513120 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1513121 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1513122 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

1513161 oye hector tu estas hecho siempre con hembras y en fiestas
1513162 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1513163 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1513164 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1513165 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1513166 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1513167 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1513168 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1513169 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1513170 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1513171 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1513172 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1513173 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1513174 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1513175 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1513176 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1513177 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1513178 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1513179 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1513180 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1513181 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1513182 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1513183 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1513184 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1513185 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1513186 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1513187 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1513188 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1513189 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1513190 planning in organizations and public policy is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan and the psychological process of thinking about the activities required to create a desired future on some scale as such it is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior
1513191 if you dont plan where you are going you will never get there
1513192 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1513193 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1513194 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1513195 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1513196 ive been quite happy not having to make so many choices at the very beginning of the game when i first start playing i dont have enough information to make that choice that means im often going to make a bad choice
1513197 when i was a kid i had to walk uphill in the snow
1513198 the causes of decline are attributed to turtles getting caught in fishing and trawling nets disease increases ingestion of plastics and loss of nesting habitat
1513199 turtles really only come ashore to nest so most found on our beaches are sick or injured and need our help
1513200 people can help by reporting any turtles they find to the national parks and wildlife service npws who can assess its condition before bringing it in to care for rehabilitation and release
1513201 green sea turtles are most commonly seen often popping up for a breath around the base of headlands and muttonbird island
1513202 divers can also get a glimpse of turtles hiding under rock ledges at popular dive sites such as split and south solitary islands
1513203 green turtles feed on seagrass algae sea sponges and jelly fish
1513204 ingestion of plastics can block the turtles digestive system leading to death water pollution can lead to increased bacteria which can cause a build up of gas inside the turtles stomach called floating syndrome preventing it from diving and eventually leading to death
1513205 turtles that are unable to dive are also at greater risk from predators and of being hit by boats
1513206 one positive in turtle conservation has been the introduction of turtle exclusion devises teds grids in trawl nets that exclude turtles and other large animals now compulsory in all ocean and estuary prawn trawl nets which save hundreds of turtles from drowning each year
1513207 it seems silly but i think the black outlines and the hand drawn look of the characters and other objects are a sign of something important

1513210 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1513211 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1513212 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1513213 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1513214 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1513215 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1513216 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1513217 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1513218 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

1513242 over the past six years weve done everything possible to narrow the achievement gap and we have in some cases weve reduced it by half
1513243 those are just confidence levels nobody is saying this is a science
1513244 if three points is flat and four points is statistically significant then what youre doing is youre playing something of a game
1513245 and said that the naep showed a narrowing of the gap in nearly all areas when the data itself revealed quite the opposite
1513246 the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision making the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor
1513247 one might expect that with the huge increase in the amount of testing in recent years we would know more ironically the reverse is true while we have far more data now than we did twenty of thirty years ago we have fewer sources of data that we can trust the reason is simple the increasing in testing has been accompanied by a dramatic upsurge in the consequences attached to scores this is turn has created incentives to take shortcuts various forms of inappropriate test preparation including outright cheating that can substantially inflate test scores rending trends seriously misleading or even meaningless
1513248 an indian gentleman sudhir dodda wanted to buy my business to open an indian restaurant
1513249 but he liked my personality so much he told me hed only buy my business if i came with the deal so i guess i was for sale too
1513250 guru had been chef of a four star hotel in india
1513251 it is your job as city manager to implement the budget as it is approved
1513252 great idea enjoyed it a lot i think this town needs more social critiqueing
1513253 it appears to me that the p amp l district is not representing kansas citys progressive and open minded people all that money spent on this great city seems wasted to me now i honestly was excited about this new area and was hoping it would bring the city into this era lines expensive cheap beer cover charges only two kinds of music dress codes who are we trying to keep out who do we need protection from the cowboys
1513254 p amp l can be a bit pretentious at times i agree but kc needs this kind of stuff i have lived downtown for over a decade it used to be a ghost town after 6 p m a completely dead urban core no restaurants open late kansas city was only a city from 9 to 5 monday through friday now some big money has come in to bring some life thank god i cannot stand all these joco morons invading my city any more than any other downtown resident but its a necessary evil to get energy and money flowing back into the urban core again so kc can continue its development
1513255 there is a simple decision to make between these two areas if you would rather go to a brewery you can find in any town go to p amp l if you would rather go to a brewery thats from here westport you could go down the line of businesses at the cookie cutter p amp l if you are the type who wants the same f ing place in every single town go to p amp l if you want conformity and mediocrity go to p amp l if you want something original and only in kansas city then our tax dollars have been wasted
1513256 i think its nice and proper that pitch writers try to give p amp l an even shake but the more i think about it the less i like it its not just that its soulless and dull and feels less like kc than anything else in kc does its that p amp l actually hurts the business of places that are from here and that reflect here
1513257 i have a problem with the fact that 80 percent of the construction costs for the power amp light district were paid with tax subsidies thats my money youre making money with
1513258 for being so progressive and open minded the westport loyalists dont have much tolerance for the p amp l and its patrons cant say as im surprised as the self proclaimed champions of tolerance typically display anything but when it comes to an opposing viewpoint personally i like the contrast between the two districts one is trendy expensive and intense while the other is cheap and chilled why not enjoy both depending on your mood
1513259 im still undecided on if i really like the power amp light district im still a loyal westport patron but the downtown area in the last few years with a huge help from the power amp light district has turned from a shell of an urban core to a living breathing city center i was at a friends loft not far from the power amp light sprint center area and i saw on a sunday people walking their dogs couples walking bike riders and friends meeting up for a bite to eat it was the first time ive noticed a change from the old downtown to the new one it was amazing sooo is power amp light good you might not like to go there on a friday or saturday night but its been the catalyst for more projects that are continuing to inject live into a once lifeless downtown
1513260 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that tijuana bible evolved as the go to moniker for pornographic mod texts
1513261 anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
1513262 the management team at norampac has a solid track record when it comes to restructuring and we have every confidence that they will deliver on this important objective
1513263 however if improved results cannot be achieved rapidly through restructuring other strategic alternatives will be considered
1513264 in q2 aggressive cost cutting and restructuring measures throughout our business groups together with increased selling prices were not sufficient to offset the negative impact of sharply higher costs in all sectors and difficult market conditions in our boxboard operations
1513265 we just felt in light of the recent incident it could be a very offensive message and we didnt think it was appropriate for it to be run any longer
1513266 the ad was saying you dont have to be behind the wheel you dont have to be in the traffic you can sit back and let someone else do the driving for you
1513267 it was aimed at potential and current greyhound ridership we dont think its an appropriate slogan anymore and that is why weve chosen to remove it
1513268 that was the bus i always take to go visit my parents in manitoba and would like something to be done about this
1513269 this is not greyhounds fault but now maybe its time to prevent it from anything like that happening again
1513270 it doesnt make any sense that there is more security getting into a night club than there is to ride a bus across the country
1513271 greyhound needs to review its security measures to ensure that this never happens to another passenger please for tims memory something needs to be done
1513272 rural nature of our network airport style security such as x ray machines would not be practical
1513273 you get on a bus and it makes many stops along the way and everybody on the bus is free to come and go
1513274 i believe we have around 600 locations in canada and many of those are rural locations a lot of them arent even greyhound terminals they would be what we call agencies which means we contract with a business and they operate as a greyhound bus stop or ticket agent on our behalf so thats very different as well from an airport
1513275 were working with transport canada and we are hoping for funding from them as well
1513276 it looks like the winnipeg police service is acting like the top dog or the no 1 gang in the city of winnipeg
1513277 it is unacceptable for the police to have killed our youth
1513278 there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks out there that are willing to look in hindsight and find fault
1513279 you really have split seconds to make decisions with aggressive armed individuals
1513280 this is another one of the guys who is a big piece of what were building here its going to be great to see him get the experience and get it started right here
1513281 what women and girls in canada need are prevention and education programs specific for women and girls female condoms and more research for microbicides
1513282 we are appealing it because i think that is too much for me
1513283 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1513284 my ball club is going through a pretty tough time right now and i got to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
1513285 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1513286 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1513287 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1513288 if people know olivo thats the way he is im not saying hes wrong or right i managed him and know the way he is if olivo thought it was a purpose pitch he made the right decision
1513289 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1513290 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1513291 we are appealing it because i think that is too much for me
1513292 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1513293 my ball club is going through a pretty tough time right now and i got to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
1513294 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1513295 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1513296 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1513297 if people know olivo thats the way he is im not saying hes wrong or right i managed him and know the way he is if olivo thought it was a purpose pitch he made the right decision
1513298 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1513299 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1513300 he didnt really try to fight olivo really or anyone
1513301 he basically is not in the right mind set to play here because of all the things that went on
1513302 the football team has moved forward the train has left the station he needs to jump on the train or if we cant get past all the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving he respects that he understands that
1513303 mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1513304 when we entered that apartment on the night that katelynns body was found my information was that she was sleeping on the floor in one of the bedrooms
1513305 it is probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing the worst
1513306 had i known i would have never in my entire life left her
1513307 this is a horrific case and there should be a lot of public interest in it
1513308 the federal government has apologized to the chinese first nations and japanese community in parliament
1513309 this is not fair to the whole indo canadian community
1513310 beginning with the chinese immigration act of 1885 a head tax of 50 was imposed on chinese newcomers in an attempt to deter immigration for over six decades these race based financial measures aimed solely at the chinese were implemented with deliberation by the canadian state this was a grave injustice and one we are morally obligated to acknowledge therefore mr speaker on behalf of all canadians and the government of canada we offer a full apology to chinese canadians for the head tax and express our deepest sorrow for the subsequent exclusion of chinese immigrants
1513311 nearly half a century ago in the crisis of wartime the government of canada wrongfully incarcerated seized the property and disenfranchised thousands of citizens of japanese ancestry
1513312 we cannot change the past but we must as a nation have the courage to face up to these historical facts
1513313 i know i speak for members of all sides of the house in offering to japanese canadians the formal and sincere apology of this parliament for those past injustices against them their families and their heritage and our solemn commitment to canadians of every origin that they will never again be countenanced or repeated
1513314 those who governed in london at the time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy
1513315 i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice it serves no one for the wrong people to be convicted for such an awful crime
1513316 we come here today partly in recognition of the fact that we in the united states and the world community did not do as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit what occurred
1513317 allowing us all to feel good about ourselves for berating policies in which we played no part
1513318 indigenous land taken illegally from devastated indigenous communities over the last 150 years
1513319 well its time we gave the land back to the people as the colonial regimes where made to do in africa
1513320 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
1513321 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
1513322 i was trained at drama school and when i got into films i stayed there for longer than i planned
1513323 but when i made my theatrical debut at the age of 50 i knew i wanted to do more
1513324 it was one of the most enjoyable things ive done
1513325 but it did nothing for my career because people thought it was all i could do
1513326 not the kind youre thinking i married very young peter had a major heart attack not long afterwards and we lived a quiet life in the country so i think the sixties youre talking about rather passed me by
1513327 ah well yes we lived a life that would be shocking today the excess the jetsetting the polluting lifestyle i see life differently now
1513328 oh no it has been a very interesting process and in no way am i upset
1513329 i saw pictures of myself at 20 and even i was stunned i looked young and blonde and i can quite see how peter would fall for me
1513330 no i think regretting things creates bitterness and i am not a bitter person i think you learn from things and move on anyone who knows me will know my philosophy is get on with it
1513331 people keep telling me that i am this that or the other and i think what do they mean much of what has been written doesnt feel like it was me
1513332 i love being on stage i love the attention and the fact that people are focused on me
1513333 a gentle stroll through my life just me talking about the way it was
1513334 my show comes down at 7 30pm so thats a little early to start socialising
1513335 reviewers seem to think its about the crisis of british youth
1513336 they are trying to do their best for their children but as a tutor i came to realise how the crisis of youth does not just affect the largely underprivileged victims of knife and gun crime but also children in the higher strata of society
1513337 i thought i would be compensating for the shortcomings of the state system but my clients lived in the swankiest parts of west london and attended the most amazing schools
1513338 they were putting in bankers hours at the age of 11 their parents were so hyped about them getting into the right school where they would meet the right people go to the right university and maintain their class privilege that they didnt want to leave anything to chance
1513339 they feel powerful playing those games because in real life they feel powerless one 12 year old girl i taught was an advanced wizard in the world of warcraft game who would trounce adults in magic battles
1513340 when i was a child i retreated into fantasy worlds through books which give you a wider range of experiences i also played world war ii games but i would be dressed up in camouflage and out in the garden with my friends while these children are indoors alone staring at a screen
1513341 penshurst is a pretty village but an awful place to grow up
1513342 nothing happened you couldnt go anywhere as there was no public transport and there was no sense of community because everyone was either retired or commuted into london i found school violent idiotic and everyone was stupid i hated games and discipline
1513343 i can see the contempt in your eyes for what we do
1513344 it was true and im grateful because i realised then that i belonged in literature and started a phd
1513345 you can pass gcse english without ever having read a complete book and at a level you can study a populist poet such as carol ann duffy rather than t s eliot there is a sense that we cant make things too difficult in case kids fail but that is part of education
1513346 it is quite possible for undergraduates only to be taught by phd students because the full time staff are busy putting out gratuitous publications in order to get more funding
1513347 with you and me i wasnt sure was i less were you more
1513348 it doesnt matter with what as long as your shooting
1513349 if you think the whole world has been explored think again
1513350 i spend my life trying to block out peoples need
1513351 there are police officers who wouldnt come near these kids
1513352 black tea a caffeine containing beverage showed an inverse association with parkinsons disease risk that was not confounded by total caffeine intake or tobacco smoking this suggests that ingredients of black tea other than caffeine appear to be responsible for the beverages inverse association with parkinsons disease
1513353 thanks for coming to see sweet tiny show because your support is so important i just want to make sure that you all got the flier about sweet tinier show opening soon come on out and support the arts
1513354 i guess as an army wife i have to prepare for anything
1513355 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1513356 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1513357 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1513358 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1513359 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1513360 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1513361 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1513362 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1513363 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1513364 its a frustrating process for any athlete whos ever gone through it to be at the top of the game moving around and all of a sudden going to the bathroom is one of the hardest things to do
1513365 its been a struggle its also been a great learning experience
1513366 the last three holes i knew i had a two shot lead
1513367 i didnt step on my big toe and make any bogeys i parred the last three nothing heroic
1513368 they talk about all the camaraderie that the europeans have
1513369 i dont know about all this camaraderie stuff sure it helps but the fact is our guys just need to play better
1513370 i had him over for dinner in ireland about six weeks ago
1513371 the first question i asked him was it a blind par 3 at home when you have a blind par 3 often the caddies stick the golf balls in the hole so ive been teasing him about that
1513372 vidro 33 batted 234 in 85 games this season he made 8 5 million this season of which his last team the washington n ationals paid 2 5 million he has a vesting option for 2009 that activates at 600 plate appearances which he will not reach triggering a 500 000 buyout
1513373 it is something ive got to deal with it the rest of the season im going to have good days and bad days some days it feels right sometimes it didnt
1513374 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1513375 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1513376 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1513377 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1513378 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go
1513379 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1513380 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1513381 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1513382 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1513383 talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses

1513425 specifically for those who were expecting to see nintendo show something about super mario or legend of zelda however the fact of the matter is the so called big titles need a long long development period we really didnt think this years e3 media briefing was the time to do so
1513426 i think one of the things that these lack is if you stuck every one of these re done shots right next to each other you would not be able to tell that they re in different areas
1513427 this is going to be one of those things that i say something in an interview and it gets fed back to him and im on his s head list for a while on that until he needs me to do something else there but i think that thats my general opinion
1513428 that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1513429 call of duty and bioshock could be banned under that criteria the next game to be banned could be bioshock 2 and then where would we be
1513430 bioshock had no multi player mode we dont believe in throwing in something that can t go head to head with the big boys no applicants will be considered who arent able to demonstrate theyve got the skills to build an industry changing multiplayer design

1513442 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1513443 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1513444 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate

1513448 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1513449 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book

1513451 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1513452 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1513453 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1513454 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1513455 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1513456 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1513457 it is something ive got to deal with it the rest of the season im going to have good days and bad days some days it feels right sometimes it didnt
1513458 you just dont walk out there and be in midseason form
1513459 i dont think i was very sharp by any means but i would have gotten some outs today
1513460 i need to mechanically get a lot better but my arm feels good and my finger feels great i didnt have a second thought about it
1513461 if i feel good i think the results will be there
1513462 theres very few times you feel great and you dont do well
1513463 the positive was the last slider i threw was the best one i threw
1513464 theres times you go out there and you just dont have it right away and you just find a way to get outs until you get comfortable
1513465 i dont know what they have done but this certainly isnt bernard malamuds
1513466 we are in a very problematic situation today especially the israeli embassy abroad because of the threats that we got from the terrorist organisation hezbollah to strike israeli embassies in west africa though they did not speak about a specific country but there is intelligence and information that speak about this possibility attack on israeli interests in nigeria
1513467 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1513468 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1513469 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1513470 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1513471 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes

1513473 most hpv infections are cleared spontaneously recent research using available molecular detection technologies suggests that clearance occurs within one year for about 70 per cent of those infected and within two years for 90 per cent thus hpv infection and cervical cancer must not be conflated most women who are infected with even a high risk strain of hpv will not develop cervical cancer
1513474 there are twice as many children collapsing and four times as many children experiencing tingling numbness and loss of sensation after getting gardasil vaccination compared to those getting a tdap tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccination
1513475 there have been reports of facial paralysis and guillain barre syndrome and doctors who give gardasil in combination with other vaccines are basically conducting an experiment on their young patients because merck has not published any safety data for simultaneous vaccination with any vaccine except hepatitis b vaccine

1513493 they have their own capability to inflict damage to make sure that the roads and the passages stay open and they get to where they want to go whether its through pakistan iran up through russia and all the known trade routes so this is a very violent cartel
1513494 they are buying their protection by funding other organizations from criminal gangs to tribes to inciting any kind of resistance to keep the government off of their back
1513495 right now the issue is stability going in there in itself and attacking the drug trade actually feeds the instability that you want to overcome
1513496 attacking the problem directly in terms of the drug trade would undermine the attempt to gain popular support in the region
1513497 work closely with sponsors in top government and political positions
1513498 payments to police to avoid eradication or arrest reportedly are very widespread at higher levels provincial and district police chief appointments appear to be a tool for key traffickers and sponsors to exercise control and favor their proteges at middle levels in the drug industry

1513542 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
1513543 it cannot be proved that there is any health advantage to drinking red wine for example rather than beer
1513544 studies indicate that light to moderate alcohol consumption from beer wine or spirits is associated with a reduction in all cause mortality owing primarily to a decreased risk of coronary heart disease
1513545 moderate beer consumption may help to maintain the total homocysteine levels in the normal range due to high folate content folate from beer may contribute to the protective effect of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease in population s with generally low folate intake from other nutrients
1513546 overall we found that non drinkers have the most strokes and white matter disease light to moderate drinkers have fewer strokes and the least amount of white matter disease but somewhat greater atrophy moderately heavy drinkers had the fewest strokes but more white matter disease and the most atrophy
1513547 light to moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke
1513548 the gene is basically distributed at random with respect to behavioral characteristics including alcohol consumption so you cant argue that people with this gene exercise more or have a better diet
1513549 the majority of more recent large population based studies have observed that moderate drinking in the range of one to three drinks daily is associated with a 30 40 percent lower rate of coronary heart disease compared to non drinking
1513550 the epidemiologic data suggest that increasing consumption above one or two drinks per day is detrimental and not protective
1513551 higher intakes of alcohol appear to increase triacylglycerides and do not appear to improve cholesterol levels
1513552 pub time allows men to bond with friends and colleagues
1513553 men need break out time as much as women and are mentally healthier for it
1513554 the results showed that people who drank alcohol including beer and spirits were less likely to report ill health than people who abstained altogether
1513555 overall the higher the consumption of total alcohol the lower the levels of subjective ill health
1513556 oh how i wish i would have worked an extra 20 hours each week

1513600 you talk about championships the wait then the repeat but holding that trophy there is a magnificent picture of you holding that trophy what goes through your mind is there a lot of history involved in that
1513601 especially the first one alot of history because there were a lot of broken hearts in our fans and what they dealt with over the years and the longer you are there as a player the more you understood what that burden had been on red sox nation to finally do that and overcome that hurdle it just changed the whole dynamic of the organization
1513602 i take pride in it it was a little tough for me in the beginning to wear it but the organization felt that was something they wanted to do so i went with it but its just i am just more honored to have that opportunity because thats the kind of player i want to be
1513603 you dont see that much anymore derek jeter and a few un appointed captains but does that change who you are do the guys see you differently in the clubhouse
1513604 some that dont know that dont know me maybe it hasnt changed my role or who i am it just gave a symbol or an extra letter on my jersey to give them an official title so to speak
1513605 okay so you have so many innings under you a lot of them how many more do you think are under jason variteks legs knowing that free agency is close do you want to return to the red sox
1513606 given where you are right now how much longer would you like to catch
1513607 health as long as my body is healthy and i can competitively move and do things back there to help a team win i dont know how long that will be but i know i am still able to handle the day games after night games on a consistent basis so ive got a few left in me
1513608 i have so many of those games under my belt and its an exciting time for baseball it builds on the history and it builds on the fan involvement the fan involvement stirs more media involvement more hype and stirs the whole thing and its something great for baseball
1513609 do you have a particular game that you remember the most on the offensive side or defensive side that you can share
1513610 the one that i mean i dont even know what i did offensively but finally winning that game 7 of the alcs
1513611 what can you share with us about that place they call fenway park
1513612 same thing our fans its a historic stadium its huge its old but changing all the time but the same core thing is there a very knowledgable passionate fan base
1513613 our fan base is the strongest in major league baseball our fan base has changed a little bit smiles from not ever winning a championship and having their hearts broken to being ecstatic about being a red sox fan
1513614 johnny was just such a he was not only a gamer but he was such a unique personality weve had a few of em over the years but he was a guy that would play hurt play with a broken leg if he had to but yet he had such a flamboyant personality with the media with the fans its a good combination of both
1513615 you know manny says that he has some things that you tell him sometimes that really pick him up you dont need to share those with us but do you realize the impact you have had on him
1513616 uh especially this year because manny has opened up a bit more he has knowledge especially about hitting and i have seen him grow and not only has he always been that great hitter but hes grown in that outfield and has learned how to play that wall better than any player i have ever seen on this team i appreciate that in reference to the impact i dont think i ever knew that about manny
1513617 lucky every one of them was so different and how they happened the uniqueness of them a lot of things had to go into play probably two of the best overall pitchers ive ever caught we didnt have one thats pedro and curt and i would also throw josh into that category so many things have to go right and every one of them just got dominate late in the game
1513618 is there anything early in any of those from hideos to derek lowes to lester to buchholz that told you that there is something special going on in the game or no
1513619 uh probably more so with buchholz than any of them after three or four innings lesters he struggled early it was a tough field that day it was windy cool the balls were drying he couldnt even grip the ball he was coming to us panicking because he had no feel to the ball and then things just happened he got some ground ball outs the sun went down and the wind went away and he just dominated nomo didnt have a great spring and it was his first outing of the season and he just became so powerful between his fastball and his split throughout that game and he threw predominately fast balls late in the game and threw just a heavy ball and then the abberation derek lowes just a lot of things went right
1513620 your catching skills are unparalled from your peers to coaches and managers but handling young pitchers like a buchholz is it different than in the way you handle a schilling a beckett a pedro martinez
1513621 there is a difference i am learning the younger guys and what to do like where you want to go with them to add confidence and then add stuff to make them more complete but not throw everything at them all at once i am learning that as i go along to because over the last two years weve had more development than we did my first 7 8 years
1513622 so here i am i am a young pitcher tie situation youve done your charts youve studied your everything but i think i have great stuff coming out of the bullpen and my fastball is electric but you dont see that whats the best way for you to communicate that to me
1513623 i still believe it doesnt have to be electric it just has to be executed well try and slow down the game a little bit and let you go just pitch to pitch literally
1513624 get down here with your camera they are going all out to put this fire down quickly

1513634 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavors
1513635 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1513636 pasteurizing and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavors
1513637 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1513638 golden brown session beer full bodied with an aroma of floral hops initial malty flavor fades as citrus and hops take over leading to a hoppy bitter finish
1513639 its one of the hardest beers to brew because there are fewer ingredients in it and weve managed to put a lot of flavor into a low alcohol beer and keep it consistent
1513640 the water that comes from the local north downs hills is perfect for brewing bitters
1513641 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1513642 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1513643 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1513644 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1513645 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1513662 we are not just guessing we have seen the proof in the fields
1513663 we have to look at the situation with careful optimism
1513664 we do not think by any stretch of the imagination that poppy cultivation in afghanistan has been eliminated but we like the rest of the world welcome positive news
1513665 it is amazing really when you see the fields that last year were filled with poppies and this year there is wheat
1513666 last year i was able to buy meat and wheat and now this year there is nothing
1513667 the taliban were patrolling all the time of course i was afraid i did not want to go to jail and lose my freedom and my dignity
1513668 this year was the most important for us because growing poppies was part of their culture and the first years are always the most difficult
1513669 it is our decree that there will be no poppy cultivation it is banned forever in this country
1513670 whether we get assistance or not poppy growing will never be allowed again in our country
1513671 ive learned never to regret anything because at one point in time it made you happy

1513682 a true story of date rape the katie koestner story
1513683 we were not dating we were not hooking up we were hanging out
1513684 they spent day after day with each other and koestner developed a full blown crush on peter
1513685 the first on the long list of girls who wanted to date him peter
1513686 youre going to have to have sex with me whenever i want to
1513687 different people think the most extraordinary different things when you invite them over
1513688 it was clear to katie that she was trapped underneath someone who was more than 60 pounds heavier than she was
1513689 her arms were held above her head by only one of his arms he kissed her aggressively and she could barely speak
1513690 i am sorry i promise you it will never happen again
1513691 a few minutes later peter got on top of her raped her and left the room saying he would see her at breakfast
1513692 stresses three factors that can prevent date rape the first is responsibility with alcohol and drugs as they are involved in 90 of rapes the second and third are communication and respect
1513693 sex without consent is rape and silence does not mean no

1513705 they pmc employees basically had a license to kill because they had no ucmj to follow like us whereas if i shot a single round from my weapon i would get asked a hundred question to why i opened fire

1513714 it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along into war
1513715 voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifist for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger
1513716 the art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses

1513761 i went to west springfield high school and graduated the same year as anne andy sulick was a friend of mine he was a great guy and he had a sheepish look whether he was wearing a stetson hat or not west springfield was a upper white middle class suburb of washington dc many of the fathers commuted into washington dc where they worked there were many military and government families and springfield had more than its fair share of colonels including my father as a commuter town springfield lacked a soul in effect it was created to house commuters it had not evolved as a town from historical beginnings social life for high school kids focused on the fast food shops and other local convenient stores such as burger chef and peoples drug pharmacy store it was surrounded by a relatively poor virginia backwater which time had left behind mainly wooded countryside with winding country roads and it was there that the kids could go to escape the supervision and morals of their parents such as on graduation night the children of these upper middle class families felt immune from the tragedies of the vietnam and nicaraguan wars going on at the time spoiled without having to work hard for their money for the class of 71 the vietnam war and the draft was ending in the nick of time to save most of them from having to fight there and although they represented the conservative christian majority the communities had little exposure to minorities such as refugees from the wars and possibly some of them preferred it that way

1513935 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1513936 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1513937 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1513938 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1513939 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
1513940 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
1513941 i dont remember anyone talking about knowing they were being videotaped in those meetings but if you have the khadr videotape and this statement that seems pretty clear the question is did the u s destroy everything
1513942 interrogators from recognized human rights abusing regimes onto the u s military base
1513943 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist and that contrary to what the military says it was absolutely sop
1513944 i would be shocked if they had not been destroyed
1513945 i think theres no question if you invite someone in and they threaten them the person who invited them in should be held accountable
1513946 we will request any and all videotapes by u s and foreign intelligence services to find out what was being done to them and what threats were made against them

1513971 for whatever reason that hasnt eventuated and we cant see that improving theres certainly no assurances it will improve
1513972 if we cant come to some sort of arrangement where weve got a permanent training base for next season well have to take a closer look at the options available to us
1513973 whether that includes gosford belmore or the crest at bass hill remains to be seen
1513974 i think all sydney based clubs need to look at the merits of relocating to gosford

1513988 the government argues that even if the minimal fourth amendment standard of reasonable suspicion applies to such searches its search of arnolds laptop comported with that standard
1513989 that the border search of information stored in a computer hard drive is not subject to fourth amendment protection
1513990 even if one grants the legitimacy of customs searches for contraband how can the government claim the right to extend such a search beyond the physical
1513991 given the existence of such a law it is only a question of time before a government employee trying to do his job decides to use whatever legal means he can
1513992 youre being laid off at work the test came back youve got cancer youre sorry hes dead its a fallen world and therefore we will all suffer so we must prepare because the ideal time to be educated about suffering is never in the midst of it we need to be trained prior to suffering so that we may be fully sustained in suffering

1513997 whenever ive searched for the origins of rhythm in my life the only thing ive ever been able to find is the rhythm of the litanies in the latin mass the ora pro nobis iteration in funeral services and the antiphonal ceremony of rogations in the fields
1513998 if the sentence is cloddish and clunky its simply wrong and not just wrong sounding but wrong in its meaning
1513999 when i come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences im sure im floundering in the false by searching i find the proper expression which was always the only one and which is also harmonious the word is never lacking when one possesses the idea is there not in this precise fitting of parts something eternal like a principal if not why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry

1514007 im not going to sit here and talk rubbish to you of course it was discussed
1514008 at the end of our playing campaign the three boys careers will be assessed again
1514009 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the season but were not sitting down as a club right at the moment going who are we going to trade we dont do that until the end of the year
1514010 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own team mates in the eye and actually lying to them that really destroys the essence of the club
1514011 it was decided by the leadership group and the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper
1514012 we feel that the integrity of this football club and that the policies of honesty and integrity that we build the whole organisation on if thats robbed or taken away or diminished in any way shape or form then youre striking at the very essence or core of your existence you might as well turn the lights off and go home

1514016 if an agent who was accredited by us encouraged and promoted a player to breach his contract and go overseas in similar circumstances to sonny bill wed probably go close to disbarring him and revoking his licence
1514017 it would be in breach of our code of conduct which requires all players to adhere to their side of the contract
1514018 we also had a university of nsw contract law expert deborah healey in who said facilitating a player breaching their contract that they too could be liable
1514019 the only way it could happen is if a private club owner over there thumbed his nose at the irb and the ffr

1514029 the three universities have identified the repairs that are critical for the health and safety of the students faculty and employees
1514030 i have read that asu plans to use its funds to address all of its identified fire life safety issues shockingly the u of a and nau plan to address only some of their critically needed repairs
1514031 any life safety issues will be dealt with forthwith and there will be no students threatened in any way because of a lack at any of the three universities taking care of their deferred maintenance
1514032 that means ua isnt fixing 17 million of life safety issues
1514033 the speaker is saying we just gave you a billion dollars the universities have identified 328 million worth of fire and life safety issues why is that not a first priority
1514034 examined all deferred maintenance needs and education needs and there will be no fire and life safety issues that wont be addressed

1514043 a priest also when he celebrates the eucharist must serve god and the people with dignity and humility and by his bearing and by the way he says the divine words he must convey to the faithful the living presence of christ
1514044 this sacrifice then as the passion of christ itself even though it is offered for everyone has no effect if not in those who unite thmesleves to the passion of christ through faith and charity
1514045 may the lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his holy church
1514046 devoutly and faithfully the mysteries of christ for the praise of god and the sanctification of the christian people according to the tradition of the church
1514047 the mystery of the eucharist is too great for anyone to permit himself to treat it according to his own whim so that its sacredness and its universal ordering would be obscured
1514048 the ars celebrandi is the fruit of faithful adherence to the liturgical norms in all their richness indeed for two thousand years this way of celebrating has sustained the faith life of all believers
1514049 an authentic liturgical action expresses the sacredness of the eucharistic mystery this should be evident from the words and actions of the priest who celebrates as he intercedes to god the father both with the faithful and on their behalf
1514050 the ars celebrandi must foster a sense of the sacred and the use of outward signs which help to cultivate this sense such as for example the harmony of the rite the liturgical vestments the furnishings and the sacred place

1514061 russias initial aim was to retaliate over kosovo claiming independence and to stop georgia joining nato and when the west showed its incapacity to act russia saw the possibility finally to annex these territories and redraw the borders of eastern europe
1514062 but we wouldnt be alone it would be a war of the caucasian peoples against georgia and russia would be obliged to protect its citizens
1514063 at a local level georgians and south ossetians can get on and want to live their lives in peace
1514064 but as regards the military situation if tension continues to rise then there is the potential for a deterioration into some form of armed conflict

1514079 if spirit has any meaning it must be omnipresent or all pervading and
1514080 furthermore it is not that spirit is present but you need to be
1514081 further if spirit has any meaning at all then it must be eternal or
1514082 rather spirit and enlightenment has to be something that you are fully aware of right now something you are already looking at right now we are all already looking directly at spirit we just dont recognize it we have all the necessary cognition but not the recognition

1514104 kde 4 1 is a significant release for the project because 4 0 was controversial for some with its architectural breaks and some quality issues

1514155 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1514156 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1514157 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1514253 one of the points that should be clear here today is that the obama campaign does a wonderful job of presenting their candidate in the most popular light that they can get and i think they do a very good job at it
1514254 they have more fans around the world than britney spears does i make that bold blatant statement
1514255 what we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world and i would say from our estimations britney and paris came in second and third
1514256 so from our perspective we have in this ad the three biggest celebrities in the world
1514257 i think thats what weve been saying all along apples to apples

1514274 she said a case of rum shipped from her country to the permanent mission of cuba for use in official protocol and diplomatic functions had been denied entry the first such denial of an official transaction it was an example of the host countrys new policy to deny diplomatic rights to some countries in violation of international agreements which did not allow interference in the work of diplomatic missions the host country should reconsider its position with the greatest urgency regardless of its bilateral stance with regard to cuba it must ensure that cuba was able to carry out its important role in the united nations in response the representative of the united states said customs clearance issues were the responsibility of the united states office of foreign missions conversations with that office had revealed a particular problem with the shipment in question cuba had been offered the option of re exporting the shipment rather than have it become subject to the seizure that would be the normal course in other similar situations cubas representative said she had spoken with that office but the shipment had not been released re export was not an option since the shipment was an essential requirement for the conduct of official functions the upcoming general assembly session would present occasions for receptions that could not be carried out without receipt of the shipment the representative of the united states said his mission would meet with the cuban mission for further discussion of the legal aspects of the situation

1514280 in fact i would call for an early clarification of anything that comes after the word kiwi
1514281 we dont want to see kiwisaver undermined and we want the incentives through the employer tax credit
1514282 kiwisaver as it currently works means one employee is paid more if they are in kiwisaver which leads to endless disputation and difficulty
1514283 no matter what partys in power whether the labour party admits this or not that employer side of the coin is just not going to work under the present policy prescription and never will its fundamentally broken

1514287 aerial inspections are perfect for patrolling and inspecting overhead powerlines because they are fast and effective and are not dependent on ground conditions or powerline access
1514288 taking to the sky allows country energy to systematically access the electricity network and easily pinpoint potential weaknesses including faults areas where the network has suffered damage from storms or where there is vegetation overhanging powerlines
1514289 once identified we are then able to send in a country energy crew directly to the site to address these problems
1514290 the aircraft are fitted with special high resolution digital cameras gps equipment and computers which improve visibility allowing our team to get a better snapshot of the electricity network
1514291 our annual inspection program is an integral part of country energys aim to identify and repair potential hazards before they affect supply and inconvenience customers
1514292 im a sceptic in the sense of the speed of the actions proposed by the government which are at best a staggering over response to a populist issue im just sick of the doomsday people who say that if we dont act tomorrow we will be dead by next week
1514293 but even science can get things wrong sometimes all the people i dealt with in that role that were convinced about the extent of mans contribution to climate change are probably a little too convinced
1514294 but saying that i dont blame the scientists because theyve had their information picked up by people who have blown the issue out of context because they see this as their political lifeline
1514295 i have a great respect for the instincts of people who live in the elements and i dont see any old bushmen or farmers panicking just yet

1514342 there is no real contradiction the members of jacobs family numbered seventy but the whole family would include the wives of jacobs sons
1514343 the hebrew text of exodus 1 5 states seventy but the septuagint which acts 7 basically follows and the fragments of exodus found among the dead sea scrolls read seventy five the explanation of the number seventy five is to be found in the five additional descendants of joseph included in the greek translation of gen 46 20 which lists two sons of manasseh two sons of ephraim and one grandson of ephraim
1514344 such variations occasionally occur in the greek old testament and we dont always have the information necessary to explain them
1514345 perhaps an inadvertent scribal addition this name is omitted in num 26 12 and 1 chr 4 24

1514373 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1514374 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1514375 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1514376 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1514377 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1514378 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies

1514385 ive learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he she handles these three things a rainy day lost luggage and tangled christmas tree lights
1514386 ive learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents youll miss them when theyre gone from your life
1514387 ive learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance
1514388 ive learned that you shouldnt go through life with a catchers mitt on both hands you need to be able to throw some things back
1514389 ive learned that whenever i decide something with an open heart i usually make the right decision
1514390 ive learned that even when i have pains i dont have to be one
1514391 ive learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone people love a warm hug or just a friendly pat on the back
1514392 ive learned that i still have a lot to learn
1514393 why god is waiting to obliterate all evil in the world
1514394 how is god listening to every single person in the world any less ridiculous than santa clause visiting every house in one night
1514395 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1514396 passing the new glow wire ignition test is very challenging for conventional thermoplastics because many self ignite around the test temperature
1514397 by drawing on the legacy of sabic innovative plastics exceptional technical expertise we have been able to engineer nearly a dozen grades that meet this tough safety standard by choosing from our portfolio appliance manufacturers will have one less hurdle to overcome in getting their products to market
1514398 they would rather keep their young people despite our contract
1514399 its past practice they are trying to prevent us from bumping because we are older and a lot of us are women
1514400 usually an arbitration takes you a year and a half before you have a date
1514401 i dont see anyone waiting that long for a job
1514402 we made an offer to the union and it was rejected i guess they are going to take it to an arbitration and let them sort it out
1514403 a lot of women work and have kids and family and dont schedule annual exams because theyre too busy
1514404 here they can have all their tests done in one day
1514405 its a lot easier to schedule everything in one day i can get everything done in one trip
1514406 women who have their pap and mammography exams are more likely to take advantage of preventative health measures improve their diet quit smoking
1514407 weve got people looking for land so they can plant alfalfa or almonds
1514408 one of the races was at a temporary street course in the middle of a city and an edit bay was set up in a canopy environment it had one side open for direct visibility of the racetrack one day during race preparations it rained soaking the ground i remember kneeling on empty betacam tape cases while setting up the equipment just to keep dry
1514409 the worst location was in a couple of trailers salvaged from a construction site located next to a soundstage warehouse
1514410 there seems to be an unwritten rule about the field editors dont like windows and feel uncomfortable if it isnt stuffy or the air conditioner doesnt blow down the back of their neck the corollary is the smaller the room the better it takes a lot of persuasion to get enough space for a couple of tape shelves let alone seating for producers and directors during the final tweak stages
1514411 current nle systems arent as fussy about their environment as past models but many producers and production managers still dont allow a margin of error when picking a spot for editors to work
1514412 my biggest complaint is the chair its tough editing for eighteen hours in a folding chair i really miss my leather couch and comfortable chair you dont always have the best setup but thats the way it is with mobile work and how you deal with it separates the men from the boys on the road
1514413 since the crew is traveling theres no option of having two editors so i usually work both shifts
1514414 in a facility there seems to be greater awareness that the clock is ticking and each minute is adding to the bill if you are cutting in a clients office space on their system your invoice is the only charge that changes when more hours of work are needed
1514415 we landed at miami international at 6 05pm and found a quiet part of the charter area at mia i cued bremen when to speak and he laid down his new higher quality track onto channel one in the audio dub mode while cueing himself with playback on the pearlcorder to keep the timing accurate
1514416 i started using final cut pro just to rough out shows before finishing on an avid symphony as the workload grew i started finishing on the fcp system i still like the symphony but i can do the same work on the lower cost system although it takes longer and final cut pro is much more portable i have a friend that edits on a laptop and that is quickly becoming a more common sight with all the advantages it offers to the location editor
1514417 es duro es doloroso no ser amado cuando se ama todav a pero es bastante m s duro ser todav a amado cuando ya no se ama
1514418 we are designers so we always prefer to be involved in the design process as early as possible
1514419 modern nle audio and graphics suites do not suffer the problems that were incurred in the old days power requirements cooling physical space etc are no longer the great concern as when conventional machine rooms were required to house multiple one inch vtrs and racks of video electronics today in smaller installations without a central machine room housing racks of equipment for multiple suites everything runs on simple desktop computers that use conventional office power and existing building hvac the best types of installations are like the world class facilities that john has built my clients want to have the same performance but spend less money to accomplish the same end result although i have been fortunate to build some beautiful facilities i have also had to build facilities where the machine room had no air conditioning and operated at 90 degrees fahrenheit the client finally took my advice to spend the money on proper air conditioning when the equipment started to fail due to overheating
1514420 get a great chair you cant beat that try not to have furniture any higher than thirty six inches this will acoustically block the speakers
1514421 the good news is that surface applied acoustic products such as pre fab diffusors and acoustic absorption have become increasingly available over the past five years and more good news have gone down in price more interestingly progress has been made in relatively thin and inexpensive low frequency treatments
1514422 i believe god is going to visit you in your dreams
1514423 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees then went walking on the beach and after that we slow danced wait it gets better
1514424 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1514425 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1514426 i believe in you jesus and i accept your perfect record for my imperfect record
1514427 not guilty you are declared innocent an upright and perfect law abiding citizen you are free to go you have never ever done anything wrong in your whole life youve always kept the law perfectly
1514428 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is near repent and believe the gospel
1514429 the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart
1514430 everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame
1514431 how timely is the arrival 17 of those who proclaim the good news
1514432 this man who was handed over by the pre determined plan and foreknowledge of god you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of gentiles
1514433 i carry you in my bossom and nurture you you are the apple of my eyes even though when you walk through the waters you will not drown and when you walk through the fire you will not burn im the river of living water and i love you with an everlasting love
1514434 when there are relatively simple changes like a few words that are different its not too bad and scriptsync is smart enough to skip over these and catch up to the right point in the dialogue however its tougher when whole lines of dialogue are different then my assistant has to sync these areas by hand again
1514435 restarts are the biggest problem avid is working on ways to tell the software to ignore certain areas but for the time being these issues have to be fixed by hand depending on the production these fixes offset the gains offered by scriptsyncs automation so you might not end up saving as much time as youd hoped
1514436 ive really come to rely on this feature and would have to change my whole workflow if i were editing with another system
1514437 theres less to worry about and its easier to be your own assistant
1514438 i was familiar with the old manual way prior to scriptsync and found it to be very time consuming but i tried it on a few short projects and liked it i have the luxury of an assistant editor on
1514439 it just gets to be too much data for the system to handle efficiently if you try to work in a single master script bin with all the clips tied to the film script instead import the script into several bins and then just work with one to five scenes in each bin
1514440 it makes you look smarter the session just goes more smoothly when youre in the room with the director and every take is at your fingertips
1514441 if you dont have an assistant youd really have to weigh the advantages against the schedule you spend more time on the front end but you really make it up on the back end its a real time saver when people are in the room i just love the feature of highlighting a section of dialogue and quickly being able to see and hear every bit of coverage for that line
1514442 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1514443 sleep for whenever i want for however long i want

1514460 have no doubt that the sole purpose of this site was to produce a statistic the home office can use to totally bend the truth and tell us we the student population are broadly in favour of something in actuality a huge number are completely opposed

1514462 those who miss gaza operations neednt worry they will come

1514470 leona is really excited im sure her bank manager or should that be simon cowell is too it will make her an absolute packet
1514471 you recall when drana the philosopher decreed far and wide that if she could find one man or woman with proof of the gods with absolute proof that she would forever lay down her ways and convert become a cleric or somesuch
1514472 you know very well i have studied the dranist texts all of my life it was called the calling and no one who came to court provided any insight into the mind of the gods other than garden variety magic superstition and parlor tricks
1514473 that the shaman among the soderon thought long and hard about whom to send to queensland to prove the queen and drana the philosopher wrong they were prepared to send their greatest shaman a woman by the name of mesan to queensland when a vision was granted to their shamans a vision of a future there they saw the shores of queensland dry and empty of fish and the deserts of soderon teeming with life
1514474 mesan did not go visit drana the philosopher she convinced the king of the time alsanir that if she were to do so the vision of the future a future victory for the soderons would be lost
1514475 i know your opinion of the soderons is lacking to say the least but they are a deeply religious people who believe their long suffering difficulty in siring females has come to an end through some ritual i could not understand for the life of me
1514476 the uniformity of nature is a crucial metaphysical issue which provides a world system in which we can practically live out our lives as well as engage in scientific research the
1514477 an illustration for the uniformity of nature and objections raised i hope that has helped your friends
1514478 but since it happened in the past and therefore very probable it is going to be that way in the future
1514479 fine if what you say is true then i no longer believe in the uniformity if nature
1514480 let him be exposed of his actions speak louder than words fallacy

1514484 criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the global to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe
1514485 obviously we werent happy that someone we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1514486 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1514487 rather than locking every single door lets get all the safes
1514488 not that we dont want to lock the doors but if that worked then we wouldnt be in this mess

1514492 the market is clearly in transition and we will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spending and to aggressively move into market adjacencies
1514493 i had dinner once with richard clark at the table and i said is there an equivalent to the patriot act an ipatriot act just sitting waiting for some substantial event just waiting for them to come have the excuse for radically changing the way the internet works
1514494 we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowestin the nations of eastern and southern africa
1514495 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 per cent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development
1514496 he was everything i despised great student got along with teachers didnt smoke cigarettes or smoke pot
1514497 im not going to be in a band with this guy theres no way on earth
1514498 we just wanted something that was short and concise and wouldnt typecast us as any particular type of group
1514499 all the bands early advertising posters used eyes as their central motif
1514500 throughout the 70s college radio was a bit of a joke often being left field and obscure for the sake of it with jazz being particularly dominant

1514503 for those at the back of the hall michael was a near silhouette at the microphone bill practically indiscernible behind his drum kit and mike and peter reduced to vague shapes moving around in the onstage murk 2
1514504 they sell images and were not a band that takes to the selling of images
1514505 mike mills rumbling bass and bill berrys often sharp slashing drums cast a cloudy post punk aura that is lightened by peter bucks folk flavored guitar playing
1514506 slip the dance rhythm into the background slow up the tempo and push up the melody and vocals
1514507 fables was as essential as r e m s first two albums in creating an alternative to the mainstream airwaves and establishing a benchmark of quality for the american underground
1514508 what we want and what we need have been confused
1514509 its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine
1514510 reveal will be one of the three or four that theyll pick out of our work and say oh yeah thats what the group were about
1514511 its sporadic pockets of accessibility aside its difficult to listen to around the sun without hearing it as a holding pattern or worse a piece of product released simply to keep the r e m brand out among the public
1514512 the albums chief problem is that every word every note and every instrument sounds dry sapped of most of their personality
1514513 one of the best records r e m have ever made
1514514 cans of piss and a gangster act the birth of r e m
1514515 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1514516 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1514517 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1514518 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1514519 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1514520 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1514521 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1514522 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1514523 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1514524 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1514525 meeting people on this trip id come to see was not difficult but developing a real relationship even a temporary one was far different from being shielded by a reporters notebook
1514526 is the only world religion that is evangelical in the sense of sharing good news with others islam converts by force buddhism without the benfit of theoloy and hinduism doesnt even try
1514527 jesus wants us to see that the neighbor next door or the people sitting next to us on a plane or in a classroom are not interruptions to our schedule they are there by divine appointment jesus wants us to see their needs their loneliness their longings and he wants to give us the courage to reach out to them
1514528 evangelism is not a proffesional job for a few trained men but instead unrelenting responsibility of everyone who belongs to the company of jesus
1514529 your lives are echoing the masters word the news of your faith in god is out we dont have to say anything anymore youre the message
1514530 if you live by the same values and priorities jesus had you will find happening naturally it becomes a lifestyle and not a project

1514536 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1514537 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1514538 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1514539 i go to all my friends funerals so theyll come to mine
1514540 i would say we have moved further than we have in decades
1514541 i think the main emphasis is working with first nations and all our counterparts to define how we are going to achieve a project that is viable and meets the net fiscal benefits to the yukon
1514542 if the project remains viable then we move into construction
1514543 i have to commit to being on the road a lot
1514544 with representation from the prairie provinces b c and the yukon it is once again clear that the music industry is alive and kickin and full of world class talent
1514545 tommy banks contributions and pioneering effort have resulted directly in the flourishing recording arts cultural industries in the province of alberta and across the country
1514546 he continues to be an integral part of our industry today
1514547 licensing would only save the evil recording industry yet again
1514548 the original napster had a fine proposition they would charge their users for signing onto their network and write a cheque for as many billions as you like to the record industry every quarter
1514549 its historically inevitable whenever technology makes it impossible to police a class of copyright use weve solved the problem by creating blanket licenses
1514550 begin with a case that is often understood payola payola is the pejorative word used when record companies pay radio stations to play particular songs how would an outside analyst determine the proper payment for the use of the records typically in the economy firms pay for their use of inputs radio uses music as its main input yet radio stations do not pay for the cds that they play quite the opposite there is a history of record producers paying radio stations in order to play their records further radio is a substitute for listening to recorded music and the recorded music industry would almost certainly benefit if radio could be restricted or eliminated although payola is a practice that governments have tried to ban it is in fact indicative of competition between record companies
1514551 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1514552 without om shanti bath salts i simply refuse to bathe
1514553 the longer we delay basically the shorter the window becomes to the point theres no time left and then theres the bigger issue of the loss of the ski hill to the community
1514554 if we have to put a firm date id say that the end of august would be a key date to have a plan in place to start the repairs
1514555 if we get much further even with the funding were running out of time this season to start the repairs because as you get into the fall youre running into the resources may not be available
1514556 the resort has developed to the point it can no longer be run as a small operation it has to be run as a business
1514557 theres no reason that if we can prepare a quality product that they will come
1514558 aha over in the background we see a baby elder god terrorising the local fauna and in this village here we have a tribe of uh non copyright infringing miyamotosaurs
1514559 but thats the same as no one being special at all

1514563 an articulate collection of songs sure to warm your soul with pleasant melodies and story like lyrics an acoustic dream with the kind of tunes thatll lift your spirits during a rainy day it is one of those rare debuts that carry a lot of clout this well orchestrated album comes off gentle and well meaning without being pretentious or overbearing in the way that its so simple and true indie pop has never sounded so good
1514564 and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass the grass withers and the flower falls away but the word of the lord endures forever

1514586 this potential for confusion and misinterpretation of a label by a consumer is limiting to the food manufacturer that uses naturally derived color additives and does not want to disclose the source of coloring

1514616 i love football however i dont love a 40 cost overrun
1514617 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement tomorrow id be as surprised as anybody else

1514619 the courts sentence reflects the gravity of the defendants egregious conduct
1514620 although nothing can erase the scars of a rape hopefully the courts action will help the victim feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is behind bars for life
1514621 this auction will allow us to implement market mechanisms on a small scale gauge interest and determine a slots market value
1514622 however the real winners in this auction will be consumers who stand to benefit from more reliable air service that costs less in terms of both time and money
1514623 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach
1514624 we have deployed additional manpower and have started frisking of people at the bus stand security has been tightened no one is being allowed to go without proper checking terrorist angle behind sundays stampede cant be ruled out and were looking into this also
1514625 the threat was assessed during the recent meetings and intelligence input shared by various agencies after the recent terror attack
1514626 a fully equipped ambulance with essential equipments drugs and stock of compatible blood would be inducted in the vip convoy the ambulance would also be upgraded with crystalloids oxygen cylinders anaesthesia and intensive care medicine
1514627 sonia gandhi and her children enjoy spg protection and there has been recent inputs of attacks on their lives the move has been planned after analysing the threat to her and other family members the level of security has been upgraded a little further
1514628 the aim of such changes is to provide immediate medical aid to the vvips in case of any mishap rushing to any nearby hospital we will lose golden hours and in such situation every minute is crucial
1514629 the political leaders including former prime ministers face serious security threat mainly from kashmiri militants but in case of sonia gandhi she faces equally critical threat from ltte and some remnants of punjab militancy other than kashmiri militants
1514630 the debate is now over which non combatant branches or arms women can get permanent commission in the chiefs of staff committee comprising army navy and iaf chiefs will take a final decision on this within a month or two defense minister a k antony is keen on it
1514631 once permanent commission for women is decided modalities about training at military academies will be worked out it will be an open competition there will be no reservation or quotas in theory an entire nda batch could be of women
1514632 there were cultural adjustments needed when women were first inducted but women have not been found to be unsuitable in anyway i am sure even women fighter pilots will be a reality in the future
1514633 there are physical toughness physiological and practical issues can women be deployed in bunkers along the loc or chase terrorists can you imagine a woman in the hands of an enemy or a terrorist our society is simply not ready for it
1514634 as many as 300 undertrials had been brought to the ghaziabad courts on tuesday morning for hearings at about 10 am the head constable in charge of the police lockup inside the court compound then went into the court building to inform the authorities of their arrival a hundred undertrials were then in the police lockup and the rest in vehicles when head constable lekhraj singh returned 10 minutes later he did a recount and found manoj and inderpal missing one of the bars of the lockup had been cut through
1514635 the five others helped manoj and inderpal escape they have all been booked for engaging in a criminal conspiracy to help the accused escape further investigations are on and no policeman guilty of negligence will be spared
1514636 this was the largest surrender of combatants over the last two three years more are expected to follow with indian peacekeepers facilitating talks between un representatives and armed rebel groups
1514637 the combatants surrendered with 41 weapons including 33 ak 47 assault rifles more surrenders are expected to follow it will go a long way in projecting the face of monuc in bringing peace and stability in the region
1514638 we had 35 people who were responsible for stock verification then today we have just three and this is a library with 50 lakh books
1514639 the cm told us that he has no objection to nalinis release if the centre agrees to it
1514640 i think as a quarterback you are always having to go out there and earn the confidence of a coach that youre a leader
1514641 i have one year left and a chance to do something special
1514642 ben is certainly experienced but i dont know if he has ever been a leader
1514643 every coach has a different style on how they want you to lead
1514644 its good to sit down with the coach and hear what he wants you to do im excited about the chance to prove the type of leader i am
1514645 i have been playing offense my whole life im going to be happy wherever i play its football as long as i have the opportunity to be on field it doesnt matter where im going to play but they gave me the choice to play offense or defense and i chose offense
1514646 the bottom line is were a family but were all trying to get on the field
1514647 the running backs that get on the field are the ones who make the team better the only thing you can do is make sure you play harder than everyone else and were all going to try to do that if youre not doing that then youre not a college athlete
1514648 when i woke up i was in the middle of a row of bodies waiting for postmortem
1514649 my throat was parched and i asked for water towering over me the doctors and nursing staff at anandpur sahib civil hospital looked dazed they must have been surprised to see a dead man come alive like that but when was i dead
1514650 on reaching the stampede site bilaspur district administration officials asked volunteers mostly langarwalas if they have identified the dead it is the job of the administration and not the common man to do it people were dumped quite haphazardly into trucks without following any procedure or checking if they were alive
1514651 when people officials put the bodies in my vehicle i found some of them breathing a few died on their way to hospital had there been doctors at the accident spot many would have survived as they were unconscious merely from suffocation
1514652 considering the number of casualties it was not possible to conduct medical examinations at the site so the anandpur sahib civil hospital was entrusted with the responsibility of declaring people dead
1514653 the matter of dead and injured being packed together would be inquired properly
1514654 we are committed to trying to get colt and john on the field at the same time
1514655 i told john when he reported sunday were going to see if youre in shape or not
1514656 hes getting a bunch of reps at several different places
1514657 all who contradict and oppose the messenger s after the right path has been clearly shown to them have followed other than the path of the believers and all who follow other than the path of the believers have contradicted and opposed the messenger s if one thinks that he is mistaken in following the path of the faithful believers he is in the same position as one who thinks that he is mistaken in following the messenger s

1514659 toen we weersvoorspellingen van 4 5 bft hoorden hadden we direct een hoop lol we hadden al vernomen dat veel teams zoveel wind gecombineerd met hoge golven niet gewend zijn de afgelopen weken hebben we bij onze trainingen vergelijkbare condities gehad voor de hollandse kust die zouden nu wel eens hun vruchten af kunnen werpen
1514660 we zagen de italianen voor ons over de kop gaan en dan lig je ineens weer eerste maar ook wij konden de boot vlak voor de finish niet meer houden en gingen ten onder onbeschrijfelijk gevoel als je de fransen en de duitsers dan aan je voorbij ziet gaan maar we zijn dik tevreden met onze tweede plaats
1514661 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
1514662 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
1514663 there are things that can be done without the necessity of reforming the constitution
1514664 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1514665 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community
1514666 eat colorless tasteless sludge once a day and they only drink lukewarm water

1514669 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1514670 because right now my season with just two wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1514671 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into this event i would have loved to have won last week theres no arguing that point but i really needed to be there like i was
1514672 when im playing a course im trying to take half the trouble out of play
1514673 so i want to set up down the right edge of the fairway and hit a cut and if i miss it left it doesnt bother me what bothers me is if i hook it
1514674 because i missed it to the side i wanted to miss it
1514675 nothing ever was going to get as tough as birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
1514676 the irony will be that the u s open could be the easiest course we play all year
1514677 if one of the big hitters is piping it theyre going to have a good week
1514678 sir if youre done with that mirror maybe youd like to take some time to admire someone else
1514679 in no way has the arizona republican party its chairman of its staff members been actively involved in some sort of recruitment process nor have we discouraged anyone who has been entertaining the idea of getting into the race to do so
1514680 ken bennett is the eighth arizona republican to acknowledge that national republicans lack resources and wont be able to invest in arizonas 1st congressional district
1514681 democrats have the resources are committed to arizona and will work hard to bring change to arizona families
1514682 at this point it looks like they may write this race off
1514683 the book hasnt been written yet so theres still opportunity to focus on it but its going to be a tough race to compete in
1514684 most of what sydney hay stands for i probably agree with its just a matter of how do you communicate that with voters and she may be able to do that as well
1514685 her base is very conservative and thats not necessarily in tune with the politics of the district
1514686 she doesnt have a track record showing that she speaks to the diversity of the district
1514687 ann kirkpatrick has been a state legislator and has represented broad constituencies and she does have relationships for instance with native americans
1514688 sydney hay is a great candidate and will make a fine congresswoman
1514689 with mccain at the top of the ticket and a bitter and divisive democratic primary brewing republicans stand a good chance of holding onto the seat
1514690 we trust local republicans to nominate who they believe will be the best general election candidate
1514691 clinton is fighting off obamas drive to make it a close race in the pennsylvania democratic primary holding the six point edge she had a week ago she seems to have halted the erosion of whites and white women in particular from her campaign and even gained back some ground in the philadelphia suburbs
1514692 we did not hear a whole lot of gnashing of teeth
1514693 we have so many large filings and such a large number of clients it would be hard for us to manage the process if we had to use the congressional web site
1514694 the folks on the hill have been very cooperative helping us work those things out
1514695 we had a few people who were holding out hope
1514696 the challenge will be the report thats due in july
1514697 i have to go back and re read the guidelines
1514698 this has been a busy and possibly confusing time for elections in our state
1514699 with his involvement in the community his concern on business and tax issues and his core conservative family first values theres no doubt in my mind that jeff is the right person to send to washington to represent the 4th congressional district
1514700 and already had plane tickets out the next day back to colorado
1514701 essentially the nuance being argued is that when he signed his petition and his oath of intent to run youre saying that was fraudulent and therefore the whole petition is invalid
1514702 but what really has to take place is a trial to determine if mr unanue never really had the intent to run for office and thats a very hard thing to prove
1514703 after much thought and careful consideration i have decided to end my candidacy for u s senate
1514704 dick zimmer was a great congressman and he will be a great standard bearer for our party
1514705 proven himself as the kind of reformer we need to change washington
1514706 i wholeheartedly endorse dick zimmer for u s senate i have already committed to him that i will play a significant role in his campaign
1514707 i liken myself to one of those airplanes that leaves the gate late and then just gets a nice tailwind and ends up getting there on time anyway
1514708 out of touch and out of control and i want to bring measure to that and bring the peoples voice back to the house
1514709 he has worked very hard in the last year and a half to establish a very strong relationship with the voters in that district
1514710 this is a tough district as you know its one of the toughest in the country from the democrats perspective however hes gotten out and proved himself
1514711 pete olson has proven himself to be one of the top republican challengers in the country and we believe he has exactly what it takes to win in november
1514712 under bushs america when he leaves office gas is going to cost you know 4 plus at the pump the dollar is at its weakest millions of people have lost their homes in foreclosures students it will be made more difficult for them to go to college in terms of student loans
1514713 elections have consequences and thats why we hope people come out and vote because the countrys a lot worse off than it was seven years ago
1514714 all we want to do is have it hit bottom now so it can start going up
1514715 ive always been committed to the principle that its not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly whether theyre big banks or small borrowers
1514716 if he decides no then he would move to make more proposals
1514717 it almost doesnt matter if the democrats proposals are any good or not
1514718 people buy houses as a financial investment youre in this house youre in this neighborhood its a sign that youve made it to the middle class
1514719 for the middle class a home is such a central piece of the american dream when you mess with that its like messing with the american flag
1514720 i think the democratic presidential contenders have clearly crossed a line he didnt want to cross and turned this into a political issue
1514721 the real problem right now is that the property values are going down so you could literally be sitting in your home not facing foreclosure not having a problem paying your mortgage except that the house youre paying the mortgage on is now worth less than what you owe
1514722 so youre paying your mortgage but you actually have lost money even though you have not been faced with foreclosure because neighbors of yours have been put into a tough situation
1514723 additional funding is needed to enable cities to maintain and purchase abandoned properties to support housing counseling and legal assistance and to provide bankruptcy relief to our citizens by allowing judges to modify mortgages
1514724 gt video housing politics mix in philadelphia clinton supporters wondering will she be nominated at the convention
1514725 i really havent thought about that because im in it to win it
1514726 this is a situation when its time for a change and its time for equal representation
1514727 if regina thomas does the same thing she could defeat john even though john will raise a ton of money
1514728 i dont think shell come close to matching him in terms of fundraising but i dont think shell need to
1514729 the evolution of politics on the internet has allowed people to engage affect analyze discuss applaud and dissent from their government in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago
1514730 after decades of citizens feeling more and more detached from their government the internet is allowing that trend to reverse and nowhere with more passion and brilliance than the blogosphere
1514731 we understand the importance of embracing technology and all types of media including blogs in helping to spread our message to the widest possible audience
1514732 sen mcconnell felt that an area where senate republicans could improve our communications was with the blogosphere which is why weve worked hard to put interaction with bloggers on the same footing with tv radio and print
1514733 when working with new media its important to understand that you cant treat bloggers like journalists
1514734 for journalists its their job to report but bloggers have to be particularly interested since thats why they blog in the first place its therefore important that you have an interactive relationship with bloggers to know which issues interest them only then can you provide material that is effective
1514735 the blogosphere and other emerging sources in the new media are tremendously important ways for the american public to find out whats really going on
1514736 i am running for congress because the people of northwest louisiana are ready for change and need a strong independent voice who will stand up for our values
1514737 this will mark my 10th year in congress and i think its time for donna and i to focus on our family
1514738 its time to face reality i have four grandchildren and i barely know them
1514739 this is a republican district and it will again be represented by a republican next year but for me this is the right time to close out this chapter
1514740 it probably means they think that being in the minority is not as happy a time as being in the majority
1514741 theres only one hold up that is sen obama period end of story
1514742 the ball is in the obama court and the ability of the state of michigan to be counted in this process is in many respects in his hands
1514743 all hes got to do is get on the phone get in front of a microphone get in front of a tv camera and say there should be a revote in michigan
1514744 received a very complex proposal for michigan revote legislation today and are reviewing it to make sure that any solution for michigan is fair and practical
1514745 weve said from the beginning that we were willing to assist if the democrats could present a unified front as to how they would like to proceed with fixing the problem that they have created but they cant get unified
1514746 need to come up to a solution that they can all get behind and then we wont stand in their way but it doesnt seem that theyre able to do it
1514747 i think its the best solution so that everybody will have a chance to vote for whomever they want
1514748 this option would require the passage of legislation by the state legislature and we look forward to working with the members of the legislature in the coming days to see if this option can be made a reality
1514749 i will continue to work with all involved to resolve the issue of seating our delegates at the national convention
1514750 michigan is critical to electing a democratic president and electing a democratic president is critical to michigan
1514751 we look forward to learning more details about what they propose
1514752 we will evaluate the details of any new proposed election carefully as well as any efforts to come to a fair seating of the delegates from michigan
1514753 we hope a resolution can be arrived at that is fair and practical and look forward to building a winning campaign in michigan for november
1514754 we need to acknowledge the reality that no progress is being made and without a valid and viable proposal another primary in michigan will soon not be an option
1514755 i do not understand what senator obama is afraid of but it is going to hurt our party and our chances in november and so i would call on him once again to join me in giving the people of florida and michigan the chance to be counted as we move forward in this nominating process
1514756 we look forward to working with the michigan democratic party and the dnc to achieve that goal senator obama looks forward to building a winning campaign in michigan in the fall as our democratic nominee
1514757 regardless of candidate preference members had concerns over the estimated 100 000 michigan democrats who would have been unable to participate in a do over election as well as logistical and legal difficulties faced by local clerks
1514758 voters in south dakota will have a clear choice in november
1514759 my gut feeling now is that who we have in the race is who its going to be
1514760 i think some of the candidates who had considered running were reluctant to run against johnson this year because it would be a very very difficult campaign to run even legitimate criticisms about voting records and things like that would be seen as personal attacks
1514761 part of it has to do i think with the fact that johnsons extremely popular in the state part of it has to do with the recent events and i think part of it has to do with the fact that we dont have anybody on the republican side that is a clear front candidate unless somebody like gov rounds decided to turn around and run which is not likely anytime soon
1514762 mind you im just private citizen and the senators own campaign comes after me and uses my perceived balance sheet as a fundraising tool it was a creepy thing to do with someone who hasnt even announced yet
1514763 he wont choose rock 3 times in a row right
1514764 the longer this goes on the more disappointed voters there will be frankly thats one cause for my optimism
1514765 if i had to admit where i was leaning a couple of days ago i think you probably had that right but i am trying to remain open to all the possibilities and now with this development im kind of starting over almost
1514766 their input and agreement if forthcoming will be important in making this decision
1514767 at the end of the day i had to decide that where i can best serve the people of the state that i love and have the most impact on public policy and right now that is on the commission
1514768 i have always felt very strongly about wanting to help fix things in our government that you do at a federal level or the state level which was what kind of drove me into politics in the first place but the main decision point will be if this is right for my family right now
1514769 both potential candidates have yet to answer important questions about how they and their family benefitted from their positions in the state senate and corporation commission
1514770 democrats are rightly worried about their chances with a fractious and bruising primary looming and
1514771 a champion for the people and a stalwart fighter for protecting arizonas environmental and cultural legacies
1514772 i dont think its going to be easy and i dont think that because its a democrat leaning district i dont think they should take for granted that this is theirs
1514773 i expect him to win the primary and be a strong independent boy for all the people
1514774 we are very excited about our probability of picking up this seat
1514775 i still think that we have a great shot due to the past election results
1514776 we might see a switch like in 64 when goldwater came through that district
1514777 he would be considered a favorite i would think to win the nomination
1514778 he has good conservative democratic voters all across the district that will be supporting him
1514779 some people counted me out and said to drop out but the american people dont quit and they deserve a president who doesnt quit either
1514780 i might stumble and i might get knocked down but as long as you are with me i will always get right back up because for me in the end the question isnt whether we can keep americas promise its whether we will keep americas promise
1514781 she undercuts the rationale for her candidacy that led this page and others to support her that she is more qualified right now to be president than mr obama
1514782 your support has meant the difference between winning and losing now we can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively so i hope youll go to hillaryclinton com and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands
1514783 by the time we finish this process hillary clinton will move ahead in the popular vote
1514784 with all eyes on todays contest one thing is clear pennsylvania is considered a state tailor made for hillary clinton and by rights she should win big she has family roots in the state
1514785 she has the support of the democratic establishment including governor edward g rendells extensive network and former president clinton is fondly remembered
1514786 it was a win across the state this was not a win in one area or in one group
1514787 we continue to believe that the michigan delegation should be seated at the democratic national convention while avoiding a fight before the credentials committee or on the floor of the convention we believe that the best hope of achieving this objective is the passage of the bill before the state legislature creating a state run primary in early june which would not use any state funding
1514788 until we see some kind of unified front from the democrats in terms of what direction they want to go and will the outcome be accepted by all parties theres not going to be any action taken on the legislation
1514789 so riddled with problems that they overwhelm any possible positive outcome for the people of michigan
1514790 there are a number of fair and easy solutions to this mess like splitting michigans delegates in half 50 percent for obama and 50 percent for clinton that would guarantee that our delegates are seated without having to spend countless of millions of dollars that we could spend in the fall
1514791 could put at risk the running of the election undermine acceptance of the results if the election is held and in both cases effectively deny michigan voters a second consecutive time meaningful participation in the nominating process
1514792 are serious in both their nature and in their potential if not likely impact on the june 3 election proposal
1514793 i will always defend your right to vote no matter who you choose to vote for in the end
1514794 it is not about that at all because i believe that michigan families are just as important as the families in any other state
1514795 sen obama speaks passionately on the campaign trail about empowering the american people today im urging him to match those words with action to make sure the people of michigan and florida have a voice and a vote in this election
1514796 i have accepted the plan for a new vote in michigan i call on sen obama to do the same this is a crucial test does he mean what he says or not
1514797 hes got a backing of a strong senatorial district hes got a very well known name in that area
1514798 i am running for congress because the people of north alabama need a strong independent voice who will stand up for our values in washington
1514799 i promise to fight for alabamas families and carry on congressman cramers proud tradition of effective independent representation for our district
1514800 he may be one that can really reach across the aisle and work with republicans on issues but remain a solid democrat too
1514801 i just figured all along that with all the early galvanization around terri bonoff that this was just going to be over and that just may not be whats going to happen at this point
1514802 good friend and a strong voice for our progressive values
1514803 while his substantive contributions to our debates will be missed i know jim will continue his great efforts throughout our district and i look forward to working with him
1514804 i have a vision for change in this country and i wholly believe that mayor hovland shares that vision
1514805 jim and i are both from this district and have a track record of working to bring a broad coalition of people together to make progress for our community
1514806 learn more about our campaign and to join us in the upcoming senate district conventions
1514807 the dccc invested over 1 million into the special election in my district in one of the most expensive media markets in the country in an election year rich with opportunities we have to ensure that we can take full advantage of each and every chance for victory
1514808 im extremely grateful to the dccc for their unprecedented support
1514809 the resources and support given by the dccc was critical to my decisive victory and allowed me to successfully communicate my message of change with hoosiers
1514810 certainly the last interview played a part where he indicated that because somebody didnt vote for him that they were not his constituent that is wrong in my estimation
1514811 part of the public trust is even if somebody doesnt vote for us we represent them in the best way that we know how that was something that got me talking a lot more about it
1514812 done a better job representing the state interests than young
1514813 a perfect description of what the nrcc believes is a winning candidate in a blue state
1514814 hes virtually indistinguishable from the democrat in terms of issues other than his claim to be fiscally responsible
1514815 if we run a rino candidate in connecticut we will never have the support of the potential coalition that can win as a republican
1514816 normal conservative republican who favors a strong national defense fiscal responsibility smaller government less spending lower taxes and an unburdened market economy
1514817 what i know about the rank and file of our party is that theyll choose me
1514818 i do know that we are getting an incredible amount of support throughout the town committees in the 5th district were building momentum getting great support from chief local elected officials i cant speak for anybody else but im just looking toward the general election against chris murphy
1514819 we will have a very very good quarter the best quarter weve had so far
1514820 do everything i possibly can to make sure one of us takes the oath of office next january
1514821 i hadnt seen the remarks that ended up playing on youtube repeatedly
1514822 the church is a community that extends beyond the pastor
1514823 i may be a lot of things but im not dumb
1514824 i was not as accurate as i have been in the past
1514825 senator clinton deserves the right to make some errors once in a while
1514826 because ultimately the buck stops with me as commander in chief
1514827 more likely to ask the advice of the current presidents father than the president himself
1514828 i hope and trust that when the super delegates cast their votes at the convention they will represent the will of the voters as you have called for them to do
1514829 its not going to affect how i vote on bills or how i deal with people
1514830 yes it is and obama has many many more but the clintonites always dismiss those victories
1514831 my opponents ran a campaign to get people to vote uncommitted in michigan
1514832 after the events of the last few days mark penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the clinton campaign mark and penn schoen and berland associates inc will continue to provide polling and advice to the campaign
1514833 the meeting was an error in judgment that will not be repeated and i am sorry for it
1514834 the senators well known opposition to this trade deal is clear and was not discussed
1514835 the colombian government considers this a lack of respect to colombians and finds this response unacceptable
1514836 after the events of the last few days mark penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the clinton campaign mark and penn schoen and berland associates inc
1514837 from the following statement it is accurate for the media to say he has been demoted
1514838 demotion doesnt answer general president hoffas concerns mark penn is still on her payroll and payroll
1514839 someone like mark penn should not be dictating strategy and possibly legislation for a democratic candidate for president
1514840 if i had the opportunity to act now based on what i know now i never would have voted that way
1514841 there is scant evidence to tie saddam to terrorist organizations and even less to the sept 11 attacks indeed saddams goals have little in common with the terrorists who threaten us and there is little incentive for him to make common cause with them there is little evidence to indicate that the united states itself is an object of his aggression
1514842 i will take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a u n resolution and will seek to avoid war if at all possible
1514843 we view this seat as a potential pickup opportunity and we plan to move forward with the recruitment process very quickly
1514844 this is a good time for me to step aside and transition to new leadership
1514845 this was a difficult decision but after 28 years of public service it is time for me to step aside spend more time with my family and begin another chapter in my life
1514846 he is an honorable and remarkable advocate for his constituents and a leader on nasa and tva issues in congress
1514847 would be a tremendous asset to our fight for change in washington
1514848 fought against tax increases and has been a leader in pushing for limited government and an end to wasteful spending
1514849 big badwest coast godless liberals trying to destroy your way of life
1514850 i think candidates have a hard time arguing theyre credible if they dont get 20 percent in the pre primary convention
1514851 if you click on the link you get a window that shows the progress of an automatic download of a so called new version of adobe flash which is supposedly required to watch the video you end up with a file labeled adobe flash its a fake on your machine a technique that is currently very popular
1514852 i have a feeling that this is probably closer to not than yes
1514853 after reviewing the partys proposal and individually discussing this idea with state and local leaders and elections experts we do not believe that this is a realistic option at this time and remain opposed to a mail in ballot election or any new primary election in florida of any kind
1514854 opposed to a mail in campaign or any redo of any kind
1514855 will not accept a seating of the delegates based on what happened in january
1514856 no action is truly a solution if it leaves florida voters feeling that they were excluded from the most exciting nominating contest in history
1514857 the people of florida are not responsible for this dilemma and should not be unfairly punished by losing their right to vote
1514858 in my view at this late hour mail in balloting would be the most practical and fair way to let florida voters have a full say in the selection of their democratic nominee
1514859 has informed the party that this is not an option under the rules
1514860 were not going to give ourselves a false deadline that would inhibit our negotiations
1514861 so if you value the dnc calendar why not just pull out of michigan why not just say hey michigan im off the ballot
1514862 well you know its clear this election theyre having is not going to count for anything
1514863 the michigan democratic party has carefully reviewed several proposals for a party run primary or caucus as a means of resolving the dispute over the seating of the michigan delegation to the 2008 democratic national convention we have concluded that it is not practical to conduct such a primary or caucus
1514864 in a manner which is respectful of the views of democrats in michigan and which is fair to those who voted in the january 15th democratic primary
1514865 united in our commitment to doing everything we can to ensure that a michigan delegation is seated in denver this summer
1514866 we are all committed to doing everything we can to ensure that a florida delegation is seated in denver
1514867 it is now up to the clinton campaign they can agree to a fair resolution or they can continue trying to score political points and change the rules
1514868 we urge senator obama to join our efforts to ensure that the votes of the people of michigan and florida are counted
1514869 its very very important to us that those primary voters dont feel that their votes were wasted
1514870 a lot of other options that we are going to continue to discuss
1514871 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position of power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself for this reason i am resigning from the office of governor
1514872 like all new yorkers i am saddened by what we have learned over the past several days my heart goes out to him and to his family at this difficult and painful time i ask all new yorkers to join michelle and me in prayer for them
1514873 it is now time for albany to get back to work as the people of this state expect from us
1514874 ive talked to him any number of times in the last couple of days and have indicated to him that we will partner and govern forward on behalf of our mutual constituents the people of new york state
1514875 i know david paterson he has the intellectual capacity he has the ability the humor the charisma and the personality to be one of the finest governors new york has ever had
1514876 i am deeply sorry that i did not live up to what was expected of me to every new yorker and all those who believed in what i stand for i sincerely apologize
1514877 david has overcome every obstacle and broken every barrier in his path and i know that hell continue to display that leadership and determination as governor
1514878 i am 20 years younger than my opponent but i have over a decade more experience of being a legislator
1514879 every republican county chair in the district endorsed his opponent last summer
1514880 each of them knows the turf of the other fairly well
1514881 the potential swinger would be on the mountain side that is arguably where broun won it last summer
1514882 im very humbled and very proud to be leading the pack right now
1514883 a strong candidate like dale from that area would pique my interest definitely
1514884 up to the individual if they step down or not
1514885 its just an issue of whose ethics charges do you believe
1514886 an election between a south shore republican and a north shore republican
1514887 theres a sentiment among north shore people that its time for our own congressman and thats going to help tim burns
1514888 steve is running because steve will be the most effective congressman our opponent is trying to run as the north shore candidate hes trying to create this regional divide between the lake and steve does not want anything to do with that
1514889 we both have geographic bases that are separated by a 24 mile lake so it definitely does play a part in it i think the north shore feels that parts of it in particular have been underrepresented in the past and is looking to get fully represented
1514890 that i grew up on the south shore and i have significant south shore ties both current and past ties
1514891 the two areas are not that different there are similar needs and concerns
1514892 every 12 years each of these pods can have a major influence on the election
1514893 we had a de facto national primary on february 5th
1514894 in surveying additional states that might be moving their primaries including ohio there was a general feeling that we would have a national primary in 2012 if we didnt do something about it this year
1514895 shes also going to benefit by the strength of the democratic party the party base is activated
1514896 hes got the albatross of the bush administration hanging around his neck
1514897 he cannot capture independent votes and conservative democratic votes thats beyond his reach
1514898 essentially he is able to go in there from the first day and get things that matter to people in our district accomplished
1514899 hes just so well known hes sort of a controversial figure but he just has most of the party structure behind him and a lot of grassroots activists from all of his years in the legislature
1514900 stagnant but the cost of everything seems to be going up around them and theyre struggling
1514901 i think thats where he offers some solutions and some understanding of those problems
1514902 i think theyre very concerned about dons candidacy because they do see don as a conservative commonsense democrat thats going to appeal to a lot of republicans even
1514903 i have a hard time accepting the notion that its not important to fill that seat when you have a congressional seat vacant
1514904 the congressman is supportive of any measure that will ensure the people of the 4th district are fully represented
1514905 could be beneficial for me for name recognition because it would allow me to have three bites at the apple instead of one
1514906 rob andrews is a real tough act to follow but democrats have a deep bench
1514907 we havent really had the opportunity to sit with the chairs in the other two counties to really go through that
1514908 were not going to lose the seat its been controlled by the democrats ever since jim florio beat john hunt in 1974
1514909 that being said im looking forward to taking on whoever the democratic party puts forward in november
1514910 it will be a wash on status to a great degree
1514911 i will be there to attest to the quality of the woman that i know
1514912 the major movement in obamas direction in pennsylvania could be an indication that democrats in that state think its time to wrap it up
1514913 her strength is her clear advantage among white voters blue collar whites less educated whites economically hurting whites that group known famously as reagan democrats in the keystone state
1514914 obama is marshalling all his forces but despite his eloquent dialogue on the race issue pennsylvania democrats are unmoved so far
1514915 to bring in the next generation in the senate and to build up seniority before inouye steps out
1514916 those who would believe that my age is a handicap or even a reason not to vote for me have been silenced
1514917 and now at age 76 and in failing health he wants six more years
1514918 the right wing of his own party is going after him and democrats think that cases age might make him vulnerable
1514919 has said he is not running against fulbright but is seeking the senate as a newcomer free from the corruption that pervades political washington
1514920 it is critical that in the process of seating a florida delegation that both campaigns are comfortable with the compromises that have to be worked out
1514921 after months of careful deliberations your partys leaders have chosen overwhelmingly to reaffirm our strong commitment to fully participating in the state run democratic presidential primary on january 29 2008 despite the penalties from the democratic national committee there will be no other primary florida democrats absolutely must vote on january 29th we make this election matter not the dnc not the delegates not the candidates but florida democrats like you and me voting together we make it count
1514922 were pleased the court ruled in our favor recognizing the constitutionally protected right of the democratic national committee to enforce its rules and treat all state democratic parties in a fair and equal way the dnc is committed to protecting the right to vote for every american and we look forward to continuing to work together to ensure that florida turns blue in 2008
1514923 florida will play an extremely important role in this election the incredible democratic primary turnout across the state of florida and in all of the early primary states is proving that this entire nation is hungry for change the nation needs florida and florida is ready to deliver
1514924 look at the end of the day we want to unify the party including michigan and florida and thatll be my job but right now thats not on my horizon right now weve got to get through the next couple of months of this continuing contest
1514925 ill say what i said again ill say its in my interest to have a unified party including michigan and florida and i dare say michigan and florida will ask for reinstatement and the credentials committee which will not be under my control will make that decision at that time
1514926 well the party better be on its knees praying that it doesnt come down to the convention because if the outcome were decided on the seating of michigan and florida and therefore that would go one way or another to either candidate then that leaves the party in so much turmoil that it would be hard to repair that breach with the general election only being 60 days hence
1514927 so im hoping that better heads will prevail that they will work out a compromise of seating florida and michigan
1514928 were glad to hear that the governors of michigan and florida are willing to lend their weight to help resolve this issue
1514929 i think its very unlikely that florida and michigan given how close this race is are going to be seated as is but everybodys going to work very hard to find a compromise within the rules thats fair to both campaigns that will allow florida and michigan in the end to be seated
1514930 were working hard for a solution i was actually in florida last night i spent yesterday on the phone with members of the congressional delegation so there is a fair way to resolve this but the key is it has to be fair to both sides were three quarters of the way down the track to selecting a nominee and whatever we change in the middle of all this has got to be fair to both sides
1514931 a party run primary or caucus has been ruled out and its simply not possible for the state to hold another election even if the party were to pay for it
1514932 this doesnt mean that democrats are giving up on florida voters it means that a solution will have to come from the dnc rules amp bylaws committee which is scheduled to meet again in april
1514933 we are all committed to doing everything we can to ensure that a florida delegation is seated in denver we all agree that whatever the solution it must have the support of both campaigns
1514934 while there may be differences of opinion in how we get there we are all committed to ensuring that floridas delegation is seated in denver were committed to working with both campaigns to reach a solution as soon as realistically possible
1514935 were more optimistic today than we have been in a long time
1514936 congratulations to andr carson on his victory tonight he is a tireless leader for the children and working families of indianapolis
1514937 the republican party will look very very closely at this race from a national perspective because we need to pick up some seats
1514938 i think he understands that part of the job in being in the executive branch is respecting members of the legislative branch
1514939 there are way too few people in the political realm who know when and how to laugh at themselves
1514940 only the big historically democratic states should count and so the big state primary winner is said to have the clear edge and has earned the mantle of real democrat support
1514941 reduced by fifty 50 percent and the number of its alternates shall also be reduced by fifty 50 percent
1514942 these candidates have come out of the gate strong and the red to blue program will give them the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive in november
1514943 the surge in democrats preference for clinton that gallup detected earlier in the week has started to move out of the three day rolling average and the race is back to a near tie it is possible that obamas aggressive efforts to defuse the wright story including a major speech on the race on march 11 have been effective
1514944 obama has yet to recover fully from the apparent damage done by the wright controversy it was only one week ago that obama led the race by a significant six point margin over clinton 50 to 44
1514945 considering the losses that obama took in texas and ohio and when you add to it the negativity of the comments attributed to reverend wright thats two shots to the body that obama is having trouble dealing with
1514946 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
1514947 would work well with both parties in washington to get things done
1514948 is someone you would be proud to have as president
1514949 i would say harper has a good shot at getting a lot of votes
1514950 turnout was low three and a half weeks ago so thats certainly a concern anytime you have a runoff election
1514951 in recent years several gop candidates have done well in spring polls only to see their hopes fade in the fall
1514952 i just decided lets do it the old fashioned way lets pay 300 and get a new pair of shoes and well go out and try and convince a majority of the voters at least on sept 9 that im better than the other person whoever it might be and i feel real comfortable about it
1514953 tim walz s liberal record of tax hikes and runaway spending will provide us with plenty of campaign fodder
1514954 republicans brian davis and dick day offer nothing more than the same failed politics that have led america into recession debt and insecurity
1514955 i believe that sen clinton should remain in this race
1514956 i dont agree with some of my colleagues comments this week
1514957 hes able to dissolve the hard cynical edge that has dominated our politics under the bush administration
1514958 theres nothing like being in costco and getting a call from a presidential candidate
1514959 an incredibly vulnerable incumbent who was elected in a very good year for the democrats who does not represent the district very well at all
1514960 we hope somebody steps forward tomorrow but we do not have anybody yet
1514961 certain elected officials think they have the right to anoint who can run
1514962 how can be the head of the red to blue program and not be willing to fight republicans in her own backyard
1514963 she has to step down as chair of the red to blue program or be removed from that position by the dccc
1514964 all candidates from florida to alaska have criteria that have to be met to get on this targeted list
1514965 let me guarantee that if they fulfill those criteria these three democratic candidates will be part of our red to blue program
1514966 we are proud of what you have achieved in this early stage and look forward to working with you to meet the critical challenges ahead
1514967 the democratic challengers have all been very well received theyve been told if their campaigns are successful and they raise money and do what they are supposed to do they will receive the full support of the dccc
1514968 i think they are also not completely oblivious to the idea that jenkins might be the stronger candidate and that shes no moderate in the sense of new york or connecticut moderates
1514969 the word moderate out here you end up using it but you almost want to put quotation marks around it
1514970 we are seeing on the ground that people are ready to turn the page
1514971 this is a republican district and they want a republican representing them but like most of the nation theyre ready to look forward
1514972 but she did spend 20 years practicing public accounting and balancing a budget
1514973 the question is who can pull the most votes from their home base and who will be able to make the most inroads into somebody elses base
1514974 itll come down to who can build on their local endorsements this is very much a get out the vote effort
1514975 the problem in new jersey is that we have borrowed 20 to
1514976 we know in new jersey that a lot of people dont know their own legislator let alone another legislator
1514977 but kate is established in own right as a young up and comer
1514978 im one of few candidates that has experience in fighting and campaigning in a competitive area
1514979 my opponent resides in union county i think i can fight her on her own turf
1514980 i believe fiscal issues will be most important as well as views on war in iraq and immigration but im not sure that theres a significant difference among the candidates on those issue
1514981 i think it will more be a function of who can get their message out and who can best articulate their positions so that probably comes down to sen lance and kate whitman because of the money
1514982 im getting support from the dccc in ways i didnt last cycle
1514983 when there isnt somebody who looks like hes the out and out sure bet you get a lot of interest but really none of these candidates at this point have gained traction with voters
1514984 i think he wants to seal the deal really early in terms of that hell not have a major opponent
1514985 he has the money and he might as well spend it now
1514986 when a longtime incumbent becomes vulnerable i think its for one of two reasons
1514987 that this person is no longer one of us hes become something else forgotten about us
1514988 even though hes one of the most powerful senators in the nation hes never lost touch
1514989 has consistently used his seniority to bring home federal funds including more than 8 billion in the last ten years alone max is proud of the work montanans do and he is willing to go to bat for them in washington
1514990 be a positive part of the process of returning to the foundational truths established by our forefathers
1514991 concrete magnate martin ozinga is the last thing illinois voters need
1514992 in addition to there being a huge question mark on where he stands on the issues ozinga needs to fully answer a series of questions about his ethical problems and willingness to bend or break the rules to make a buck
1514993 a scare tactic to try to scare ozinga out of the race because the dccc views him as a serious threat
1514994 this doesnt change very much for us sen halvorson will continue traveling the district and talking to the voters just as she has been doing
1514995 theres not a district anywhere in the country with that kind of population makeup that is represented by a republican
1514996 i certainly think there is going to be an obama effect
1514997 but i think it is going to be to our benefit because he articulates what the democratic party stands for in washington and thats a liberal agenda that is out of touch with georgia values
1514998 from day one you have to adopt the attitude that if youre running you have to worry about this race
1514999 we cant control what happens with the republican nomination or the democratic nomination and we cant control national voting trends what we can control is what we do here
1515000 were going to ask the people of georgia if they are going to return harvard educated trial lawyer
1515001 were not going to match him barrow dollar for dollar but we dont have to match him dollar for dollar
1515002 its not necessarily who has the most money its who has the best campaign who has the best message and who knows what the people want
1515003 the democrat incumbent it doesnt matter what you do to him the democrats are going to vote for him and the republican candidate it doesnt matter who it is it could be mickey mouse and the republican voters would vote for him
1515004 the problem is the swing vote the independent voter and right now if you do not excite the voter if you do not give them someone to vote for theyre just not going to vote
1515005 the major reason burns held so close in 2006 was name recognition and the campaign contributions he was able to collect as a former congressman
1515006 were going to ask the people of georgia if they are going to return harvard educated trial lawyer john barrow to washington or if they are going to elect a representative that is going to go up and fight for their values
1515007 so i correct in understanding that theirs something wrong with graduating from harvard and studying law do georgia values not want no body with no kinda eddycation dey dont need nuna dat smart jabba round dey
1515008 fear is a habit so is self pity defeat anxiety despair hopelessness and resignation
1515009 unknown clinton supporters wondering will she be nominated at the convention
1515010 i believe i can best serve the people of our community by staying at my post in the legislature at this critical juncture and continuing the fight for lower taxes and for government and budget reform
1515011 ive been asked by a number of groups and people to consider it so im listening at this juncture im in the listening mode
1515012 im the only one with capitol hill experience and im well familiar with the district
1515013 both hillary and bill clinton made peace in ireland a priority while they were in the white house and after
1515014 tyranny dictatorship would be easier as long as i were the dictator
1515015 why would anyone vote republican they are not fiscal conservatives they squandered money on no bid contracts and myriad other forms of cronyism and corruption they turned a plush surplus into an absymal defecit
1515016 they have ruined the country its reputation and its future for a good long time to come thats their problem im amazed therere any left
1515017 not to disagree with anything you stated but what is your idea of a
1515018 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1515019 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1515020 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1515021 unfortunately someone who i thought was a terrific candidate ended up pulling out of the race
1515022 i was obviously very disappointed with him for doing that
1515023 halvorson has been running and raising money for six months now so were six months behind in that sense
1515024 the democrats have been kind enough to give us a candidate who we can contrast with
1515025 america is going in the wrong direction and congress needs someone who is going to make tough decisions and if it costs them their jobs so be it
1515026 but now the reality is that they are being used as a tool to build professions and individual causes
1515027 heal the sick clothe the naked and bring peace to individuals in their finances
1515028 a way to buy votes and get money for political contributions
1515029 erickson may feel that hes got a right to be in this thing since he ran for the seat when the nomination wasnt worth anything
1515030 but republicans are going to look at mannix as someone who has paid his dues to the party
1515031 a financial conservative someone who understands small businesses and the challenges they face
1515032 schrader has more connections and contacts that hell be able to call on especially in his base in clackamas county
1515033 the lack of competitive races on a state level is going to fuel interest attention and money into the 5th
1515034 is liked more by the democratic party than by the republican party down here
1515035 have been happy with graham i never expected them to come up with anybody and they havent
1515036 senator graham has knowingly supported issues that are against the will of south carolinians and is putting the stability of our great country in jeopardy
1515037 south carolina very seldom votes incumbents out of office we like our incumbents either democrats or republicans
1515038 there have been disagreements among republicans in south carolina but at the end of the day these are family disputes and we dont think thats going to hurt the candidate whos going to eventually emerge from that primary hes going to be fine in november
1515039 i looked at both the candidates and basically the reason i chose to shift allegiance over to obama was how i perceived his message of hope
1515040 one of the things i think is wrong with our country is that the people have been left behind by big business big corporations big government big everything we need a return to we the people no exceptions from my perspective obama seems to be more aligned with the peoples interest rather than big corporate interests and government interests
1515041 whereas hillary is to me a vote more for the same old same old politics as usual
1515042 i think it is time for a change and if edwards is not the man to make the change obama is
1515043 we need a fresh look at social services more health care more educational investment
1515044 it was kind of a gut level who did i feel more comfortable with
1515045 the most segregated hour in american life occurs on sunday morning
1515046 the most segregated hour in american life occurs on sunday morning
1515047 i was thrilled to get senator cochrans phone call offering his support and i am very humbled by it
1515048 senator cochran is our states most powerful voice in washington and all mississippians respect and admire him his confidence means a lot to me
1515049 i know you will work to preserve and defend the principles we both share
1515050 president bush has demonstrated a strong commitment to the tennessee valley authority and the region it serves with todays naming of glenn mccullough as tva chairman
1515051 i guess raul martinez is counting on splitting the vote in hialeah with even though hialeah is overwhelmingly republican and then winning the rest of the district where the democrats are a little bit stronger the northern part of the district which is in broward county
1515052 in a perfect world for him lincoln it would be very difficult for him to lose that seat because its pretty republican
1515053 however in the real world lincolns got a much more viable opponent than mario
1515054 fidel castro could be dead in the ground and hed still be the number one issue in local politics
1515055 no clear mandate at all in this district so that makes my job probably tougher not easier
1515056 it really does come down to who you believe will be the best leader in this country
1515057 i did ask about the tone and how are you going to bring the party together in the end no matter what happens
1515058 davis said she inquired of clinton during a question and answer session
1515059 she stated very strongly that she would do everything in her power no matter what happened to do that
1515060 a so called superdelegate is i believe expected to weigh and balance ones own preference for any candidate the preference expressed in a district or state viability or electability and the potential of superdelegates to weigh in at a convention in a way that would add to an eventual nominees electability by affecting any margin of convention victory
1515061 massachusetts voters were clearly enthusiastic about their choices this election i share that enthusiasm
1515062 the respective campaigns appear to be equally enthusiastic about reaching out to all voters both directly and through surrogates and that is to be expected and respected as i have stated previously i have not announced my vote and i have no present plans to do so in the immediate future
1515063 what the politicians want is to not have anybody in the party feel like this thing was stolen and thats different from protecting their own hides or being risk averse
1515064 they just dont want people to go into the general election with a bad taste in their mouth and that may be impossible
1515065 they are hoping for a process that will either allow the voters to decide or to allow the voters to feel like they have decided after the superdelegate process is born out if it has to come to that
1515066 we win because were right on the issues and because were willing to say the truth to people
1515067 new mexico republicans understand that we must nominate a common sense conservative who can win in november
1515068 thats why we proved the pundits and my opponent wrong we picked up more support than anyone had predicted the momentum has shifted our way
1515069 we know that taking back the white house is not enough
1515070 we watched what not having 60 votes in the senate has done to our agenda we know that we cant afford this kind of obstructionism if we are actually going to spend the next four years addressing the issues that are critical to the success of our country
1515071 will not only look for races where democrats are competitive but we will actually look for races where we can make them competitive where we can take people who are lagging behind in the polls and push them over the top
1515072 it is time however for democrats to stop fighting amongst ourselves and to prepare for the tough fight we will face against
1515073 senator obama has started a discussion in this country long overdue and rejects the politics of pitting race against race
1515074 he understands clearly that only by bringing people together only by bridging our differences can we all succeed together as americans
1515075 as a hispanic i was particularly touched by his words i have been troubled by the demonization of immigrants specifically hispanics by too many in this country hate crimes against hispanics are rising as a direct result and now in tough economic times people look for scapegoats and i fear that people will continue to exploit our racial differences and place blame on others not like them
1515076 and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states
1515077 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time
1515078 i am sick of negroes who just do not get it hillary was not a black boy raised in a single parent home barack was
1515079 barack knows what it means to be a black man living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people hillary can never know that hillary aint never been called a epithet hillary has never had her people defined as non present hillary aint had to work twice as hard just to get accepted by the rich white folk who run everything
1515080 the fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that weve never really worked through a part of our union that we have yet to perfect
1515081 and if we walk away now if we simply retreat into our respective corners we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every american
1515082 we can play reverend wrights sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the election and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the american people think that i somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words
1515083 we can pounce on some gaffe by a hillary supporter as evidence that shes playing the race card or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to
1515084 i can tell you that in the next election well be talking about some other distraction and then another one and then another one and nothing will change
1515085 i have asserted a firm conviction a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union
1515086 for the african american community that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past
1515087 it means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of american life
1515088 but it also means binding our particular grievances for better health care and better schools and better jobs to the larger aspirations of all americans the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling the white man whose been laid off the immigrant trying to feed his family
1515089 and it means taking full responsibility for our own lives by demanding more from our fathers and spending more time with our children and reading to them and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives they must never succumb to despair or cynicism they must always believe that they can write their own destiny
1515090 the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the african american community does not just exist in the minds of black people that the legacy of discrimination and current incidents of discrimination while less overt than in the past are real and must be addressed not just with words but with deeds by investing in our schools and our communities by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations
1515091 i believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories but we hold common hopes that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place but we all want to move in the same direction towards a better future for of children and our grandchildren
1515092 when theres an open seat a lot of politicians jump
1515093 believes there are significant problems that need to be addressed
1515094 the candidates are almost more happy to run against president bush than each other
1515095 even in the worst political environment in a generation the voters of this community returned me to office for a fifth term
1515096 which leaves me no doubt that had i broken with tradition and sought another term i would have succeeded
1515097 hes not the strongest republican for that district they may be able to hold that district better with him gone oddly enough
1515098 so many voters already know me and know my record of accomplishment
1515099 theres people who think that somebody whos a 75 year old guy is too old to do it but i dont i have a passion in my belly for the working class people and i think i can represent them better than a young guy like powers
1515100 lets see its unfair to work hard and make money and to spend it for a good cause if powers worked hard like i did then he would have money hes never had a real job
1515101 ill challenge anyone that thinks that our soldiers dont have real jobs if you dont think that teaching and being a soldier is a real job then i think weve got some concerns
1515102 while hes his own man and has to make his own decision were hoping still that with the endorsements that weve received so far and the continuous support that were getting that jack will still back us in the long run
1515103 the reason jack didnt win last time is because he wasnt out there doing the work he wasnt out there doing the grass roots or even talking to voters
1515104 when weve gotten these endorsements its because weve earned them weve talked to all the committee members weve been in their homes weve gone door to door with them
1515105 we must change course and we need to start with new leadership as a working mother attorney and community volunteer i have the experience necessary to bring change i understand the needs and concerns of families in western new york they are my concerns too
1515106 this announcement creates a great opportunity for our district and it puts our campaign one step closer to the goal of bringing real change to washington d c we want to keep up the momentum
1515107 you definitely send people in scramble mode when you see someone retire that close to the qualification deadline
1515108 with all the names that are being thrown around and with the caliber of people that are being discussed i think we have a strong bullpen
1515109 i think we are poised to take that seat and a lot of republicans want to be the person to do it
1515110 know these people and they are on the democratic side
1515111 theres a point when as long as it doesnt get too nasty here its good for people to see where we are as democrats
1515112 i hate to talk about divisions among democrats but its happening
1515113 when i heard obama for the first time i just felt he was the right person for our time
1515114 when the other side says they want to run against clinton that tells you something
1515115 the reality is if youre a democrat in lancaster county youre pretty liberal
1515116 i have a very strong and positive view of the clintons as leaders and of hillary
1515117 it wouldnt shock me i wouldnt wake up and go surprise surprise
1515118 democratic activists in lancaster county are pretty liberal even those who live out in the countryside
1515119 i cannot say i will support whoever the candidate is
1515120 so theyve done there what we need to do here we need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
1515121 y ou turn on the cable news theyre covering again a missing child not a missing country but a missing child we hear about the rape of a woman but not about the rape of the statue of liberty the statue of liberty is crying shes been raped and disheveled raped and disheveled by illegal aliens
1515122 things are so bad in europe that the italians have put soldiers military on their streets now you have to understand what it means by things are so bad the illegal immigrants mainly muslims and africans are out of control
1515123 so theyve done there what we need to do here we need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
1515124 t he local comic books that nobody buys anymore called newspapers
1515125 no truth no reality no stories you turn on the cable news theyre covering again a missing child not a missing country but a missing child we hear about the rape of a woman but not about the rape of the statue of liberty the statue of liberty is crying shes been raped and disheveled raped and disheveled by illegal aliens and our politicians do nothing except give themselves big fat checks and big fat jobs
1515126 were getting refugees now who have never used a telephone a toothbrush or toilet paper youre telling me theyre going to assimilate they will never assimilate they come here and they bring their destitute ways to this country and they never assimilate
1515127 and then their children become gang bangers it is a disaster did you hear what i just said a disaster
1515128 i would say let them fast until they starve to death then that solves the problem because then we wont have a problem about giving them green cards because theyre illegal aliens they dont belong here to begin with
1515129 if you take to the streets with the vermin who are trying to dictate to us how we should run america even though theyre not even entitled to vote or be here youre going to be thrown out of office the people will throw you out of office there are not enough of them to re elect you you will be out of a job you will not have a living you will be hunting for a job maybe youll be picking the vegetables

1515154 since we shifted in march from focusing on oem sales of our visual orchestration system to marketing it directly to end users downloads have been dominated by emerging economies like india and china informal conversations with my colleagues with similar models confirm the pattern is industry wide were not trying to be jingoistic instead we think as we said in the message below that this should be a wake up call to the us development community that change is risky but stasis is fatal

1515222 however we cant pinpoint the main factor as of now but the increase of wheat is definitely a factor

1515225 the us federal reserve left the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 0 percent as widely expected by the market

1515227 when riding a bike one of the most difficult things to do is to balance while trying to stay still

1515229 for now standing still may be enough to ensure that the dollar advances after all most other economies appear to be sliding backwards

1515260 embryonic stem cell research is laden with scientific ethical and moral concerns and in over 20 years has failed to produce a single human medical trial however adult stem cell research which is being ignored by hunt and others has a history of not just clinical trials but proven treatments
1515261 the democratic leaders fascination with embryonic stem cell research is completely politically driven but voters are tired of politicians spending money on project they think will make them popular
1515262 many politicians have said they support embryonic stem cell research because they want to help people if they really want to help people they will stop wasting peoples tax dollars on failed research if they really want to help people they will start supporting the research thats currently curing people that research is adult stem cell research
1515263 this storm could bring in erratic winds and those conditions are the kind that can kill firefighters because in that wind the fires become explosive
1515264 it didnt matter in the end how old they had been or that they were girls but only that we had loved them and that they hadnt heard us calling still do not hear us up here in the tree house with our thinning hair and soft bellies calling them out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time alone in suicide which is deeper than death and where we will never find the pieces to put them back together

1515275 it is not a molecule of choice for most life
1515276 how about we both go on 60 minutes a few days after the dhs starts patting down montana drivers license holders who are trying to get on the planes and both of us can tell our side of the story
1515277 i see the problem we need to get this fixed
1515278 one thing that child witnesses of domestic violence suffer from is post traumatic stress disorder just like our soldiers from iraq and that really touched those who worked on the center
1515279 the thought of having children sitting here waiting and thinking without having anything to do broke my heart
1515280 she loves all the paintings and loves the chalk board
1515281 it has benefitted her tremendously to be able to speak and release some things that have been difficult for all of us
1515282 the patterns almost identical to the burns we saw on a pair of dachshunds that came in in the last 60 days
1515283 the bottom line is asking san antonio voters to lengthen the terms is like asking chickens to vote for col sanders its just not going to happen
1515284 we want to be able to take a project that the city needs and have the accountability and sustainability to both start it keep it going in the middle and finish it
1515285 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1515286 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1515287 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1515288 coach mike mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1515289 the report was that the child had pulled the pot off the stove himself and he was covered with boiling water and subsequently burned

1515292 to turn yourself in so you can go home and live in a village with no work if i wanted to do that i would have stayed in my village i wouldnt have risked my life to come here in the first place
1515293 for them its getting too hard to hide they have the stress of looking over their shoulders
1515294 they know theres a lot of law enforcement looking for them this is their way to go home
1515295 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1515296 were going to push each other to play and to compete
1515297 its going to benefit the team hes definitely a great goalie theres going to be competition obviously but its always like that with any nhl team this year is going to be a little more than the average team but its great were going to work together and make it happen every night so we can get some wins
1515298 as soon as i was on the market the blackhawks were very aggressive
1515299 for me that was a great opportunity to come to this organization
1515300 we want to have an opportunity to have the best goaltending every night if by chance thats not going to work as far as number of games played or not wanting to be here then we have to look at that if its keeping khabibulin we do that if its not then we move on and we try to do something that makes sense for both of us
1515301 ive been with the hawks for 32 years and i dont worry about that kind of stuff
1515302 well just have success and see where that lands im not concerned
1515303 no one has anything to worry about its not like were holding any sword of damocles over anyones head as far as denis were going to do just fine

1515313 it is the just the most enormous thing that has happened in traumatic brain injury research
1515314 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 percent of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
1515315 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
1515316 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
1515317 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
1515318 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conduct a multi year test of this system
1515319 the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence
1515320 if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them
1515321 the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it

1515494 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1515495 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1515496 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1515497 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services 1 8including psychotherapy 3 8
1515498 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1515499 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes

1515528 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1515529 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue
1515530 lessons learned from moving research findings into practical application in agriculture need to be understood shared and expanded
1515531 this special issue of the journal of agricultural health and safety adds to our collective knowledge in this area and provides a valuable basis for expanding and transferring this knowledge
1515532 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1515533 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1515534 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1515535 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1515536 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1515537 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1515538 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1515539 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1515540 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1515541 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1515542 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1515543 its impressive it shows you the kind of person this officer is
1515544 he was injured ultimately he was rendered unconscious but before he fell to the ground he actually walked over to the car and made sure she was ok made sure her children were ok
1515545 yeah probably i mean i torture a lot of people its hard to keep track
1515546 i ask you therefore will you love her honor and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1515547 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights

1515553 i love playing power hockey im very excited for this its been exciting to see this grow over the years
1515554 most people who have never seen power hockey before are a little surprised
1515555 it can get pretty exciting out there for us and it can be for the fans too
1515556 i think they get a little scared to go up against me
1515557 so many people get involved and theres a lot of pretty good competition out there our team should be one that does well
1515558 we are committed to trying to get colt and john on the field at the same time
1515559 i told john when he reported sunday were going to see if youre in shape or not

1515563 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1515564 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1515565 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1515566 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go
1515567 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1515568 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1515569 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1515570 jesus you get it you are it youre the reason for my being and you get me completely
1515571 what is my ultimate purpose if it is not made up of my social roles
1515572 dr hayne has dedicated many many years of his life to ensure that autopsies that were required by the state of mississippi were done

1515574 a close scrutiny of that which is being alleged has been proven to be totally false
1515575 if defense lawyers are able to ask the question have you been fired on the witness stand its going to hurt in all those cases
1515576 if people want to know where all councils money is going this is it
1515577 it just keeps happening we fix it up and it happens again what more can we do
1515578 each time it is just more work that has to be done and more of an inconvenience to the public its an extra cost for council and ratepayers
1515579 in the two recent cases it has been the ladies toilets that are suffering the damage
1515580 a witness said it was a group of young boys dressed in shorts so i would say theyre underage
1515581 they also threw a bottle at one of our house guests who heard them out the back he was very lucky not to have been hurt
1515582 its the first time weve been broken into and we have cctv footage of the robbery in progress so hopefully we can catch them
1515583 there have been other businesses that have been broken into not just here but in other areas
1515584 the tathra bowling club and m amp f agencies in bega have also been robbed in recent weeks
1515585 if its the same group they are pretty active police have a few leads and video footage of our robbery so they might catch up with them
1515586 i certainly havent seen a crime wave like this for a while
1515587 its all expense but weve stepped up our alarm system with new infra red cameras
1515588 relay for life has become an anticipated event on the bega valley social calendar
1515589 the committee and i are really looking forward to working with the people of the shire to put on another uplifting and successful event for our community
1515590 its all donated goods and the people who give and purchase are so important to our work

1515610 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1515611 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1515612 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1515613 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1515614 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1515615 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1515616 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin

1515626 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1515627 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1515628 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1515629 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1515630 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1515631 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1515632 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1515633 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1515634 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1515635 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1515636 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1515637 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1515638 i believe this new proposal will be agreed by all the parties because we have reached a dead end and there must be a new solution
1515639 todays session held to discuss the provincial council elections law was adjourned until tomorrow as parliamentary blocs have not yet reached an agreement on the kirkuk cause
1515640 a permanent us military presence in the kurdistan region is welcome and is necessary to defend iraq from internal and external risks and is important to protect the region but this presence must be within an iraqi kurd american agreement
1515641 kurdish leaders are among the most prominent us allies in iraq and the region and with this permanent us presence not one neighbouring country would dare to threaten the sovereignty of the region and its federal experience and the kurdish population will not to take up arms against the presence if this happens because much of them are have a message of thanks and gratitude for the americans

1515644 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1515645 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1515646 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1515647 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1515648 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1515649 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1515650 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1515651 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1515652 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1515653 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1515654 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1515655 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1515656 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1515657 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1515658 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1515659 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1515660 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1515661 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1515662 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1515663 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1515664 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1515665 especially considering the state of the consumer and a promotional sporting goods sector
1515666 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1515667 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1515668 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1515669 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1515670 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1515671 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1515672 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1515673 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1515674 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1515675 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1515676 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1515677 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1515678 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1515679 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1515680 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1515681 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1515682 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1515683 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1515684 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1515685 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1515686 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1515687 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1515688 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1515689 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1515690 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1515691 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1515692 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1515693 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1515694 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1515695 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1515696 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1515697 it is something ive got to deal with it the rest of the season im going to have good days and bad days some days it feels right sometimes it didnt

1515704 calling it a matter of survival makes it sound grim
1515705 its more a matter of entertainment of course we want our gamers to stay in the world for as long as we can but i look at this from the positive angle of us trying to entertain them were trying to give them new experiences one of my favorite analogies is how much an mmo is like a tv series were developing episodes just like lost or seinfeld were always trying to come up with something thats true to the theory thats true to the content that people love but that is new from the moment that the series starts re treading the same ground over and over again well thats what were trying to avoid
1515706 o governo assumiria atrav s da eletrobr s as duas obras ou faria outro leil o prontamente

1515709 n o acho que seja do interesse do ir fechar o estreito de ormuz ou o golfo p rsico ou tentar fazer isso neste momento os iranianos t m uma economia fr gil quase inteiramente dependente de sua receita petroleira por isso fechar o estreito e o golfo p rsico seria uma esp cie de exerc cio contraproducente

1515764 chinas wind energy market is unrecognisable from two years ago it is huge huge huge but it is not realised yet in the outside world
1515765 a few years ago wind energy was boutique something to show off to foreigners to prove how green they are but now it is a very serious part of their energy policy they can make things happen so quickly in china compared to the west when they make up their minds it is incredible how fast things happen
1515766 its not whether he has experience or is presidential its whether voters can relate to him given his unusual background and his often seeming arrogance talking to germans and having sarkozy embrace you make this problem worse not better if i were the rnc id use the german language obama flier in an ad to make him appear more foreign more distant
1515767 according to shared ideas of what is best for the world as a whole
1515768 the banning of a ruling party one that has been in power for over five years and quite successfully at that is unprecedented in the modern west
1515769 and most of that is customer service for world of warcraft in terms of development staff its probably around 350 world of warcraft is about 135 people 40 for starcraft ii 40 for team 3 our cinematics team is about 85 guys then theres sound and q a and that sort of thing
1515770 team 3 is working on something really awesome i cant give you any hints but its totally awesome
1515771 diablo 3 takes place in heaven hell is trying to take it over and it is awesome looking imagine the brightness of heaven being taken over by the darkness of hell imagine wow but in a diablo world in amount of size and playability also guild housing is available in this game for those of you who know about it
1515772 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1515773 this has yet to be verified inside thermal and evolved gas analyzer instruments
1515774 this does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
1515775 how this perchlorate affects habitability on mars is certainly a complex question that we dont have a final answer on
1515776 it really doesnt limit us in our search for habitability in this icy soil and if we were lucky enough to see some organic signatures we wouldnt be surprised
1515777 were not really a pc company or a playstation or 360 company
1515778 were really about building an mmo as a platform because youve got essentially whats a supercomputer on the backend the question for us as game makers is what to do with that weve barely scratched the surface
1515779 our goal is to continue to build our team and this funding allows us to do that while building that technology base that can be used across multiple games too
1515780 we love the diablo universe and are definitely interested in returning to it at some point in the future
1515781 however at this time were wholly focused on completing the upcoming expansion for world of warcraft
1515782 its an extraordinarily well organised syndicate of fake websites which also deliberately oversells tickets for major events on legitimate websites
1515783 the storys always the same its an unfortunate mistake or someone has let them down they promise a refund which never happens and the credit companies end up paying all the refunds its all part of the elaborate scam

1515786 blizzard entertainment the developer of diablo and diablo ii is looking for a
1515787 our population is getting older browner less educated more welfare dependent and poor in comparison to the national average
1515788 attracting and retaining working families is the fundamental key to wanganuis survival and prosperity
1515789 i could have added real negative correlations to ethnicity if that was my purpose criminal offending prison inmate ratios mental illness child abuse
1515790 one can only presume that the mayor believes the key to wanganuis survival and prosperity is in attracting a population which is younger whiter educated employed and richer than the national average
1515791 maybe its a particular shade of brown thats got him worried wanganuis maori population is higher than the national average while our pasifika and asian populations are considerably lower so did he just mean maori
1515792 it is true that we in wanganui are less well qualified and earn less than the national average but thats something the council can do something about
1515793 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1515794 we couldnt say that alpha was hitting alpha so we needed another name
1515795 but back to my point diablo and his brothers are not allied to hell they are their own faction
1515796 good regulation should drive competition and boost our productivity but too many new rules can stifle enterprise and blunt our competitive edge
1515797 the introduction of a regulatory budget for every department will focus new regulations on the real priorities and act as a powerful incentive for departments to cut or streamline existing burdens
1515798 in 2006 we reclaimed the term mcjob with our not bad for a mcjob campaign and over the past two years we have received considerable support from our employees our customers and business leaders
1515799 we feel the time is now right to take another step forward and start celebrating the mcjobs we offer
1515800 you know as much as i do about their plans but what id like to see is diablo in a true 3d environment taking advantage of the latest graphics bells and whistles and of course the blizzard production values that makes their games special
1515801 what i write in this book will be significant for the diablo 3 game
1515802 i thought that yodobashi multimedia akiba would have them in stock there were so many people i thought i wouldnt be able to buy one so im really happy
1515803 if it wasnt for my father this little game wouldnt be out so i expect news or youll expect to be closed
1515804 i think acre is a very significant addition to farm policy particularly at this point in time because it is designed to help farmers manage the risk they now face
1515805 when i talk to farmers i get this very conflicted statement from them im both excited and scared
1515806 the traditional suite of farm programs assumes it knows we will have chronically high farm surpluses and low farm prices if prices get low enough they trigger a payment
1515807 acre is a revenue price times yield program not a price program more importantly acre does not presume what the market is going to be it just follows the market if prices or yields decline dramatically acre provides support given the market conditions we are in at the time
1515808 its conceptually a fundamentally different program both acre and traditional programs are risk management programs but they manage different kinds of risk traditional programs help manage the risk of chronic low prices acre helps manage the risk of a decline in revenue over the short period of a few years producers need to understand that they cant look at acre through the same eyes they looked at traditional programs and that will be a real challenge
1515809 if you choose acre for corn you must also choose it for wheat and soybeans however this is not a whole farm situation in terms of calculating payment
1515810 acres payment calculation is specific to an individual crop a farmer can receive a payment for corn but not for soybeans
1515811 you are going to give up 20 percent of your direct payments if you choose acre for most corn and soybean farmers that is going to be 2 to 6 an acre per year you are giving up
1515812 i think that the central question that every producer is going to have to answer is is this 20 percent reduction in direct payments more than compensated for by the improved management of risk that acre provides relative to the countercyclical program in todays market of high and volatile prices given the prices and cost of production that exist right now acre provides a better risk management option than the price counter cyclical program it is unlikely that prices will stay below the price level at which payments will be made from the counter cyclical program
1515813 farmers are used to put options on prices this program establishes a put option on state revenue the value at which the revenue put option is established which is acres state revenue guarantee equals the following calculation 90 percent times the 2 year moving average of u s market year price times the 5 year olympic moving average of state yield the use of moving averages of yield and price is why the acre revenue guarantee moves with the market
1515814 current programs do not require that an individual farmer experience a loss farmers can receive a counter cyclical payment and still have record revenue thats not going to happen under acre
1515815 if prices continue to go up then payments under the traditional suite of programs will be greater than under acre why because you are giving up 20 percent of the direct payments and if prices keep going up acre will never trigger a payment
1515816 on the other hand if prices drop substantively acre payments are likely to be larger acre provides you protection in particular to short steep declines in revenue
1515817 we would love to bring certain of the other franchise to the big screen
1515818 they are so focused on wow they are probably not
1515819 so maybe well see a movie before we see a game
1515820 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
1515821 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1515822 this is easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
1515823 these are two very important programs that we provide for the schools which my department recognizews as invaluable to the community
1515824 it all arrives on saturdays and they are kind enough to bring it over
1515825 some of the folks selling at the market have produce in excess that they might not be able to sell its hard for us to get fresh anything throughout the year so its great to have this its fresh healthy and tastes good it saves us having to go out and buy it most of the meals here are prepared by volunteers sometimes they cook here but not often our kitchen is not sufficient for number people we need to feed were putting out 80 plates of food on average each night church groups or families take on a night we get a great variety of stuff that way dinner is probably the only pleasant part of staying here we always serve balanced meals
1515826 this summer however has the most coordinated effort thats ever been done
1515827 i have been involved in local farming for years and in the past it happened at random or occasionally this year there is a collaboration of local groups and we set it up in advance with cross roads house the farmers are getting into the habit of gleaning
1515828 we brought a ton of green beans a couple of weeks ago
1515829 we were swimming in them even though tomatoes are a precious item we do have some they cant sell the seconds that arent as pretty theyre perfectly good but people pass them over
1515830 saving us money at the grocery store and feeding our residents better than ever even introducing them to foods they have not had the pea shoots were really a brand new salad treat for every one i cant wait to see what comes each week thanks so much to all the farmers
1515831 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1515832 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1515833 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1515834 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching

1515876 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan

1515878 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1515879 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border

1515893 para mi es un orgullo poder tener a los jugadores que llegaron
1515894 fueron las primeras opciones que nos planteamos en cada puesto
1515895 con la llegada de maldonado el fichaje de un delantero centro no es prioritario porque puede jugar en el eje del ataque

1515921 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1515922 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1515923 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1515924 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1515925 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1515926 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1515927 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1515928 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1515929 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1515930 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1515931 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1515932 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1515933 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1515934 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1515935 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1515936 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1515962 hay mucho abuso en el aumento imag nese que vamos a hacer y no me explico como lo permiten las autoridades como la profeco pero la realidad es que nunca nos consultaron para saber si estamos de acuerdo simplemente lo cobran y uno tiene que ver de donde saca el dinero porque ante cualquier reclamaci n responden en forma altanera

1515970 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1515971 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1515972 any discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1515973 but in the years now months run up to the olympics the reality has been numbingly disappointing
1515974 i suppose it was just a bunch of words when they made those promises
1515975 when the chinese government is serious about something they do it
1515976 china is a responsible country we will fulfill the promises we made for the olympics
1515977 the ideas out there that china made commitments on human rights but its simply not true
1515978 nobody was in any mood to make any promises then

1516029 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1516030 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1516031 tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1516032 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1516033 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1516034 from our perspective the possibility of resolving the legal case in a manner that allows for a path forward that provides an explicit roadmap enabling e gold to emerge as a regulated financial institution in full compliance with u
1516035 the operations of e gold ltd and the other defendants undermined the laws designed to maintain the integrity of our financial system and created opportunities for criminal activity
1516036 because of the successful prosecution of these defendants digital currency providers everywhere are now on notice that they must comply with federal banking laws or they will be subject to prosecution
1516037 the resolution of the criminal case provides for a second chance an opportunity to address the flaws embedded in the e gold system and to transform the e gold operation into the institutions sic i the other directors and our long suffering employees and contractors have always envisioned one that serves to advance the material welfare of mankind

1516040 by passing this bipartisan bill the senate has taken decisive action to improve the security of our country and make our homeland safer
1516041 it is an immeasurable tragedy that just after its return from the fourth of july holiday the senate has chosen to pass a bill that betrays the spirit of 1776 by radically expanding the presidents spying powers and granting immunity to the companies that colluded in his illegal surveillance program

1516125 mr libby a high ranking public official and experienced lawyer lied repeatedly and blatantly about matters at the heart of a criminal investigation concerning the disclosure of a covert intelligence officers identity he has shown no regret for his actions which significantly impeded the investigation mr libbys prosecution was based not upon politics but upon his own conduct as well as upon a principle fundamental to preserving our judicial systems independence from politics that any witness whatever his political affiliation whatever his views on any policy or national issue whether he works in the white house or drives a truck to earn a living must tell the truth when he raises his hand and takes an oath in a judicial proceeding or gives a statement to federal law enforcement officers the judicial system has not corruptly mistreated mr libby mr libby has been found by a jury of his peers to have corrupted the judicial system
1516126 even if one accepts the presidents assertion that a 30 month prison term for mr libby was excessive it is hard to justify or understand the presidents decision to commute mr libbys prison sentence in its entirety it is particularly difficult to see how in tony snows words the rule of law and public faith in government have been served by enabling mr libby to avoid having to serve even one day in prison following his serious convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice indeed the conclusion to the prosecutions sentencing memorandum submitted to the district court in this case spotlights why a term of imprisonment for mr libby seemed essential and certainly not excessive to both mr fitzgerald and judge walton
1516127 oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1516128 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results

1516135 the mess in my pants is nothing compared to the mess democrats will make of this country if they win nov 2nd
1516136 for her bravery and spirit and tenacity and the sheer fact that she was a woman participating and standing up for her beliefs in a world predominated by men and male values and standards she was a resistance fighter she started a school she was a track star she had a family she was the everywoman and everyperson and also someone i never met shes a fascinating person to draw a character of however she was real shes part of me and that is also inspiring
1516137 i guess i draw from my life from the world i see around me
1516138 from how i see people move through their days and how i observe the decisions they make and my attempt to understand my own decision making
1516139 as a theme i notice i write songs about journeys about leaving and coming back and finding out something that is really just a key to a new door
1516140 all of this to me all these words that i use describe love between anyone or anything i dont know what love is i guess its just this umbrella term for living i guess the emotion of living i try to draw from that
1516141 i was nineteen and i had this idea that i could come home for thanksgiving and tell everyone i wrote a novel
1516142 i havent read it in so long im only on page 20 of editing and i cant remember the end if its ever any good at all maybe ill try to publish it probably not
1516143 i feel like all i want to do right now and for the last while is write for songs because i still feel like i could always be better and the best way it seems to get better is to do the thing you want to be better at
1516144 i was convinced i wanted to go to art school be a sculptor build a visual language for what i had to say
1516145 at some point it became clear to me that whatever i had to say i wasnt able to communicate is as clearly as authentically as i thought i could through words and i dont know where the song idea came from that just started to happen when i opened my eyes looked around and saw musicians and writers people i respected living their lives in song i guess when i realised it was an option i wanted to try it and it felt better than anything else there was also and still is a very vibrant and supportive community of musicians and artists in philadelphia where i was living at the time which made making music easy and fun and accessible and sort of normal this was comforting since it wasnt so normal to want that life at the school i was attending
1516146 i think the emotionality just comes from sort of being sappy about life
1516147 sappy is unfair im just kidding but no its from enjoying life taking it in as fully as possible and then dealing with the consequences of that lyrically well i am enamoured of words words are to me colours to paint with or images to juxtapose building blocks or bricks and i feel like using language and thinking about language building with language is a huge part of how i go about telling a story or conveying an idea through a song
1516148 he has a way about him in the studio and with music that just puts you at ease somehow there is this understanding that it will all be alright and better than alright it will be great hes so smart i mean on all levels and this magic intelligence finds its way into what to do with a song he really feels his way through he can feel a song in a really huge way and get to the heart of it
1516149 scott really helped create the sound of the record we went through decisions together but it was a lot of him saying lets try this hows that and we were on the same page it always felt right but his knack for production is just so informed intuitive and generous really hes unique
1516150 i was hearing this particular sound this really washed out sound sound couldnt tell where one part began and the other ended couldnt make out one word or instrument i like knowing what i hear and i wanted to make a record that you could hear
1516151 i think this will be my goal again amnon friedlin pepis bandmate has an amazing ability to make his guitar sound effected without using any effects its amazing its all within the skill of his hand on the next record youll be able to hear even more clearly every word i sing the story i like records that i can make out a storyline even if its not a linear story
1516152 i think its always fun to move forward and try different clothes and colours on for size how else would you know what feels best
1516153 and what feels best for me is always changing i love red but we did red and now well do the next and it will be different scott has a line in a new song of his that says what comes by chance too comes by choice i cant say i know what he meant for sure but for me this means that if you stay open to situations and to change then it will find you life will find you and change you red was situational we went for it we did a song and i was lucky enough to meet scott at that time and see what was possible i do want to work with him again of course we are arranging the next record together as a band but we are all friends and i bet we can find a cool way to all work together its really a fun idea to think about
1516154 i do play solo sometimes and its a good time i try to look for the silences or fall as deep as i can into the story i try for this with the band too but well im far more animated with the band and i can dance more i really like to dance
1516155 i like to imagine the realm of the possible its sort of like the ring of saturn almost intangible but very real the motivation though i must say is simply to have as much fun as possible my bandmates and i call this being an optimiser im just trying to optimise the fun
1516156 now quick how many australian or new zealand writers can you think of off the top of your head
1516157 ive received threats before and have to take every one seriously you just dont think someone is going to try and kill seven people in the middle of the night
1516158 luckily we had our brooms and shovels because we were cleaning up broken glass anyway you just think to yourself that clearly someone out there has a beef and our family has to take that seriously because a little longer i dont think id be standing here talking to you
1516159 i started throwing bricks to wake them up my dad went to the back joe and his wife came out my dad and joe went back in to get everyone out
1516160 who would have a motive who would have the means weve shared all that information with arson investigators and the fbi

1516162 we always want to communicate with our parents and our staff to keep them in the loop of what were doing as part of an investigation and are cooperating with officials and other regulatory agencies
1516163 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
1516164 if its a multi party case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
1516165 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
1516166 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
1516167 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially

1516173 savannah wears her past like a fine old cape draped in southern graciousness pockets filled with treasures of a rich proud history
1516174 theres something magical about savannah centuries old oak trees typical of tropical climates line the sidewalks and create a canopy over the streets the houses or buildings in the historic district neatly adjoin one another many sit directly on the sidewalk some showcase a small potted garden on their front porch a way to add a splash of color a touch of individuality and to give the homeowner an excuse to linger on their stoop water plants and greet those who pass by
1516175 i think all of us at the college are elated that the county has acted to continue its investment in an institution thats serving more and more onondaga county residents and really having an impact on the economy in a positive way
1516176 the 2 separate water departments if you will the water board and the water authority operate very similar they have very similar operations i think much of the administration can be combined and i think in the long run we can save money for the county taxpayers
1516177 you can complain all you want about oil prices feed prices and everything else but in many cases its up to what you do with your land
1516178 it has mistakes in it it has layered background vocals of mine that just make an overall slop but its perfect slop
1516179 somebody asked me the other day what i thought of illegal downloading and i thought you know what i dont care because i think the majority doing it are kids and as they get old and get more income theyll probably buy records so its just making music a part of everyones lives

1516192 it is my belief that what lawanda jackson is most guilty of is being a pawn
1516193 she worked in a hospital system that did not provide strong enough deterrents to stop their employees from breaching their patients medical records which made it all the easier for the tabloids to financially induce her to invade my privacy
1516194 all employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1516195 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1516196 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organised these games will leave a fantastic legacy for china
1516197 this came very close to becoming a disaster the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1516198 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organisation will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity
1516199 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgement
1516200 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down

1516202 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1516203 he was a great man one of the few honest people of those times
1516204 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1516205 by his works and his entire life he innoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1516206 nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in ledgers home or his body
1516207 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1516208 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss my thoughts are with his family
1516209 everyone has been very eager to help saying what a great guy heath ledger was everyone except mary kate who has refused to speak
1516210 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1516211 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done it is the kind of information the private investigators are going to follow up
1516212 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1516213 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say i told her i thought she was cute and asked if she wanted a balloon she didnt i thought it a odd then i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddy but a longer name she could have said madeleine but i dont remember that

1516220 the dpj needs to act in a more responsible manner
1516221 under the weimer republic there were numerous instances of refusals to debate that made people think maybe we should give the nazis a try and we all know what that led to
1516222 from the soviet days the georgians always discriminated against us
1516223 then in the 1990s they opened their prisons and sent convicts police and soldiers to fight us but we drove them out now they seem ready to attack us again but were not scared there are no cowards here
1516224 russias initial aim was to retaliate over kosovo claiming independence and to stop georgia joining nato and when the west showed its incapacity to act russia saw the possibility finally to annex these territories and redraw the borders of eastern europe
1516225 but we wouldnt be alone it would be a war of the caucasian peoples against georgia and russia would be obliged to protect its citizens
1516226 at a local level georgians and south ossetians can get on and want to live their lives in peace
1516227 but as regards the military situation if tension continues to rise then there is the potential for a deterioration into some form of armed conflict
1516228 we dont want war but we wont give up one centimetre of our territory to anyone
1516229 theres no way back we were part of the ussr not georgia and now we want to rejoin our people
1516230 the olympics have a great significance for china and to the chinese people the games will make china more open
1516231 ive been a sports enthusiast since my childhood and we were all so excited back then that china was going to become part of the olympic family again it was one of the reasons i applied to go to the beijing academy of physical science
1516232 a person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae
1516233 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority
1516234 the moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them the state is denying the equality of all before the law
1516235 if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual
1516236 one must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it but are directed toward its healing the improvement of its condition of health or its individual survival
1516237 it is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as disposable biological material
1516238 certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities
1516239 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again
1516240 as of today we are at the stage of receiving orders from anywhere in the world
1516241 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone
1516242 i said get in the car buddy youre going home we forged a fast friendship
1516243 little did i know that 30 days later this dog was going to save my life
1516244 and he told me with his eyes dont be sad because i am going to see you again

1516248 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1516249 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1516250 aafia was tortured for five years until one day the us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1516251 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
1516252 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous
1516253 a great writer is so to speak a second government in his country
1516254 i also want to take this time to extend an olive branch to police chief keith mccaskill so we can sit at a table and talk about how we are going to reduce not only crime but the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
1516255 it looks like the winnipeg police service is acting like the top dog or the no 1 gang in the city of winnipeg
1516256 it is unacceptable for the police to have killed our youth
1516257 there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks out there that are willing to look in hindsight and find fault
1516258 you really have split seconds to make decisions with aggressive armed individuals
1516259 this is a very partisan issue before us its very serious and im taking it seriously ive got my papers in order

1516270 when the bobcats hired him it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better
1516271 hiring larry brown an elite coach you have to take notice of that
1516272 larry brown he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better
1516273 i think hes a perfect fit for us our team is young we are hard working and he can give us that discipline and those little insights to the game that will take us to the next level
1516274 hopefully in the back of my mind i wanted to be a bobcat
1516275 sometimes things dont work out the way you want them to in this case they did worrying about the contract negotiations and stuff that would have been just extra stress that i really didnt need to have
1516276 he might not have been nervous but im sure we were in a lot of ways
1516277 i was a college player so i knew i wasnt going to see the light of day
1516278 im just really looking forward to playing with larry and soaking up all he can offer
1516279 everytime i think of beltran all i think of his him taking a called third strike with the tying or winning runs on base
1516280 a huge thank you opeth will also appear in perth adelaide and sydney so if you want to see opeth make sure to get a hold of a ticket
1516281 it was shocking but good for the first couple of minutes i was in shock but it was a phone call i had been waiting for and then things just started happening iggor came to phoenix and i decided to invite him to make a record so that started everything and it was very cool
1516282 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational like between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq

1516296 you dont ever want to jeopardize their long term health youre talking about a 22 year old kid
1516297 dr andrews is a pretty renowned doctor so a lot of guys go see dr andrews and well see what comes of it

1516299 kembalikan ke taman lagi aja sudah sore takut kalau papa dan mamanya mencari
1516300 its the same problems hes been having so were going to take things slowly
1516301 i thought it was pretty loose and i was ready to go out there i did a little too much took a swing and i knew something was wrong im back to square one now
1516302 i think he told somebody that thats the best hes felt actually all year
1516303 some of thats up to him some of thats up to the rotation
1516304 right now we want to do no 1 whats best for him now and in the future
1516305 i faced the mets already and i threw pretty well against them
1516306 i know these phillies hitters im not going to change anything im going to keep doing what im doing and throwing the ball the way i can
1516307 ive just come over here and im trying to help these guys win games and hopefully help them get to the playoffs again
1516308 i had fun with those guys over there now im on this side im on this team im going to go out there contribute and do my job
1516309 theyve got a lot of young guys over here and they love to go out and play and they play hard
1516310 you can see it in their faces they want to go out and win again im just trying to get on the same boat that theyre on and help them win
1516311 the conversations have been ongoing so there werent really any surprises
1516312 the olympic experience for brett is going to be a great experience its a chance to represent your country and youre playing against the best national teams in the world certainly we would have liked to have gotten him into pro ball and gotten him some instruction but i dont think this is a setback in any way shape or form
1516313 it was definitely becoming confusing for our customers and customers were definitely looking at other vendors because they were much more articulate about what they were selling it has been a problem for us
1516314 nec is taking a proper approach because it is starting in small and medium business and looking more at service integration
1516315 the challenge here is that these customised approaches are usually for large and medium organisations because its much harder to have dedicated people providing services for small companies
1516316 the main question is how nec is going to deliver that
1516317 were going to go out there and throw and see how it goes
1516318 a lot of it is based on whats going on right now with the infield situation
1516319 mike adams has grown into a more integral part of our bullpen and its all about performance
1516320 hes thrown the ball great i think with him and heath and trevor you know youll see those guys a lot of times when we have a lead late in games performance has dictated that he pitch in the sixth maybe seventh inning if we have a lead
1516321 you know when to get ready and you kind of know situations that are coming up thats really the only big difference
1516322 when you have a role you know when to start getting loose and stuff like that as far as anything else pitching is pitching
1516323 you are thankful you put yourself in a situation where you have a defined role
1516324 as far as after that if you dont take pride in pitching whether it be the first or the ninth you probably shouldnt be pitching
1516325 ive never really been hurt before as far as keeping me out of the game this long
1516326 he had a good year going on too a real good year
1516327 im not willing to do that until the last day of the season
1516328 i want to pitch and whether this team is in a playoff race or not i want to be a part of this team thats why im here
1516329 thank god the dearborn ranch filed a extension for water rights and hope the city will come to its senses and stop listening to the hypnotic chant of the water rights consultant that advised lawton to give away water rights will mr doney stand up for water rights for economic development tomorrow or remain mute
1516330 i dont know anything about the logistics of this office but it seems kind of interesting that both oversights are related to the coal plant
1516331 were not bringing him up here to have him break down
1516332 well let him stay in the ballgame as long as he needs to be out there
1516333 i cant control what the manager and front office does when the phone rings im ready its not like ive never been in that position before
1516334 the main thing is to get c j healthy and ready to go we need him healthy
1516335 his first year as a full time closer theres a lot of pressure on him no doubt about it hes learning every time he goes out there and toes the rubber hell take his lumps but he learns from them
1516336 obviously when youre the closer the game is riding on your shoulders but the big thing is not to think too much we all know c j thinks too much ive told him that you need to go out there and trust your stuff and see what happens trust the strike zone
1516337 i dont know bro i wish i had an answer for you
1516338 the best i can tell you is i pound the strike zone i keep the ball down and for the most part i stay ahead of hitters im not afraid i know what ive got and i trust it
1516339 if you have no confidence throwing at 96 youll get pounded every time if youve got confidence throwing at 80 mph youre going to be fine
1516340 obviously we know c j has great stuff but i get tired talking about great arms i think c j i dont think he trusts his stuff hes got to quit thinking sometimes we are our own worst enemy i think hell be fine once he gets over the hump and once he gets healthy
1516341 he just needs to say heres 96 mph bro see if you can hit it
1516342 losses were affected by amortisation and while there was a small drop at the unwired level thats clearly not our interest thats part of the carry forward from the previous structure

1516346 barring protesters from carrying buckets of feces during the democratic national convention
1516347 no one would have expected that our national output will be collapsing when other countries like angola and saudi arabia as well as iraq are raising production to take advantage of strong oil prices and it is perhaps a reflection of our failure as a nation
1516348 what you saw driving the prices of oil was no longer the fundamentals of demand and supply there was enough supply but speculation came in
1516349 what we need to stay on schedule is cash flow

1516412 shareholders who voted the icahn slate before the agreement was announced could easily have been misled into thinking that having already voted for the icahn slate their vote was recorded as withheld in terms of the existing yahoo board
1516413 there were a flurry of proxy cards sent out to shareholders in the 10 days prior to the vote making the potential for confusion and error extremely high
1516414 had all yahoo shareholders had their intentions correctly represented some members of the board would have received less than 50 affirmative vote
1516415 yahoo owes it to shareholders to have these questions answered and answered quickly

1516426 access to pharmacists is the most valuable benefit when buying your medications in the united states
1516427 of the three medications they examined two of them were perfectly fine in terms of the active ingredient being 100 percent of what it should be
1516428 however the third one was an antibiotic and the active ingredient was only present at one tenth of the concentration it should have been if this were used to treat a critically ill patient the patient could have died
1516429 if you are taking several prescription drugs one can interact with the others
1516430 if you walk into a pharmacy and just buy one prescription alone then that pharmacist does not know what else you may be taking in mexico pharmacies typically do not have a pharmacist in the building it is a technician who knows the names of drugs their job is to sell they may know something about the drug but they dont have the depth of knowledge to understand drug interactions and side effects
1516431 effective communication in primary care must include skills that enhance the quality of care while helping patients and physicians use time wisely making the best use of available time is important for visits of any duration
1516432 relationship communication and efficiency in the medical encounter creating a clinical model from a literature review
1516433 lead to greater patient satisfaction better adherence to medical regimes increased self management better health outcomes lower costs and fewer malpractice claims these skills enable physicians to do it right the first time so they dont have to do it over
1516434 weve tried to propose a model of doctor patient communications
1516435 that is at the intersection between what patients need and the reality of a doctors world these are skills that make a difference and that doctors can use throughout their entire careers
1516436 students experience for themselves how specific communications skills help them avoid pitfalls in patient interactions and make better use of time
1516437 they see themselves becoming more effective and enjoy their work more

1516439 our goal is to reverse established type 1 diabetes not simply temporarily halt it or treat its symptoms
1516440 if we can introduce this inexpensive drug to the market it will be a tremendous achievement
1516441 it is shocking to see that scientists rather than evaluating something on its merits would spend so much time attacking the messenger
1516442 you have to wonder what is their real motivation you would think that scientists connected with the jdrf would be pursuing every effective cure not attacking approaches that rival their own
1516443 this is the very first step in what is likely to be a long process in achieving a cure we first need to determine whether the abnormal autoimmune cells that underlie type 1 diabetes can be knocked out with bcg vaccination as occurred in the mouse studies
1516444 our goal is to reverse established type 1 diabetes not simply temporarily halt it or treat its symptoms
1516445 if we can introduce this inexpensive drug to the market it will be a tremendous achievement
1516446 if there is any effect of glucose control using currently available drugs on heart attacks its going to be small and therefore the key message with heart attacks and strokes is that diabetes patients need comprehensive treatment to control all risk factors including blood pressure and cholesterol
1516447 the major clinical implication is that there is some risk associated with this level of intensification of glycemic control in high risk cardiovascular patients with type 2 diabetes similar to accord patients and that has to be considered by clinicians in the management of the disease
1516448 while we found that intensive treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes suggested some benefits from glucose control it did not reach significance for a reduction in the primary endpoint a composite of specified cardiovascular disease events in this population
1516449 hes quick and always a good player to have with the fact that they dont play the ball long

1516467 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1516468 my opponent doesnt want to drill in offshore oil reserves he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1516469 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1516470 also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1516471 more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1516478 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1516479 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1516480 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1516481 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1516482 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 u n security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1516483 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1516484 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1516485 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1516486 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1516487 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1516488 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1516489 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1516490 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1516491 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1516492 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1516493 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1516494 no hes not hes just pulling your leg and succeeding by the looks of it

1516523 foreclosure activity is closely tied to a decline in home values with todays depreciation an increasing number of homeowners find themselves owing more on a property than its market value setting the stage for default if there is mortgage payment shock a job loss or the owner needs to move

1516529 our house has been on the market for a year and traditional methods have not worked
1516530 we have had a signed contract with multiple buyers who later either were unable to get financing or got cold feet about the market this has been very frustrating
1516531 we are sick of the whole selling process and are ready to move on
1516532 the bid is not legally binding on either the buyer or the seller
1516533 the money they are willing to accept is wellbelow the market value
1516534 buyers are beginning to realize its an easy way to do business
1516535 it feels fair and equit able and like youre not being taken advantage of
1516536 getting a fair deal dictated by the reality of the marketplace
1516537 of what is owed on the mortgage almost unknown for the past two decades
1516538 they were being pushed off to one side and this big bank was coming in and being the seller
1516539 the lenders seem not prepared to act in a timely resolved and professional fashion on a short sale
1516540 they just dont get it that they have to get rid of this property that every day they have it costs them more money they are overloaded overburdened confused unable to deal
1516541 eleven years ago when i got my license we were in a market similar to now and short sales were more common
1516542 banks would preapprove them now its been so long that weve had such a good market banks are not set up to deal with them the longer were in this soft market banks will realize they have to step up to the plate
1516543 lenders and mortgage servicers consider short sales a necessary evil but it obviously involves a loss for them
1516544 we want to make sure the person isnt selling to someone they know
1516545 you have to watch to make sure the seller isnt cutting their brother in law a deal
1516546 if the bank has already incurred most of the expenses and is ready to foreclose anyway it will say were not going to save anything here with a
1516547 as a buyer i think you can get a fair price going with the asking price
1516548 bankers do not really want to have the property they want to have a fair price
1516549 a person in another state with paperwork 1 foot thick
1516550 there are so many houses for sale and its slowed so much that i think im safe purchasing something now
1516551 while i feel bad for the people who are losing their houses i also have to look out for no 1 and do what i have to do to find a place for myself and my son
1516552 the girls had been taught a few weeks ago yet they performed very professionally as though they had known the dance moves for months
1516553 several parents called me after the performance to congratulate the girls dancing
1516554 this investigation is still in its infancy and no charges have been laid but we are certainly investigating these allegations
1516555 we have been told by the police not to talk about this issue while inquiries are under way so nobody from our association is allowed to say anything
1516556 our membership now numbers about 300 and we are hopeful it will go still higher
1516557 we make a number of donations to the community throughout the year
1516558 this is the second time we have donated money to bruce street hall in the past four years
1516559 ive decided to show my support and take part in the service because this is a continuation of my familys journey
1516560 and its important that now we can hold our heads up high
1516561 but when we decided to speak out we became isolated really it was the worst time of our lives because nobody wanted to accept what was happening in the church
1516562 but now things are changing and i do believe this service is a positive thing
1516563 we must continue to gain a greater understanding of its causes and work to address them
1516564 we need to ensure that we commit significant resources to all aspects of this issue education and prevention as well as the provision of psychological emotional spiritual and practical support for those affected as a diocese we renew our commitment to do all we can to eradicate abuse
1516565 i hope that thursday evening like the recent papal apology will be a small but significant step in helping us to move forward as a church following jesus example in honouring the sacredness of children and working to ensure their safety
1516566 we wanted to hold the service now given the extensive coverage that sexual abuse in the catholic church has received in the lead up to and during last months world youth day week
1516567 we recognise that this issue is always painful for many within our community especially for those most directly affected this service is an opportunity to acknowledge that pain to strengthen our commitment to learn from and redress past wrongs and to continue to work towards a safe community for all
1516568 the service includes the opportunity for those gathered to bring forward either a symbol of personal significance to them or to carry an olive branch representing our need for healing and continued commitment to this issue
1516569 our experience shows that this issue demands that we work collaboratively beyond divisions of culture or belief i hope this is an opportunity for the whole community to stand in solidarity with all those who have been affected by abuse
1516570 its also an opportunity to express our support and desire for a church and society in which abuse must not be accepted
1516571 the idea started in the late 80s to create a recreational walking riding and jogging trail in east maitland that would link with maitland showground and eventually hopefully to morpeth
1516572 i was responsible for all the established parts of the link i planned them i designed them there is a continuous trail going down through shamrock lane up through a new development called the linkage
1516573 it is possible to ride a horse from the water tower on mount vincent road east maitland to freemans waterhole without getting off
1516574 although there was some resistance at first it is now used on a daily basis by people walking people with dogs
1516575 i dont know that that many people know the extent of the linkage that is there now
1516576 it is a unique facility that is not available in any other area that i am aware of
1516577 it passes through dedicated reserves and picks up new developments
1516578 its only there through the goodwill of developers who dedicated the land because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to create the linkage
1516579 its quite a good facility im very pleased the potential councillors are looking to see it upgraded and extended
1516580 the in and out tides cut the bank and were in the firing line because of where we are on the curve of the river
1516581 but when the wakeboarders were removed from the williams river they started coming here and you can see the erosion occurring
1516582 the boats create waves from 80cm to 1m high that undercut the bank
1516583 then when you do have rain or the river levels are high the land is already destabilised and it drops into the river
1516584 the cmas view is that the boat generated waves do cause undercutting
1516585 the cma will recommend to nsw maritime that a restriction be placed on slow tow activities in coast rivers until there is a solution to protect the riverbanks such as some sort of rock protection
1516586 but the issue is should the broader community be paying for the damage caused by a particular interest group
1516587 rock protection is very expensive and cannot be embarked on lightly
1516588 we received a number of submissions and the proposal has basically split the town in half
1516589 half the people want it because it will save them having to drive to maitland or kurri kurri to do their shopping and the other half are against it
1516590 most of the submissions against it were to do with traffic concerns
1516591 we will actually go back through a re notification process when alterations were made because there were so many objections based on traffic issues
1516592 the australian government recognises that it is important for students to learn in an environment that can provide them with up to date skills that readily transfer to the real world of work
1516593 the government is committed to improving the skills of australians to cope with the challenges of today and the changing workforce in the future
1516594 brett favre has retired and while retiring un retired but then he retired again
1516595 i think as a quarterback you are always having to go out there and earn the confidence of a coach that youre a leader
1516596 i have one year left and a chance to do something special
1516597 ben is certainly experienced but i dont know if he has ever been a leader
1516598 every coach has a different style on how they want you to lead
1516599 its good to sit down with the coach and hear what he wants you to do im excited about the chance to prove the type of leader i am
1516600 i have been playing offense my whole life im going to be happy wherever i play its football as long as i have the opportunity to be on field it doesnt matter where im going to play but they gave me the choice to play offense or defense and i chose offense
1516601 the bottom line is were a family but were all trying to get on the field
1516602 the running backs that get on the field are the ones who make the team better the only thing you can do is make sure you play harder than everyone else and were all going to try to do that if youre not doing that then youre not a college athlete
1516603 i went to the meeting with a case against the proposal at the meeting josie young allowed people to speak in favour of the da
1516604 when it came my turn to speak after three minutes i was told my time was running out
1516605 josie young i feel deliberately from the chair did not do her job then cr mccrudden launched into a personal attack that had nothing to do with the da
1516606 be counselled on the correct procedures to be followed in respect of allegations of improper conduct by staff members
1516607 i had every right to complain about the proposal and josie young did not step in
1516608 she claimed she was distracted by members of the public but even the gallery was saying take control of the meeting it went on for five minutes
1516609 people were astounded she had no control of that meeting
1516610 i thought it would be independently assessed by the conduct committee but the committee was the mayor russ pigg and bob proudfoot the other person supposedly on the committee is mccrudden himself
1516611 i am seeking a truly independent assessment of this id like to know the answer to a few questions like how can the conduct committee be considered independent
1516612 the system is not transparent and not democratic and the outcome is a symptom of the malaise this council has got
1516613 we will be recommending the company be liquidated and if it is i am going to pursue him for it
1516614 once the company is in liquidation we have more powers that enable us to pursue various avenues that could mean we overturn mr carsons forgiven debts
1516615 recent suggestions that he is in debt to the beechwood group are false and mr carson will welcome the opportunity to speak with any liquidator of beechwood homes an opportunity that to date he has not been afforded by the administrators
1516616 such a meeting will dismiss the need for any further harmful speculation
1516617 there are 8 700 more that need to be checked
1516618 when the last one is checked and each one gets his or her answer then we can say it is over
1516619 it would be a wonderful thing if it could happen
1516620 i havent really had a look at it but ill be studying it up a bit before i get to vote
1516621 id like to have my say but i dont know if it would be a good one
1516622 some probably think its a hassle while others are really into it
1516623 i was on the road on the way to port kembla when i got the call from kellie
1516624 she told me the house was on fire and was burning to the ground i asked her if she had called her mum and she said no so i pulled over and rang kerry
1516625 we met in port kembla and drove home together it was well after midnight when we got back and we were up all night
1516626 everything is gone were picking through the photos the ground is covered in them some of them are only partially burned
1516627 the whole lot is gone the house is totally gutted if its not fire damaged its water damaged everything that survived has to be thrown away
1516628 some of the kids were just starting to move out of home but they all had a lot of gear in there
1516629 ryan lost everything i had whatever was in my truck
1516630 because we have a horse and a dog were looking for somewhere suitable
1516631 the princes highway remains an extreme infrastructure bottleneck and is an impediment to economic and social growth in the region
1516632 we will continue to assist the national parks and wildlife service in the regional park and the department of lands in their crown lands
1516633 we have been reluctant to reverse 15 years of unqualified support for rehabilitation of the bushland
1516634 but we would have to be hypocritical to help council fix up the land it is offering for a road that would have a serious impact on an area we have worked so hard to protect and restore for so many years
1516635 now that the truth is out about the condition of councils land the government would have to have rocks in their head to accept it in return for a road that will seriously degrade the values of the regional park and set a serious precedent for future park revocations
1516636 after all it is not as if the link road has anything to do with solving current traffic problems
1516637 mr watson publicly revealed two years ago that the road was about helping open up north nowra to more urban development obviously this would contribute to more traffic congestion rather than alleviate the present problems
1516638 a third bridge across the river adjacent to the present two is the only answer to freeing up congestion at the illaroo road and bolong road intersections
1516639 we dont need to make people scream and shout well just keep on going
1516640 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1516641 lets see if this makes the national news i doubt it
1516642 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1516643 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1516644 mccain campaign boots black reporter from campaign event other reporters left alone
1516645 the good versus evil black and white typical for coverage of bosnia and the balkans in general
1516646 part of the planning process is to understand what you need how much land you have and what its use is and what you may need
1516647 we dont understand how a trained police officer such as chavalia could get away with shooting an innocent woman and shooting an innocent baby
1516648 we are not asking for new money it will be a dollar for dollar trade
1516649 our attorney thought we were in good shape from a legal standpoint
1516650 we are simply trying to do what residents told us they wanted all along
1516651 allen county is proud to once again host a republican presidential candidate the county has a long history going back to dwight david eisenhower
1516652 john mccain looks forward to interaction with voters and the town hall format is the best way to do so
1516653 he looks forward to engaging voters on his plans to create jobs in ohio and provide relief for the price of gas at the pump
1516654 john mccain has always and will always put his countrys interests before any party any special interest and even his own self interest
1516655 john mccain will do what is right for our country the american people will always know exactly where john mccain stands
1516656 there is no amount of money that can match the life of tarika wilson and what she meant to her children is the reason why we didnt put an amount in to put an amount in would really shame her memory
1516657 they should have never gone into that home when they did
1516658 that night it was my daughter it could be somebody else
1516659 you can save more water by not eating one pound of meat than you can by not showering for six months
1516660 m2af everybody go to loginxbox tk i just got 1600 ms points hurry though i think it is a limited time offer
1516661 with everything going on i just wanted to come out here and volunteer
1516662 its like a block party on a large scale all the law enforcement need to know were here were taking our streets back our neighborhoods own them the bad guys can go somewhere else
1516663 the vast majority of those polled said religion or their faith in god plays an important role in helping them through financial straits
1516664 i baruch have just had the worst 2 days of my investment career
1516665 if a major earthquake were to flatten the inland empire not only would it be a human tragedy but i doubt anyone would want to rebuild a large number of the houses what is a bad situation there for fannie could turn suddenly diabolical warren buffett once said that he thought fannie mae had more super catastrophe risk than berkshire
1516666 to me sam walton was one of the great value investors his only investment was
1516667 its extremely difficult to get to the earnings per share number of 2004 anytime soon
1516668 the auctions give a sense that most of the time most things will sell if people thought they couldnt resell or that if they died their heirs couldnt sell many wouldnt buy a thing
1516669 auch wenn die geschworenen nicht zu unseren gunsten entschieden haben sind wir weiterhin der ansicht dass die atp dem hamburger turnier den masters status zu unrecht entzogen hat und wir diese entscheidung zurecht angefochten haben
1516670 das traditionsturnier am hamburger rothenbaum war schon immer ein turnier der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser statuts jedes jahr erneuert werden
1516671 thats why brands like louis vuitton and apple dont do it
1516672 doesnt make sense if it costs 20 rupees to collect 25 rupees
1516673 its all about reach and cost and operational reasons make it difficult to reach these people
1516674 the carriers could be the mfis but you dont want to take away from the mfis
1516675 they serve the customers and theyre part of the last mile to the customer they offer services beyond transactions theyre underwriting loans and coaching customers having the mfi play an active role with the poorest people is great because theyre not comfortable with credit and savings the mfis make the approach to the poorest people that much better and it helps them understand how to use this powerful new tool
1516676 with him being an ex norwich player i shouted see you later bellamy and he just turned around and swore at me and he said something about prostitutes in ipswich
1516677 kind of sheep like youve all been conditioned to think and act like sheep
1516678 you are enslaved but you dont know it you dont want to admit it because youre walking around free eating good dinners as long as youre comfortable youre controllable
1516679 so stable and robust so taken for granted that it no longer requires active high level management
1516680 weve outgrown the area everything is so old and small here it cant keep up with us
1516681 this is not redevelopment as such the hope is that there will be revitalization a mix of businesses pedestrian and bike friendly and something that has some character
1516682 we have some businesses that have been there 50 years
1516683 but you look at things and think we have to brighten this up make it more vibrant for the neighborhood and community
1516684 people will wait 30 or 45 minutes to get in in the summer but they wont wait in the wintertime when its 10 below zero and theres no place to park
1516685 its been a good location and weve been a destination for people
1516686 i would like to stay in the neighborhood because people know where to find us but having our own building would be advantageous
1516687 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
1516688 we have cast the golfs core components in a precise new mold
1516689 the golf is the global icon car making so the architecture and graphic form of new model are also absolutely clear and unique
1516690 it is more accentuated more three dimensional than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
1516691 on september 25th i will turn 40 on may 25th i launched this site because it was exactly 4 months from my birthday ive decided the most impactful thing i could do the thing that would truly make a difference and bring me the most joy in celebrating my birthday would be to
1516692 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1516693 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1516694 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1516695 if they are doing this here what can we expect in beijing
1516696 at that time of course we werent nearly as awash in commercialism as we are now
1516697 but one of the announcers was discussing the fact that one of the athletes had a huge endorsement deal in place before theyd even won a single medal those comments sort of stoked a small smoldering flame that had been in the back of my mind for a year or so within a day or two i had fleshed out the concepts surrounding booster gold
1516698 i think of him as an unlikely candidate to have inherited the responsibilities that now weigh him down
1516699 but thats part of the fun here this isnt a situation he sought out booster as time cop will continue to be a very important part of the book of course that gives us a chance to visit any number of fun eras within dcs past and i love the idea that booster has become highly competent though no one in the dcu knows it except for batman the fact that hes considered a lightweight failure is fun mix that in with his personality which allows us to bring lots of fun and humor into the book and i think it makes for a great combination
1516700 if people saw the last page of booster gold 1 000 000 they saw brainiac 5 cyborg superman elongated man batgirl and robin id say thats a pretty good teaser
1516701 that was something geoff told me months ago so i believe he and jeff had the idea
1516702 we will continue to develop that storyline but in a very sneaky way
1516703 its a matter of the economy going through a major change
1516704 companies arent hitting the growth numbers they expected many of them had geared up and were investing in expansions but this slowdown has derailed those plans
1516705 you always need to manage the bottom line to deliver the best possible returns to shareholders but in some cases now this is about survival companies are going to go out of business
1516706 companies are doing more complex analyses around product and customer profitability when you have limited resources its critical to focus on your most important customers and products you end up asking whether you can afford to keep working with every client some you may have to walk away from if theyre not profitable
1516707 reassure them that youre coming back at the end of the day thats the big thing
1516708 have them on a schedule and teach them to wait and stay where theyre told to stay
1516709 we encourage our parents to sit down with their kids 10 minutes a day and let the kids color have them learn their address and phone number and practice writing their names
1516710 make sure conversation about school is there on a daily basis
1516711 they can maybe connect up with other children in class so they can get familiar with them they might also help shop for school supplies
1516712 a lot of teachers are in their classrooms getting the rooms set up the week before school
1516713 we want parents to feel comfortable but sometimes lingering makes it harder
1516714 some of them will walk right into that class and not look back
1516715 its nice if parents write little notes like mommy loves you with a happy face and put them in their lunch box
1516716 to me it looks like coconut gelato but maybe i just subconsciously really want some coconut gelato and im like staring at the picture forcing it to be coconut gelato just to appease myself
1516717 it pushes heavy stuff around all day long just like joe
1516718 coming in as a rookie i wanted to have a hall of fame career
1516719 thats the goal you want to be the best of the best if you dont youre not working hard enough
1516720 we put him on their best defensive player every game and he gave up one sack
1516721 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
1516722 the late late radio show with tom snyder amp steve mason
1516723 from the northwest side filled up with middle class white riders near the far end of the line leaving no room for poorer people trying to board on inner city platforms
1516724 lo que s podemos hacer y estamos en consulta en di logo en conversaci n con el gobierno de colombia es asegurar que el gobierno m o no va a pedir extradici n de ninguna persona si la ley de e u no permite una pena m nima de equis a os
1516725 el pr ximo paso que queremos dar en materia de extradici n es examinar con los norteamericanos como el mayor pa s requirente que en cualquier negociaci n que se lleve a cabo en los estados unidos con los narcotraficantes extraditados por lo menos les impongan una pena m nima severa
1516726 les sugiero que de los tres casos ya resueltos de los 15 paramilitares extraditados hace un par de meses la pena m nima acordada fue algo entre 17 y 18 a os puede ser que eso es buen indicador para el futuro pero depende de las conversaciones bilaterales
1516727 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1516728 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1516729 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1516730 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1516731 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1516732 which is why i personally sponsored black hat at the platinum level ever since because i think we had some atonement to do
1516733 all of a sudden this year a lot of stuff has been breaking loose
1516734 owning the windows pc is not really a priority anymore
1516735 yes big time actually i think theres more talk now about doing a theatrical film than there ever has been
1516736 now that theyve seen what we can do basically we had a normal pattern budget on
1516737 the strike gave us the gap that weve always talked about having and thats how we were able to do the prequel
1516738 i personally dont think that can happen as long as were doing the television show not with the same people and thats been the biggest problem we do want to use the same people we want the same people to be involved including the writers obviously theyve got it the hardest because they finish one year and then theyre writing the next theyre talking season 8 ideas already
1516739 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1516742 my friends and i were going to a concert in utah the driver missed a turn on i 80
1516743 it didnt sound right to me so i settled on jack its an older more traditional kind of name
1516744 right now were in the bonding stage were still learning about each other
1516745 his personality is very unique hes very patient one of the most patient animals ive been around
1516746 he allows me to put his collar around him im kind of slow and he just waits there
1516747 one of the big jobs these days is breaking down social barriers
1516748 its like a teenager who basically said i used to be the kid in a wheelchair
1516749 he can take my wallet off of my lap and give it to the store clerk to pay for things
1516750 i like to help people out in general people with disabilities for sure
1516751 theres probably a few guys on the team who felt that way that they are not performing the way they know they can
1516752 hopefully i can look back when the season is over and realize it was a bad spell
1516753 i cant pinpoint a specific time it started to hurt
1516754 it was just a soreness and when i would get loose it would go away but id still think about it id wonder if it was going to flare up
1516755 not if the right wing republicans have anything to say about it
1516756 i dont believe thats true do you really believe that
1516757 were doing this on a small scale basis to see how much interest there is out there from airlines
1516758 we want to see how much a slot is worth
1516759 i want to make it very clear that the dot and the faa can do whatever they want but theyre not going to get access to ground facilities at my airports

1516761 its one thing to say something its another thing to prove it and measure your assertions
1516762 its a new field theres never a completely perfect inventory
1516763 we think its done very well and the numbers are as real as they can be with the available data theyre headed in the right direction
1516764 i am sad to report that my familys little store has come under attack by the california pharmacy board
1516765 moderator wanted you to know that they posted your personal information on com
1516766 yeah i dont care if the car companies buy it from me whatever
1516767 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
1516768 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
1516769 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
1516770 ive been arguing pluto for eight years so its another occasion where im arguing pluto this one happens to be a little more formal in its construct so i see it as another day of just trying to tell people teach people about what we now know about the solar system

1516921 a person of interest is not an official designation it is abused law enforcement is politics those in power use the term to assure the public that theyre doing something police authorities fear admitting that they literally have no clue who committed a crime
1516922 unfortunately these politicians trash lives along the way the person of interest is someone against whom there is no real evidence but someone who can be at least for a time used vilified scapegoated its time our law enforcement politicians learn to say no comment and for them to educate the public that very often especially at the beginning of a case police have no idea who the perpetrator was or at least no real evidence the public should want responsible action and restraint not simply action the media should also cease its complicity in this charade and rigorously question politicians who finger someone as a person of interest asking what evidence the police have to support their grave allegation otherwise naming someone a person of interest cheaply serves many of the same cynical purposes that show trials serve in totalitarian regimes
1516923 the person of interest phenomenon is something like the opposite side of the coin from terrorist watch lists in the name of improving public safety government authorities want to create some status for suspicious seeming individuals that would enlarge governments investigative power without triggering the civil liberties protections that go with identifying anyone as an actual criminal suspect so far it is not at all clear how much safety the public is getting out of the shift to a preventive law enforcement mentality there is a substantial risk that we will wind up less free but actually no safer

1517194 it is a very important event a major event for our country im always aware of that its scorching im trying to make sure that things are fair but thats only part of it its also got to be perceived as fair its tough work but its exhilarating as well
1517195 increasingly i found myself spending time with people of means law firm partners and investment bankers hedge fund managers and venture capitalists as a rule they were smart interesting people knowledgeable about public policy liberal in their politics expecting nothing more than a hearing of their opinions in exchange for their checks
1517196 i was candid i had no problem telling well heeled supporters that the tax cuts theyd received from george bush should be reversed
1517197 my own worldview and theirs corresponded in many ways i had gone to the same schools after all had read the same books and worried about my kids in many of the same ways
1517198 i know as a consequence of my fund raising i became more like the wealthy donors i met in the very particular sense that i spent more and more of my time above the fray outside the world of immediate hunger disappointment fear irrationality and frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population
1517199 i feel like a slice of butter melting over a big ole pile of flapjacks yeah
1517200 produces computationally derived paths from data in such a way that allows them to be re followed through the actual world
1517201 the tool would add a new layer of agency to this emerging virtual geography that would allow segments of global society that are usually outside of this emerging grid of hyper geo mapping power to gain quick and simple access with to gps system
1517202 locative media emerged over the last half decade 2000 2005 as a response to the decorporealized screen based experience of net art claiming the world beyond either gallery or computer screen as its territory
1517203 weve met with them numerous times volunteered with them and gotten feedback on the project and incorporated it into our plans
1517204 they dont want the maps to be totally public because in this netwar condition in the borderlands there are lots of parties who would use that information to disrupt the aid efforts such as the border patrol the minutemen and other anti immigrant vigilante hate groups like them
1517205 at the end of the day the goal is that we will not control or even have access to any of the activist geolocative information at all
1517206 our role is to make tools by listening to the users such that they can deploy the system and control data as they see fit
1517207 all the immigrants that would participate would in a sense participate in a large landscape of aesthetic vision

1517216 i wonder if i could make a cherry vanilla cupcake
1517217 i have lost all hope and am not keen on taking the fight to the supreme court i have lost strength but i know i must accept what god has in store for me
1517218 i have to be a mother now and i am not running away from it my baby despite its ailment is now the joy i look forward to
1517219 it may take some time by which my pregnancy would have progressed and i wonder if it would then be prudent to go for abortion
1517220 i am feeling low i dont feel like eating or doing much but i know i have to i have to give birth so i have to take care of myself
1517221 it is some time next week but i must immediately visit a physician because i feel nauseated and as if my blood pressure has gone up we will visit the doctor across the road when haresh returns home from work

1517224 ainda est fresca em minha mem ria aquela fria tarde de dezembro
1517225 it is an incredible organisation and before i was diagnosed with cancer i didnt realise just how much the cancer council does
1517226 its fantastic to see such an enthusiastic group of young supporters at tigs getting behind this event
1517227 they offered me counselling and phone support as well as providing me with lots of information and individual help taking me to the hospital the times my family could not
1517228 every country will have skeletons in the closet but beijing is a totally different regime its a communist regime
1517229 i think the international olympic committee should not give it to cities like beijing because they do themselves a great disservice and they destroy the goodwill that people have for the olympic games
1517230 all the pressure is probably detrimental to athletes ability to perform because it is very emotional
1517231 i know that she could buy a refrigerator that would be four times more efficient
1517232 has the ability to really help carry that experience to other cities in minnesota
1517233 what weve found historically is that if a whole community has a drive toward energy efficiency you get better results
1517234 it isnt so much about thinking of something new that nobodys ever done before but really getting the widespread adoptions of the tried and true technologies
1517235 es grave que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores
1517236 en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1517237 permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y oportuno acceso a las noticias m s importantes
1517238 espero que el tsj decida antes del cierre de las postulaciones
1517239 teniendo en cuenta las actuales condiciones y el equipo de nuestras tropas en caso de invasi n del enemigo extranjero podremos bloquear desahogadamente y en per odo indefinido el estrecho de ormuz
1517240 creo en la conciencia del pueblo boliviano y mi pedido a estos sectores como discapacitados y algunos sectores de la central obrera boliviana es que no sean instrumentos de la derecha no sean instrumentos de los vende patrias y no sean instrumentos de los neoliberales porque no van a confundir

1517246 hes really sore but hes doing better hes hoping to be out of the hospital by thursday
1517247 i have been an air traffic controller for almost 20 years
1517248 the failures of the faa over the course of my career and before have been well documented
1517249 the faa has made it clear that they want the senior controllers gone and they want it done yesterday
1517250 it is clear to us that we are not welcome in their future plans

1517255 youve got to read my article to get to the discussion
1517256 how i want you to perceive what im doing right now
1517257 this is the first officially licensed little league game for these platforms and the controls have been masterfully crafted for accessibility
1517258 this is a game that can be enjoyed by the entire family
1517259 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1517260 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1517261 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1517262 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1517263 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1517264 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1517265 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1517266 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1517267 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1517268 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1517269 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1517270 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1517271 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1517272 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1517273 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1517274 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1517275 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1517276 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1517277 we are operating business as usual at walk am and fm stations there is no change in our day to day operations while we are in the aloha trust we will continue to stay focused on the task at hand which remains as always to super serve our listeners clients and employees
1517278 when you want a cop or ambulance you want a cop or ambulance
1517279 when we shot the scene there were like 60 crewmen sitting around eating salami sandwiches
1517280 its really the least sexy thing you can ever imagine

1517293 nominations will remain open until midday on wednesday august 13 which is also known as momination day
1517294 the nomination process is one of the most important phases of the electoral cycle
1517295 this is when the community learns exactly who will stand to represent them on their local council
1517296 in the afternoon of wednesday august 13 each of the 90 returning officers across the state will conduct the all important draw to determine the order in which candidates names appear on the ballot paper
1517297 all candidates must ensure that their nominators are enrolled for the council area or ward in which they are standing and nominators should check their own enrolment status
1517298 we suggest that candidates are proposed by more than two nominators in case some nominators are not correctly enrolled
1517299 its an easy gift to give and they need lots of it
1517300 it went about 200 per cent better than we thought it would
1517301 its a fabulous result that is far in excess of what wed expected
1517302 obviously a lot of people will be able to be helped by that
1517303 we had people ring us and say how they enjoyed the night
1517304 andrew okeefe performed well and brian olsen our guest auctioneer for the night did a good job
1517305 wed just like to thank all the companies and people who donated to the auction and also the people who contributed to the night but couldnt be there
1517306 we had a lot of people donate who just couldnt come for the night so they donated money and things like that
1517307 a lot of people too many to mention have helped we were thrilled
1517308 wed really just like to thank everybody who came because theyre the ones who made it happen
1517309 this was definitely the most unusual festival ive been to down here
1517310 ive got a feeling its only going to get bigger
1517311 if they come back next year i dont see a reason why we wouldnt have it again because it was a big success this year
1517312 government agencies including the ministry of health and the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine have reached consensus on the issue
1517313 the restrictions contribute to the stigmatization of people with hiv
1517314 at that time the government thought the restriction would keep the virus outside the county

1517316 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle
1517317 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1517318 en lo particular no me gusta que convoquen jugadores que no son mexicanos por nacimiento
1517319 no puedo platicar de mi etapa como t cnico porque fue muy mala pero sigo pensando de la misma manera
1517320 estamos bien en el nimo fue un golpe duro dif cil pero ya pas el equipo siempre tiene personalidad para salir de sta hay que darle la vuelta a la p gina y corregir las cosas que estamos haciendo mal
1517321 hay que seguir trabajando m s duro ahora lo m s imporante es que nos mantenemos unidos y se ha visto que siempre en las adversidades el equipo ha sabido salir adelante
1517322 me preocupa respecto a los primeros dos partidos del torneo porque no le hemos podido dar seguridad al equipo para ir al frente para atacar como lo hac a hab amos recibidos tres goles en dos partidos y eso es para analizarlo despu s lo del barcelona hay que analizar no hemos visto el partido y hay que aprender de esto y creo que tuvimos fallas en conceptos donde no podemos fallar son cosas que nos vienen ense ando desde j venes y eso lo tenemos que afrontar y mejorar
1517323 hemos fallado muchos pases pases sencillos vimos el partido contra barcelona y hay que aprenderles a ellos que no salen de una l nea no quiero profundizar porque parecer a t cnico pero son cosas que hay que aprenderles sabemos que es uno de los equipos grandes del mundo y no nos queda m s que callarnos y aprender
1517324 nos preocupa todo los cinco al final son goles lo que digo es la forma el sistema que nosotros manejamos es lo que hemos dejado de hacer el concretar pases nos da mucha tranquilidad y tenemos que mejorar porque es el a b c y lo tenemos que hacer bien
1517325 en s hubo dos movimientos tambi n michel cuenta con la comunicaci n no quiero decir que checo rodr guez no hable pero nos conoc amos de alguna manera nuestra deficiencias nuestras virtudes y lo que tenemos que reconocer que no hemos estado tan seguros y tenemos que mejorar est claro para eso tenemos este primer partido en casa
1517326 tanto en la pretemporada como en estas dos jornadas que han transcurrido el balance es positivo al analizar lo que nos paso contra el toluca estamos conscientes de que no nos tiene que volver a pasar una desconcentraci n como esa en los diez primeros minutos porque si vemos lo que pas despu s el juego fue muy parejo y en la segunda parte el equipo tuvo reacci n y no dej pasar al rival de la media cancha aunque despu s tuvimos para empatar hay que reconocer que toluca hizo un gran planteamniento para ganarnos bien y sobre todo que hern n cristante portero de los diablos rojos respondi muy bien
1517327 las conclusiones son un poco raras en este inicio de torneo creo que la verdadera identidad del equipo y que todos queremos ver fue con la que se jug contra santos sin embargo a n faltan detalles por mejorar para no vernos afectados de desconcentraci n como lo fue esta vez
1517328 es normal que se piense en una cierta preocupaci n por los cuatro goles que hemos recibido en apenas dos jornadas pero cuando se hace un buen trabajo defensivo o de ataque se generaliza todo el grupo as que esta vez todos somos part cipes de esta situaci n en cuanto a las ausencias obviamente que no nos gustar a que nadie se lesione y sobre todo como le paso a rojas quien estaba haciendo un buen trabajo y fue llamado a la selecci n pero tambi n debemos estar tranquilos porque aqu hay jugadores de gran calidad que pueden remplazar a jugadores importantes
1517329 sin duda que el partido ser muy duro porque durante nuestra preparaci n tuvimos la oportunidad de enfrentarnos y vimos que es un rival muy dif cil pero sin demeritarlo creo que este fin de semana que jugemos de local no tendremos demasiadas complicaciones para quedarnos con el triunfo en casa creo que s lo falta mejora como vistante
1517330 todos somos responsables de los goles a favor o en contra
1517331 tengo la experiencia suficiente y s que comet un error al precipitarme en una jugada que fue muy r pida que si se analiza en c mara lenta se puede presenciar que no fui con alguna mala intenci n sobre rios daniel s lo quise terminar la jugada y que no avanzara el ataque del rival sin embargo el rbitro la considero de roja en un momento clave para nosotros ya que durante la segunda parte estuvimos encima y obviamente contra con un hombre m s hubieramos rescatado un mejor resultado
1517332 obviamente que estas bajas pueden pesar pero este equipo est compuesto por varios jugadores de gran calidad que pueden hacer un gran trabajo para suplir a oscar y sobre todo a m que hay m s variantes pero lo que puedo asegura es que el que juegue lo har de la mejor manera
1517333 hay que recordar que este deporte es de equipo y aqu todos somos culpables y responsables tanto en los goles a favor o en los cuatro que llevamos en contra
1517334 es lamentable que en tan poco tiempo que tengo en este pa s he recibido mi segunda roja pues la verdad es que nunca he sido una persona agresiva y mucho menos de recibir muchas expulsiones el hecho est en que en 2005 cuendo ten a seis a os en primera divison me mostaron mi primera tarjeta roja
1517335 durante estos dos partidos me ha costado un poco tener un buen ritmo pues debo reconocer que a n no me siento a un gran nivel que ten a en el atlas sin embargo estoy trabajando fuerte para ponerme al cien por ciento lo antes posible y como consecuencia ser tomado en cuenta por el t cnico
1517336 we have enjoyed great sales success with dell 1320c which was launched last year

1517338 rfid offers adopters of the technology a number of benefits from improvements in manufacturing inventory and distribution processes to reduced costs for product theft spoilage or obsolescence
1517339 its incumbent on our industry with help from organizations such as comptia to help customers overcome any obstacles to rfid usage and help them benefit from the efficiencies rfid can deliver
1517340 con la lesi n de marioni hay dos escenarios uno un manejo conservador en base a un trabajo f sico diferenciado y una rehabilitaci n intensiva si lo queremos llamar as por parte del fisioterapeuta carlos cocaro y la otra es un tratamiento definitivo que terminar a en una cirug a
1517341 estamos a petici n del jugador y reuniendo elementos con la directiva y con el cuerpo t cnico consideramos que en un par de semanas con un trabajo f sico intenso puede beneficiar al jugador con una mejor a y que pueda el encontrar su rendimiento ptimo para los siguientes compromisos esto ser a de la siguiente manera estar a fuera de completo entrenamiento con el equipo dos semanas estar a a doble o triple sesi n si es necesario para combatir esa pubalgia y la tercera semana comenzar a a entrenar con el equipo es decir se perder a dos partidos y estar a para el tercero a partir de esta fecha
1517342 es un tema muy aparte porque yo ya habl al respecto de eso pero ya lleg un t cnico que viene de europa sven g ran eriksson tiene otra mentalidad esperemos que los que est n ah hay que apoyarlos y que sean mejores que los mexicanos eso es lo que uno pide nada m s
1517343 yo siempre estoy en contra de eso jugadores naturalizados en el tri pero bueno as es ahora la selecci n y esperemos que le vaya muy bien
1517344 viene un entrenador de europa y ellos traen otra mentalidad esperemos que todo salga bien y que a la selecci n le vaya bien que es lo que uno como mexicano quiere
1517345 no quiero ahondar mucho en el tema yo ya ahond y dije muchas cosas yo ten a un compa ero aqu que era guille guillermo franco entonces ya no quiero ahondar tanto en ese tema vamos apoyar a la selecci n a morir y ojal que le vaya bien
1517346 nosotros tenemos la idea de quedar campeones esa es la idea esa es la meta que todos nos trazamos en este nueva temporada vamos paso a paso y esperemos hacerlo bien y tratar de que el equipo monterrey vaya mejorando poco a poco
1517347 l lo arm ricardo la volpe al equipo ahora tiene m s pues como quien dice ya nos conoce m s y ya sabe lo que podemos dar no hay pretextos para hacer una mala temporada no tenemos ning n pretexto entonces tenemos que salir con todo
1517348 no rindes igual el calor es insoportable es algo muy inhumano jugar a esa hora entonces esperemos que se pueda hacer algo y si no adaptarnos lo m s r pido posible tambi n nosotros sabiendo que eso puede ser tambi n una ventaja para monterrey el calor
1517349 tenemos que ir a ganar all contra chivas creo que tambi n es un equipo de mucha tradici n en m xico pero monterrey va de menos a m s ya se le gan all y le podemos volver a ganar
1517350 campeonitis es ya no trabajar es echarte a la hamaca es ya no tener ambiciones
1517351 si me explican qu es la campeonitis te puedo decir si nos est afectando o no
1517352 la campeonitis es como nos ven los medios si pueden ver los entrenamientos desde que llegamos han sido con mayor intensidad para m campeonitis es ya no trabajar es echarte a la hamaca es ya no tener ambiciones y la verdad te digo que la gente que piensa eso est muy equivocada hay que ver el funcionamiento del equipo c mo juega c mo tiene llegada y aunque no la meta no significa que tengamos campeonitis es simplemente que no metemos la pelota al arco
1517353 creo que estamos pasando por un momento donde un error m nimo se convierte en un acierto del rival como pas con pumas desafortunadamente no hemos podido anotar pero eso tiene correcci n tarde o temprano van a caer por racimos los goles y lo que antes eran jugadas en nuestra contra podremos aprovecharlas a nuestro favor
1517354 obviamente uno quisiera trabajar con todo el plantel completo pero dadas las circunstancias me motivan a seguir trabajando con la gente que se qued y con los chavos de la primera divisi n a en caso de no contar con los titulares en alguna emergencia quiero ver qui n re ne el perfil para el d a de ma ana ser tomado en cuenta
1517355 ben tez est teniendo una evoluci n satisfactoria de su esguince de rodilla en la semana verificaremos si puede estar para este domingo o para el siguiente fin de semana ser a prematuro darlo de alta en este momento
1517356 hay un buen ambiente estamos convencidos que el equipo est haciendo las cosas bien en monterrey mis jugadores hicieron un buen partido no lo reflejamos en el marcador y esto es as
1517357 nosotros necesitamos empezar a anotar a ganar para sumar porque si no hay gol no ganamos
1517358 ojal que podamos anotar un gol r pido para que no se encierre la afici n est metida con nosotros espero que vaya y nos apoye igual que no se desespere porque vamos por buen camino
1517359 desesperado no impaciente s sabemos que se va a resolver en esta semana aportar lo m o al equipo o al grupo
1517360 and looking at the mirror and feeling pretty disgusted with what he sees
1517361 he did have somewhat of a routine that he would go through to carry out this crime
1517362 sadly youre going to have people that try to cheat that are going to try to steal that are trying to make a quick buck the wrong way
1517363 its up to us to never never like it accept it or tolerate it
1517364 he found a way to get into the courtesy collection box
1517365 he would take that money out and keep that money for his own gain
1517366 if not now when it s only going to get worse as will the pain

1517368 is it neat or is it slightly odd that in this los angeles community called pasadena a suburban mix of nice restaurants and well tended front lawns there is a home wedged in with the other houses where the entire front yard is edible
1517369 suburbia occupies vast swaths of former prime u s farmland nasas ecological forecasting research group reports that the people living there already water about 30 million acres of lawn three times the land planted in irrigated corn
1517370 i obviously didnt like the way i finished the event last week but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and mattered
1517371 i needed to feel the pressure and i needed to play well on a tough golf course heading into this week so i take a lot of positives out of last week
1517372 i had a good week last week with the short game but it wasnt great
1517373 right now my season with just a couple wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1517374 the ninth hole is kind of like a short par 4 really
1517375 i hit a 3 wood in there tuesday youve got 17 and that was a 5 wood today
1517376 the greens are pretty severe a lot of slopes big slopes and big humps right in the middle of the greens
1517377 so when youre using that much club going into a green that can be quite tricky because if you just get on the wrong side of a slope its no guaranteed two putt
1517378 there are not going to be a lot of 2s on any of those par 3s
1517379 whats interesting to me is that this exact study was done in 1988 and given to the usga it was disregarded now 20 years later its considered valid
1517380 its going to help all the guys who drive the ball better
1517381 the premium will be to hit the fairway off the tee so you can spin the ball better on the shots into the greens
1517382 i remember in high school and college when i used to hit 8 irons that would fly 210 yards out of the rough
1517383 it will be funny watching when the new rules begin the people sitting behind the greens had better wear hard hats
1517384 they will have to think before they stand up there and try to bomb it 350 off the tee
1517385 it was the toughest loss by far i had ever suffered as a coach in 31 years
1517386 we just want to get the season underway and bounce back from that
1517387 if there was a big moment in the game they found a way to elevate their play and take advantage of the situation i look at this years team and see a lot of the same things
1517388 therere no easy games in our conference no off weeks
1517389 the style of offense they present is very hard to defend
1517390 you just have to have solid game plan and it comes down to fundamentals most of the time
1517391 you imagine playing football when you are knee high and you imagine going out on top
1517392 it would just be the icing on the cake i guess
1517393 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much

1517596 if as the narrator informs us the car achieves a takeoff speed of 280 mph then using the equations of projectile motion we can easily calculate that without air resistance estimating a launch angle of about 30 degrees the maximum distance the car could achieve is around 1500 meters or just short of a mile ill leave it to those of you with a little physics background to confirm this is true however at speeds of this magnitude air resistance will have a major effect on the flight of the car the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity so if you double the speed you quadruple the air resistance incorporating the effect of air drag into the calculations we find that kenny wont even make it a quarter of a mile before falling ignominiously into the river

1517613 what a testimony to their love and faithfulness to jesus christ could we do that being a true saint requires that we accept any persecution joyfully persecution is the test that proves our love for god and our love for our neighbor
1517614 the men who conquered the roman empire for christ bore the aspect of invaders from another world who absolutely refused to be naturalized to this world their conduct filled their heathen neighbors with the strangest perplexity they were so careless of life so careful of conscience so confident of the overcoming power of the blood of the lamb so unsubdued to the custom of the country in which they sojourned so mindful of the manners of that country from whence they came not the help of the world the patronage of its rulers the loan of its resources the use of its methods they utterly refused lest by employing these they might compromise their king an invading army maintained from an invisible base and placing more confidence in the leadership of an unseen commander than in all imperial help that might be proffered that was what so bewildered and angered the heathen who often desired to make friends with the christians without abandoning their own gods but there can be no reasonable doubt that that age in which the church was so completely separated from the world was the age in which christianity was most victorious in the world
1517615 after the death of christ for two hundred years to become a christian meant the great renunciation the joining a despised and persecuted sect the swimming against the tide of popular prejudice the coming under the ban of the empire the possibility at any moment of imprisonment and death under its most fearful forms
1517616 the results of such an uncompromising victorious testimony were inevitable the church of today cannot endure the blaze kindled by those martyr fires such burning and shining lights discover to us how distant is our departure from the crucified mark well o popular christian and worldly preacher venturing how far you think you must go with the world in order to win the world never had the church so much influence over the world as when she had nothing to do with the world completely separated from that roman world those early christians plunged back into that sunken empire to lift it off its hinges and change the entire course of the worlds history
1517617 in john 17 jesus sets forth the christians position as
1517618 settle it in your mind o christian that because ye are not of the world therefore the world hateth you

1517620 if ever i become so one with the world so tolerant of its spirit and atmosphere that i reprove it no more incur not its hatred rouse not its enmity to christ if the world can find in me no cause to hate me and cast me from its company then i have betrayed christ and crucified him afresh in the house of his friends
1517621 it is the first condition of our initiation into the secret society of the friends of god that we take our place with him before the judgment seat of this world and are with him mocked patronized and misunderstood by the worlds religion the worlds culture the worlds power all the artificial contrivances that it sets up as standards by which to condemn reality in the very moment in which we declare that it cannot give us the intangible kingdom to which we aspire we alienate its sympathy insult its common sense it goes up into the judgment seat prepared to deal wisely with the rebel in us intolerant of the fool

1517650 its primary purpose is to inform discussions and debates because frankly there has been a lot of rubbish about who can claim sovereignty over what
1517651 to be honest most of the other maps that i have seen in the media have been very simple
1517652 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1517653 all coastal states have rights over the resources up to 200 nautical miles from their coastline

1517659 she was probably the most photographed person ever and she loved it there are very few bad photographs if any of her

1517662 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1517663 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1517664 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1517665 because of this oraquick test way more people accept hiv testing than otherwise might
1517666 but if in fact there are more false positives than anticipated we need to be prepared
1517667 if were going to start widely testing in a population where there hasnt been wide testing before were going to have to be really careful to have accurate and robust testing
1517668 there are now a number of companies that are getting close to introducing a new generation of rapid tests
1517669 an internist may be the ideal person to initiate the hiv testing encounter and handle any potential false positive results but many people under the current health care system dont have that kind of provider
1517670 if we screen people and dont get them into care weve done little to help the patients
1517671 he realised this was escalating into a problem affecting the lives of ordinary people because they were scared by the prospect of what they would witness if they went for a civilised night out so all you human rights do godders and amateur social workers take heed
1517672 one of the beauties of sport is the speed sometimes that things happen i dont think anyone would have predicted this a couple of weeks ago
1517673 my job as coach is to build up that relationship with kevin to move us forward i have always found kevin fine what i like about him is he has a view and that will be important in his captaincy
1517674 he is passionate and committed about his cricket traits i like in a player he is positive and he is prepared to work extremely hard to get what he wants
1517675 we talked for a good hour or so and i think we both drove away quite buoyant about what the future might hold we felt very comfortable with each other
1517676 i expected the job to be challenging and i would not have signed up if i didnt think i could handle that
1517677 if someone who has played as long as he has takes the view that it is time to move on you have to respect that i listened to what he had to say and was keen for him to be happy that he had made the right decision
1517678 in some ways i think we were both quite relieved he had made it he had done a great job but it was time for someone else to have a go
1517679 i have no concerns about kevins batting being affected he has shown he can handle pressure well and that is one of the crucial things he will need as a leader
1517680 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1517681 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1517682 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1517683 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1517684 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1517685 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1517686 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1517687 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1517688 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1517689 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1517690 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1517691 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1517692 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1517693 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1517694 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1517695 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1517696 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1517697 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1517698 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1517699 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1517700 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1517701 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1517702 when rain did fall it was falling inside the sandbags and cant get out i had a swamp around my house i couldnt get stuff out of the house or get house repairs done nothing until these people came and volunteered their time

1517707 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
1517708 i think someone who does that is sick and to do it with kids outside especially kids in wheelchairs
1517709 so we hurried up and got them out of the front yard and into the church then we got them out of the church by telling them it was a fire drill so they would not get too excited
1517710 it was a special needs scout troop they were learning how to pitch a tent whats wrong with you
1517711 what we need to be doing is taking those tax dollars and being fiscally responsible with them making sure that we find viable alternative energies that we can invest those dollars into
1517712 ive seen so many people lose their jobs even my wife lost her job
1517713 i think people who are particularly very engaged who arent just looking at commercials or who arent just watching the nightly news and really want to see well thats nice that youre deeply concerned about the healthcare situation but what exactly are you going to do about it and were getting out there and telling people
1517714 the more that i know the more im able to go out and get people to vote and tell them about the program
1517715 i think we need to educate ourselves we need to know what we believe we need to know what each of the candidates believe

1517727 you will get disastrous results you end up either getting stuck or resorting to some form of violence
1517728 power without love is reckless and abusive and love without power is sentimental and anemic
1517729 we dont have a choice between power and love we have to do both

1517732 i came to the office today just thinking about the oriole game not necessarily making a blockbuster deal
1517733 ive been dealing with latroy hawkins being designated for assignment ive got some activity there and at some point i hoped to conclude something on him but nothing like this
1517734 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1517735 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1517736 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1517737 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1517738 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1517739 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1517740 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1517741 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1517742 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1517743 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1517744 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1517745 throwing the baby out with the bathwater its somewhat ridiculous to say that scientific method can help us to shed light on all of the questions that literary theory has been engaged with
1517746 if literary darwinism manages to improve the way to understand and explain literary form then it will be a great step forward but if it eludes form or just doesnt see it then it will mean exactly nothing
1517747 if youre interested in questions of sexism you need to look at more than expressions of stereotypes you need to look at the way that the narrative is shaped you need to look at questions of closure in narrative questions of sequence and questions that fall into the category of narratology im not sure that by taking samples and doing statistical processing that youre going to get very far
1517748 is riddled with basic errors in study design and methodology
1517749 what youve got is just another way of coming up with interpretations of texts and im not sure we need that so urgently unless they really have something new to tell us about the nature of the text and if there is something new there should be a way of validating it empirically so in that sense their resistance to doing empirical studies seems to be a real disability its disappointing that they dont go to that next stage
1517750 many in the group have no background in statistics or evolutionary biology and they frequently work alone instead of in groups with scientists unlike many of the cognitive theorists and empirical literary critics
1517751 the scholars tend to see themselves as outsiders denied jobs at prestigious universities tenured positions and grant money because of the iconoclastic nature of their work gottschall is still an adjunct and he says he believes that no one of a principally darwinian bent has tenure except for those who originally started down a more traditional path

1517760 obama remains the mysterious stranger rather than the american adam to too many voters who are put off rather than attracted by his race and exotic background
1517761 since 9 11 our principal export to the world has been our fear
1517762 we wanted to have every opportunity to try and trade him even though that opportunity may still exist now that weve passed the july 31 deadline it was important for us to continue our transition into a club that is looking towards the 2009 season even as we try to win as many games as possible this season

1517771 she just lost her best friend really and her brother you know
1517772 he joined the air force because whitehall is a small town and theres really not much here
1517773 when you first meet spencer hes got like just a way of making you fall in love with him
1517774 he makes you feel like youre his best friend the minute you meet him
1517775 spencer said ill sign up if you hang out with us later
1517776 he would just get up and dance and sing to me in the middle of a store
1517777 he liked to be the center of attention he was a big clown
1517778 from when he was a little kid next door to when i gave him a big hug at graduation there was a smile there was fun
1517779 he would be driving down the road and see something and start making rhymes and they were ridiculous
1517780 he was that guy in the huddle that would get everybody fired up

1517783 outlined a new process for hiring immigration judges that listed the white house as the sole source for generating candidates
1517784 they are the poster child for how a rogue company can exploit a broken immigration system
1517785 after an exhaustive review of strategic alternatives our board of directors has determined that this offer from planet hollywood represents the best overall value for our shareholders in addition the financing from planet hollywood will provide us with the liquidity we need to continue to move our business forward
1517786 companies tell me we have an immigration system that allows us to hire illegal workers legally
1517787 why are employers not punished more often because the laws we have dont really authorize that
1517788 if you want law enforcement you have to have laws that are enforceable
1517789 has just been chronically flawed from the time it was passed
1517790 theres no question this administration is coddling unscrupulous employers while arresting undocumented immigrants in order to make their statistics look good
1517791 the dysfunctional immigration system really is the fault of congress for failing to lead
1517792 the most interesting finding from this experiment however was that when it was carried out amongst students the most selfish behaviour the behaviour regarded as most rational by classical economics was exhibited by those students studying economics in other words being taught to perceive the world through the goggles of classical economic theory altered the way students conceptualized their relationship with other humans and with the world as a whole

1517796 it all arrives on saturdays and they are kind enough to bring it over
1517797 some of the folks selling at the market have produce in excess that they might not be able to sell its hard for us to get fresh anything throughout the year so its great to have this its fresh healthy and tastes good it saves us having to go out and buy it most of the meals here are prepared by volunteers sometimes they cook here but not often our kitchen is not sufficient for number people we need to feed were putting out 80 plates of food on average each night church groups or families take on a night we get a great variety of stuff that way dinner is probably the only pleasant part of staying here we always serve balanced meals
1517798 this summer however has the most coordinated effort thats ever been done
1517799 i have been involved in local farming for years and in the past it happened at random or occasionally this year there is a collaboration of local groups and we set it up in advance with cross roads house the farmers are getting into the habit of gleaning
1517800 we brought a ton of green beans a couple of weeks ago
1517801 we were swimming in them even though tomatoes are a precious item we do have some they cant sell the seconds that arent as pretty theyre perfectly good but people pass them over
1517802 saving us money at the grocery store and feeding our residents better than ever even introducing them to foods they have not had the pea shoots were really a brand new salad treat for every one i cant wait to see what comes each week thanks so much to all the farmers

1517810 the tower relates to the immediate context of downtown los angeles and the other cultural institutions within a spiral in the form of a 9 which revolves around the tower completes the sculpture and is an expression of the dynamic development of our society
1517811 when congress adjourns so do live broadcasts because the sole cameras that record the sessions of the senate and the house of representatives are controlled by the members of congress
1517812 not all but still too many americans especially within the middle strata although not only there are in a real sense falling into acting like children easily distracted with toys here at midnight tonight the new i phone people will line up and fight each other to get in line to get the new i phone but they cant bring themselves to mobilize against the torture and the wars and everything else that is being done by their government in their name and right before their eyes this is not even really being hidden
1517813 refusal to resist crimes against humanity is itself a crime
1517814 i want to say just for the record that at times i myself have been acutely disappointed by and yes have cursed in graphic terms the people in this society who are sitting by and doing nothing in the face of atrocities and horrors committed by their government and in their name
1517815 as for people who are politically backward communists should not slight or despise them but should befriend them unite with them convince them and encourage them to go forward
1517816 a communist must never be opinionated or domineering thinking that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing he must never shut himself up in his little room or brag and boast and lord it over others
1517817 the politics of the possible is the politics of monstrosity to adhere to or acquiesce in the politics of the possible is to support and actually to facilitate monstrosity
1517818 maoists and iphones on new tech and blaming the people
1517819 but this verdict conflates mushes and confuses two things the willingness of the masses to act and their willingness to act along specific lines demanded by this small political group for communists to confuse these things is to lose the mass line completely
1517820 but if the likes of the rcp goes into the community suddenly without having any ties without really being involved in the struggles that people are waging i think this has more to do with them the rcp not having hegemony over those struggles and they would have to contend with different forces and lines
1517821 stop thinking youre the awesome shit and get down with people all people to try to figure out what is really going on and to figure the best way to unite with them and draw them forward politically
1517822 get the crap off your iphone and get in this protest
1517823 the politics of the possible is the politics of monstrosity to adhere to or acquiesce in the politics of the possible is to support and actually to facilitate monstrosity
1517824 these are two very important programs that we provide for the schools which my department recognizews as invaluable to the community

1517841 according to this year s state of the net survey mac users fall prey to phishing scams at about the same rate as windows users yet far fewer of them protect themselves with an anti phishing toolbar to make matters worse the browser of choice for most mac users apple s safari has no phishing protection we think it should what you can do until apple beefs up safari use a browser with phishing protection such as the latest version of firefox shown at right or opera also try a free anti phishing toolbar such as mcafee site advisor or firephish

1517849 why to raise the bar challenging myself to run 100 miles is easy now so 2175 miles should satisfy my need to go further also if i can have a good run at the record it is possible that i could drop that record significantly it could be a record that stands for a while its hard to say what will happen but the challenge of not knowing is the real fun of it not to mention as we promote to the media itll be fun for everyone to watch me suffer

1517890 the uspstf concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for prostate cancer using prostate specific antigen psa testing or digital rectal examination dre
1517891 the potential harms of prostate cancer screening include fairly frequent false positive results from psa screening which may lead to unnecessary anxiety and biopsies in addition early detection and treatment may result in complications from treating some cancers that may never have affected a patients health
1517892 in men younger than age 75 years the uspstf found inadequate evidence to determine whether treatment for prostate cancer detected by screening improves health outcomes compared with treatment after clinical detection
1517893 in men age 75 years or older the uspstf found adequate evidence that the incremental benefits of treatment for prostate cancer detected by screening are small to none
1517894 the uspstf found convincing evidence that treatment for prostate cancer detected by screening causes moderate to substantial harms such as erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence bowel dysfunction and death
1517895 there is also adequate evidence that the screening process produces at least small harms including pain and discomfort associated with prostate biopsy and psychological effects of false positive test results
1517896 the uspstf concludes that for men younger than age 75 years the benefits of screening for prostate cancer are uncertain and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined
1517897 for men 75 years or older there is moderate certainty that the harms of screening for prostate cancer outweigh the benefits
1517898 older men african american men and men with a family history of prostate cancer are at increased risk for diagnosis of and death from prostate cancer 1 unfortunately the previously described gaps in the evidence regarding potential benefits of screening also apply to these men
1517899 the yield of screening in terms of cancer cases detected declines rapidly with repeated annual testing if screening were to reduce deaths psa screening as infrequently as every 4 years could yield as much of a benefit as annual screening

1517918 based on the current share price and the fixed exchange ratio the current offer undervalues brnc
1517919 in conclusion given the relatively restricted sale process re rating of the sector as reflected in the significant share price increases and upward revisions in ebitda estimates for the peer group since announcement of the initial merger transaction valuation analysis which indicates that brncs stand lone value is greater than that implied by the current offer price and the fact that brncs stock price is trading marginally above the offer price we recommend shareholders vote against the proposed merger transaction
1517920 in light of our strong belief in the future prospects of bronco we believe that the proposed merger price is woefully inadequate without significant improvement in the consideration being offered to broncos shareholders we believe that bronco should remain a stand alone company
1517921 our view that the merger is not in the best interests of bronco and its shareholders is based on numerous facts we believe the merger significantly undervalues bronco in our view bronco should be worth 25 30 share a substantial premium to the approximately 17 share value offered in the merger
1517922 we believe that the price being offered to broncos shareholders by allis chalmers is inadequate
1517923 we do not support this proposal because in the context of share price appreciation for peers in the period since the announcement it does not appear to offer a meaningful takeover premium and because the share price itself which is currently at a premium to the proposed merger consideration seems to bolster the arguments of large shareholders that the deal undervalues the company
1517924 we reiterate our outperform rating and 22 comparable multiple derived price target due to a strong underlying land rig market and our expectation that fewer than 50 of brncs shareholders will vote for the aly merger agreement such a rejection of the current deal should allow the market to recognize the value of brnc that has been capped by the under priced aly offer
1517925 given the dramatic improvement in land rig fundamentals this year we generally agree with the dissenting shareholders that the aly transaction undervalues the company
1517926 brnc as stand alone likely to benefit from improving us land rig dayrates and utilization and expansion into mexico stock performance tied to aly pending shareholder vote aug 14th recent shareholders publicly voicing displeasure with the new deal terms and proxy services urging a vote against the merger suggest deal may now be less likely
1517927 we continue to believe that the allis chalmers offer price undervalues bronco as a stand alone entity particularly given the recent weakness in allis chalmers stock broncos new mexico platform and the improvement in the u s land drilling market over the last several months
1517928 millions of drills are sold to people every year who do not want a drill what they want is the hole and of course the drill is the route to that but ultimately it is the hole they are after in other words they dont care about the tool as much as the benefit that the tool provides its the same with mind mapping

1518001 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
1518002 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
1518003 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life
1518004 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do for example i remember how the family of saleh talahmeh a member of the military arm of hamas who was assassinated by israel was forced to beg for financial assistance because they were left with nothing after his death the hamas leadership abandoned them as well as the families of other shaheeds martyrs while the senior members of the organization abroad wasted tens of thousand of dollars a month only on security for themselves
1518005 even some of the current leaders of hamas were involved in the past in the security arm in the prisons so that he is among those responsible for these acts they were suspicious of prisoners who spent too much time in the bathroom even if it was only an upset stomach they suspected that the prisoner was transferring information or alternatively having sexual relations with other men a homosexual the gays were immediately suspected of collaboration then i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
1518006 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
1518007 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1518008 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
1518009 you have to understand i was never one of them although i helped my father and accompanied him i was always opposed to the use of terror hamas members didnt like me i didnt come to pray in the mosques i hung around with strangers they didnt like my leather jacket or even my jeans they considered it going astray but i helped my father and conducted his affairs because hes my father not because hes a leader in hamas im not a hamas activist who converted to christianity thats not the story i wanted to help my father understand that harming innocent people is forbidden and through him perhaps to change other peoples thinking
1518010 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
1518011 but within hamas there were other leaders mainly from the gaza strip and damascus who thought they had to continue with suicide attacks as an effective means of achieving their aims the problem was that they were stronger than my father in terms of their status in the organization what helped stop the attacks in the final analysis was israels attacks against the hamas leaders
1518012 he had no connection to the military arm but they always consulted him about strategic decisions the hamas leadership did not make decisions only according to the opinion of the organization leaders in syria or gaza however you have to remember that the hamas leadership in damascus was in control of the organizations money therefore it had the most influence on organization policy they were also the only ones who were not restricted in contacting one another as opposed to the leaderships in the west bank and gaza so that they also served as go betweens among all the groups in hamas and incidentally although they now claim that the revolution in gaza was not planned i can tell you from clear knowledge that a year earlier in the summer of 2006 they spoke among themselves to the effect that if the tension with fatah continued they intended to take control of the strip
1518013 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
1518014 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
1518015 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
1518016 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
1518017 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
1518018 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
1518019 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
1518020 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
1518021 i hope that ill succeed one day in becoming a writer in order to write about my personal story and about the middle east conflict but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
1518022 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
1518023 i hope that someday god will give the opportunity to meet the right one she will have to be a believing christian and if shes a jew who converted even better
1518024 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1518025 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is

1518111 the majority of men dont abuse women but there is a responsibility on men to speak up and speak out about it
1518112 the noise that men have made about it in the past has never been loud enough i think thats a perspective i can bring to the whole discussion
1518113 i have always tried to be frank and upfront about things and to go out of my way to engage
1518114 for me it is not about just maintaining the status quo but looking at effective ways to deal with the problems
1518115 this is about the sort of society and communities we want to live in
1518116 the womens movement has done a fantastic job foregrounding this work
1518117 what i want to do is to continue making it mainstream
1518118 the coalition has the potential to challenge the negative and often destructive culture that has such a detrimental effect on our families children and ultimately ourselves
1518119 so many of the people we spoke to in sweden were as concerned about the statement the law made about having a criminal offence to buy sex as they were about the practical outcomes
1518120 it was the statement it makes about the sort of society its citizens want it to be
1518121 the fact that there was not a peep demonstrates just how far we have come
1518122 i havent heard that but i dont mind it at all
1518123 of course there are male victims of domestic violence and male victims of rape but by and large the majority of the victims are women and the perpetrators are males
1518124 once a rape case gets to court there is a 34 chance of conviction which is not so bad
1518125 you make the absolute assertion that rape is a criminal act one of the most heinous we know and there will be consequences it is about teaching respect and educating men to bring about attitudinal change it is a massive step forward to discuss these things now the challenge is how we move things forward

1518145 offshore drilling with the consent of the states is an integral part of any energy independence plan
1518146 since the 1970s our country has had an irrational view of nuclear power
1518147 this view is best demonstrated by our nations refusal to allow recycling of spent fuel rods

1518149 we call for an apollo project like effort to support the goal of transitioning 85 percent of american new motor vehicles to non petroleum based fuels within the next 20 years
1518150 quite frankly this particular tax incentive was never asked for by the oil companies
1518151 it is irrational to be allocating around 1 billion per year in tax dollars to assist in production at a time when oil is 124 per barrel and companies are recording record profits
1518152 it is clear to the american people their congress is broken i appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to try to jumpstart serious discussions on how to solve america s energy crisis

1518156 sandwich and took the fleet to sea again in july with penn as his second in command
1518157 the usual manning and victualling problems compounded by plague in england made prolonged cruising unattractive sandwich therefore took the fleet north narrowly missing de ruyter on the way to the coast of norway which was ruled by denmark therefore friendly to the dutch and the obvious landfall for inward bound dutch shipping
1518158 discovering that the voc convoy was in bergen sandwich sent in a force under rear admiral thomas teddeman to attack unfortunately although frederick ii was indeed planning a treacherous attack on his ally his orders to the governor of bergen had not yet arrived and when teddemann attacked on 2 august he was beaten off by a determined defence by commodore peter de bieter and the danish batteries instead of a strategic and financial coup the defeat forced denmark back into dutch arms

1518182 the business market however is another story the smallest of businesses can certainly take advantage of this type of solution but any small to medium business making more than five simultaneous calls will have problems switching to voip for one main reason
1518183 internet bandwidth is still too small and too expensive most small to medium businesses have dsl cable or t1 connections to the internet where the upload speed is no more than 1 5 megabits per second mbps at 60 kilobits per second kbps per voice call this starts to really add up and when you factor in normal internet usage and soho routers that cant prioritize voip traffic you will soon be dropping calls and having tinny voice quality this causes employees and customers to become frustrated and potentially results in lost business due to poor voice quality and company representation
1518184 that being said there is one huge advantage to running voip in your business and that is as an alternative to a legacy pbx pbx systems from companies such as lucent nec and mitel can be horrendously expensive even at entry level pricing companies can spend in excess of 25 000 for a pbx that has minimal features beyond providing dial tone and voice mail capability for additional features or to run a reliable call center the price can skyrocket to anywhere from 100 000 to 500 000 by replacing a legacy pbx with an asterisk based solution such as fonalitys trixbox system you can make literally hundreds of calls within your lan without a reduction in voice quality and you can get premium pbx features such as conference calling call queuing an auto attendant voice mail to email paging and intercom and music on hold for a fraction of the cost of a legacy pbx
1518185 when used as what i like to call a hybrid pbx system this solution can be a huge advantage in both features and cost savings if you use standard pots phone lines or a voice t1 pri for connectivity to the outside world in conjunction with a voip based pbx for your internal call routing and functionality you are getting the best of both worlds and an extremely reliable telephony solution asterisk based pbx systems have their foundation in linux which has already proven itself to be the most stable enterprise level operating system available today i have had linux servers in production data centers online for in excess of 400 days straight without a reboot linux web servers running apache serve the largest percentage of web pages on the internet today i am completely comfortable using it for telephony as well used with the proven reliability of the ma bell telecommunications infrastructure that has been in place for decades now hundreds of companies are switching to this type of solution and the stock prices of legacy pbx providers going into the toilet is proof positive that the paradigm is shifting
1518186 just a year ago there was one sector where the hybrid pbx solution fell way short and that was for companies with call centers larger than 20 agents the problem for those companies was not so much the lack of voip technology but rather the lack of management and reporting tools for medium to large call centers but just in the last ten months there are now great solutions available and they are getting better all the time voip still has tremendous potential in this industry when you consider options such as work at home agents seamless cross country or international call routing and cost reduction however no one has yet created tools robust enough to compete with the agent and call detail reporting and management you can get with a legacy pbx solution attention investors there is a huge opportunity for innovators in this market if you dont mind battling the big boys
1518187 as we are starting to see internet connections of 10mbps and higher coming into homes and businesses using voip for both internal and external voice calls will become a much more viable solution within five years once huge fiber links straight to the home and office are commonplace and internet bandwidth is sufficient to handle both normal web traffic and tens if not hundreds of simultaneous voice calls with ease there will be a new paradigm in place to the benefit of home users as well as small to medium businesses within our lifetimes i believe we can expect to see the downfall of the legacy telephony infrastructure just as analog broadcast television is finally dying out in favor of digital cable voip will reign supreme before we know it

1518193 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1518194 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1518195 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1518196 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1518197 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1518198 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1518199 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1518200 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter

1518323 pneumonia is a common complication of influenza infection in elderly individuals and could therefore potentially be prevented by influenza vaccination
1518324 in studies with data from administrative sources vaccinated elderly people had a reduced risk of admission for pneumonia compared with unvaccinated seniors however these findings could have been biased by underlying differences in health between the groups furthermore since most individuals with pneumonia are not treated in hospital such studies should include both outpatient and inpatient events
1518325 the effect of influenza vaccination on the risk of pneumonia in elderly people during influenza seasons might be less than previously estimated
1518326 more studies that use laboratory confirmed outcomes and adjust for a broad range of confounding variables will provide valuable information about the effects of antigenic match and other factors that affect vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults
1518327 however interpretation of the results of vaccine effectiveness might be difficult despite optimum study design in observational studies of elderly populations in which vaccine coverage is high residual confounding can never be ruled out when a small proportion of the population chooses to remain unvaccinated
1518328 but it is one i have to say i could see coming we have had a very awkward pre season where we have regularly failed to reach the level of play of last season and we suffered for that again tonight
1518329 all credit to kaunas for the way they have set out their stall over the two games but for us it is a total disappointment
1518330 we are all aware of the financial consequences for the club and that is something we just have to face
1518331 i feel totally disappointed the truth is we didnt really deserve much more from this game tonight if we had got through then i would have counted us as being a bit lucky as i say failing to reach the level that we performed at last season has been a recurring feature of our play so far
1518332 some might say there is a hangover from our european endeavours of last season but it is not an excuse i want to offer
1518333 it has been fantastic effort by my players the key to it for us was doing what we did in glasgow last week my players arent used to performing before big crowds but we got the result we needed to give us the chance it is a great achievement for my team we are a small club compared to rangers who are a very big club and we also play in a small championship here in lithuania so it is a fantastic achievement for kaunas

1518532 the applications of these small wind turbines are almost endless
1518533 we will be doing everything from small ones which fit on your roof to the bigger ones that would theoretically eliminate your power need altogether from national grid smaller ones would offset power usage and give a person an automatic 20 to 40 discount on their electric usage
1518534 once i started looking at wind maps i found the western area of chautauqua county as well as the county as a whole erie county and cattaraugus county is windier than normal
1518535 it turns out that new york state is the 15th windiest state in the union and the western new york and chautauqua area specifically is one of the windier areas in the state
1518536 we saw a niche in the market that we think is something that is going to become increasingly popular
1518537 we really want to just sort of establish ourselves as the western new york leader of this new emerging renewable resource field
1518538 i cant emphasize enough the forward thinking nature of this type of stuff

1518545 ensuring a healthy ocean environment for current and future generations
1518546 just as weve seen with the western regional climate action initiative collaboration on complex natural resource issues leads to improved management inspires innovation and ensures a healthier environment together we can sustain our marine resources and the communities that depend upon them
1518547 while washington is making significant strides with state initiatives such as the puget sound partnership the crisis facing salmon this year is an example of why we must address these issues together as a region
1518548 this plan commits us to combining our resources and ideas and prioritizes restoring and maintaining the health of our marine and coastal waters to ensure a sustainable future

1518555 whereas the tenth amendment to the constitution of the united states reads as follows the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people and whereas the tenth amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the constitution of the united states and no more and whereas the scope of power defined by the tenth amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states and whereas today in 2008 the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives and the senate of the 2 nd session of the 51 st oklahoma legislature that the state of oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the tenth amendment to the constitution of the united states over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the constitution of the united states that this serve as notice and demand to the federal government as our agent to cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers

1518557 another step towards making scotland the green energy capital of europe
1518558 the clyde wind farm will represent a very important step in the development of renewable energy in scotland and in meeting shared european targets
1518559 todays announcement makes it virtually certain that the 2011 target will be met early and exceeded by the end of this parliamentary term and represents a significant milestone on the way to achieving the 2020 target
1518560 projects like clyde are essential if scotland and the uk are to have any hope of meeting legally binding eu targets for renewable energy scottish ministers aim to make scotland the green energy capital of europe and giving the clyde wind farm consent is evidence of a willingness to take decisions which are consistent with that ambition
1518561 clyde is clearly going to be a major project with significant economic opportunities for the local community
1518562 scotland has a clear competitive advantage in developing clean green energy sources such as wind wave and tidal power
1518563 we have put renewable energy at the heart of our vision of increasing sustainable economic growth
1518564 installed renewables capacity is already greater than nuclear capacity but this announcement demonstrates that we are only at the start of the renewables revolution in scotland
1518565 combined with the crucial announcement of a new biomass plant in fife on friday the clyde declaration today makes this weekend one of the biggest advances ever in energy technology in scotland

1518584 yang halal sudah jelas dan yang haram pun sudah jelas di antara keduanya ada beberapa perkara yang belum jelas syubhat banyak orang yang tidak tahu apakah itu termasuk bagian yang halal atau bagian yang haram maka siapa yang menjauhinya karena hendak membersihkan agama dan kehormatannya dia akan selamat dan barang siapa mengerjakan sedikit pun darinyahampir hampir ia terjatuh pada yang haram sebagaimana orang yang menggembala kambing di sekitar daerah larangan dia hampir hampir akan jatuh kepadanya ingat pula bahwa raja mempunyai daerah larangan ingat pula bahwa daerah larangan allah itu ialah semua yang diharamkan
1518585 demi allah kalau sekiranya fatimah binti muhammad yang mencuri pasti akan kupotong tangannya
1518586 lalu siapa dalam keadaan terpaksa dengan tidak sengaja dan tidak melewati batas maka tiada berdosa atasnya karena sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha belas kasih
1518587 allah tidak menghendaki untuk memberikan kamu sesuatu beban yang berat tetapi ia berkehendak untuk membersihkan kamu dan menyempurnakan nikmatnya kepadamu supaya kamu berterima kasih
1518588 telah diharamkan atas kamu bangkai darah daging babi binatang yang disembelih bukan karena allah yang mati karena dicekik yang mati karena dipukul yang mati karena jatuh dari atas yang mati karena ditanduk yang mati karena dimakan oleh binatang buas kecuali yang dapat kamu sembelih dan ynag disembelih untuk berhala
1518589 rasulullah saw mengambil sutra ia letakan di sebelah kanannya dan ia mengambil emas kemudia diletakkan di ssebelah kirinya lantas ia berkata kedua ini haram untuk orang laki laki dari umatku
1518590 hai nabi katakanlah pada istri istrimu anak anak perempuanmu dan istri istri orang mukmin semua hendaklah mereka mengulurkan jilbabnya atas muka muka mereka yang demikian itu lebih mendekati mereka untuk dikenal sebagai perempuan baik baik supaya mereka tidak diganggu
1518591 maukah kamu saya terangkan sebesar besar dosa besar tiga kali mereka menjawab mau ya rasulullah maka bersabdalah nabi yaitu menyekutukan allah durhaka kepada orang tua waktu itu beliau berdiri sambil bersandar kemudian duduk dan selanjutya bersabda ingatlah dan termasuk dosa besar adalah omongan dusta dan saksi dusta
1518592 hai orang orang yang beriman takutlah kepada allah dan tinggalkanlah apa yang tertinggal dari riba jika kamu benar benar beriman apabila kamu tidak berbuat demikian terimalah peperangan dari allah dan rasulnya dan jika kamu tobat maka bagiannya adalah pokok harta kamu kamu tidak boleh berbuat zalim juga tidak mau dizhalimi

1518610 precisamos ter um controle das a es policiais discutamos a cria o de varas e corregedorias de pol cia no mbito federal por que n o precisamos estar abertos a essa discuss o exatamente para evitar os abusos podemos discutir isso no conselho nacional de justi a cnj fundamental que n s discutamos isso uma nova lei de abuso de autoridade eventualmente varas especializadas para corregedoria da pol cia e para contestar os abusos
1518611 combate criminalidade sim mas com respeito aos direitos fundamentais quem eventualmente defende a observ ncia dos direitos fundamentais n o est assumindo a defesa da corrup o todos queremos a efici ncia no combate criminalidade ningu m quer celebrar um pacto quanto impunidade mas n o nos dado fazer escolhas em rela o aos princ pios b sicos do estado de direito
1518612 os meios tecnol gicos dispon veis para investiga es da pol cia federal evolu ram profundamente nos ltimos 10 15 anos isso implicou uma transforma o da metodologia da investiga o que s vezes proporciona determinados excessos n s j remetemos ao congresso um projeto de lei que pro be por exemplo a grava o de conversa entre cliente e advogado quando esses meios tecnol gicos ainda n o eram dispon veis o inqu rito policial ordinariamente come ava com o interrogat rio do suspeito que se dava s vezes por meios n o ortodoxos n o constitucionais as pessoas sofriam viol ncia s vezes viol ncia f sica e aquele depoimento orientava o inqu rito que s vezes chegava cheio de v cios ao judici rio com as transforma es tecnol gicas que ocorreram foram oferecidos meios mais cient ficos de investiga o temos de ver a fase pela qual estamos passando como virtuosa uma coisa a persecu o criminal buscar a verdade quando se investiga um delito outra utilizar esses meios tecnol gicos para uma gest o manipulat ria do estado ou para a produ o de persecu es pol ticas
1518613 diante dos avan os tecnol gicos j n o se pode nem cumprir a lei estabelecida porque n o se consegue transcrever a quantidade de horas gravadas
1518614 existem in meras investiga es em curso em todo o brasil a maioria delas sem nenhuma utiliza o desses procedimentos de escuta telef nica mas n o v m ao conhecimento p blico o minist rio p blico tem trabalhado firmemente para impedir esses desvios em opera es da pol cia federal que devem ser punidos e essa puni o s vir com absoluta certeza a operacionaliza o do trabalho do minist rio p blico s ser definitiva quando tivermos mecanismos mais efetivos de controle dos atos que s o feitos
1518615 a quest o do vazamento em dropes parcelado de informa es muito grave s vezes com intuito de prejudicar a imagem das pessoas de forma indel vel n o poss vel que o estado valendo se de um poder excepcional fa a isto n o razo vel fundamental que se co ba esse tipo de pr tica e a m dia aqui tem responsabilidade fundamental que discutamos isso com toda a abertura o vazamento hoje n o mais a exce o a regra
1518616 neste momento h tamb m um interesse da m dia em divulgar o minist rio p blico tem feito um esfor o muito grande mas reconhece ainda dificuldades principalmente nessa quest o de vazamentos de identificar a autoria eu acho que devemos trabalhar o crit rio de se dar mais seguran a nesses procedimentos para garantir exatamente o conhecimento das pessoas que manusearam informa o a partir de que momento e de onde ela partiu
1518617 temos de verificar regrar algum tipo de precau o contra a divulga o de informa es infamantes e caluniosas sem ferir a liberdade de imprensa isso tem de passar inclusive por um pacto com a pr pria imprensa porque s vezes o que se v al m do vazamento que j uma ilegalidade o uso calunioso do vazamento
1518618 n o podemos aceitar a l gica de que a defesa atrapalha de que se a defesa atrapalha devemos acabar com o direito de defesa no brasil esse um debate atual porque temos um projeto disposi o do presidente lula que trata exclusivamente de reconhecer que no conflito estado cidad o o cidad o n o pode ser a v tima do estado a forma pela qual o cidad o fala para o estado atrav s do seu advogado da sua defesa alguns acusadores passaram a imagem de que iam transformar os escrit rios em dep sitos do crime colocariam se cad veres em escrit rios de advocacia ou n o compreenderam o que a democracia o estado democr tico de direito ou n o leram o projeto atividade criminosa n o inerente advocacia o crime n o tem liga o com a advocacia n o tem nunca teve e nunca ter o apoio da ordem a primeira mentira que foi contada e repetida repete se e as pessoas acreditam nela de que esse projeto blinda a advocacia o que o projeto quis estabelecer e o fez muito bem foi separar o joio do trigo um erro n o pode justificar o outro se algum advogado errou compactuou com o crime ele deixa de ser advogado e passa a ser criminoso comum como qualquer outro e tem a pol cia federal o direito de entrar no escrit rio de advocacia e processar a ele e a seu cliente o que n o pode n o deve sen o n o estar amos no estado democr tico de direito interferir na defesa escutar a defesa bisbilhotar a defesa espionar a defesa
1518619 quando se discutem quest es sobre a liberdade do juiz de primeira inst ncia devemos levar em conta este fen meno o controle ideol gico e muitas vezes psicol gico que se exerce contra essas pessoas n o h na hist ria do mundo na hist ria universal qualquer exemplo de pa s que tenha preservado a democracia tendo transformado a pol cia em poder onde a pol cia se transformou em poder a democracia feneceu h casos de den ncia que beiram a aventura o processo anaconda sobre venda de senten as judiciais denunciou juiz por ter conta no afeganist o
1518620 o que estamos propondo revogarmos no brasil esse estado de medo que atinge todos e n o atinge s a advocacia atinge a todos n s ningu m quer decidir mais nada ningu m quer fazer mais nada com medo da responsabiliza o com medo de ser apontado no outro dia como criminoso em potencial ficamos raciocinando pela l gica do medo e o medo raciocinado sempre fazendo com que o estado seja a raz o de todas as coisas e o cidad o um criminoso em potencial em todas as coisas o estado tudo pode pode controlar o cidad o n o tenho d vida ministro gilmar mendes de que n o estamos em um estado policial o tema desta confer ncia uma reflex o para que evitemos enquanto tempo e cheguemos a essa discuss o
1518621 a pol cia federal n o uma institui o soberana se assim o fosse se colocaria acima dos demais poderes de estado e ter amos aqui no brasil um estado policial isso n o existe perdoe britto perdoe gilmar mendes mas n o verdade que estejamos num estado de medo isso n o verdade at porque se n s corrigirmos essas a es da pf a es determinadas pelo poder judici rio corrigirmos erros do judici rio da primeira inst ncia segunda inst ncia corrigirmos erros do minist rio p blico n o vamos acabar com as escutas telef nicas
1518622 quando n s discutimos a quest o do uso das algemas num cidad o que foi preso pela pol cia federal eu me propus a seguinte quest o todas as pessoas t m de ser tratadas de maneira igual a lei permite que o agente verifique a oportunidade ou n o de custodiar aquela pessoa mediante algemas enquanto a lei n o for modificada isso est delegado ao agente agora o que n o podemos expor qualquer pessoa seja de que n vel social ela for h um apenamento antecipado pela sua exposi o p blica na m dia isso uma atitude arbitr ria do estado que tem de ser vencida
1518623 em rela o s algemas e aqui tamb m eu ressalto a comunh o de pensamento com o ministro tarso que n o se trata de privilegiar pobres ou ricos n s queremos direitos fundamentais para todos e n o enfatizarmos um modelo de classes queremos direitos fundamentais para todos a pris o em muitos casos s se justifica para fazer a imagem e a imagem com algema prender algemar e expor no jornal nacional n s vamos discutir essa quest o na quinta feira j existe em rela o a todos indigna o sobre uso de algema sejam pobres ou ricos em mat ria de habeas corpus o tribunal extremamente aberto est vamos discutindo uma quest o relevant ssima da progress o de regime a partir da provoca o de um r u ele pr prio impetrou habeas corpus de uma carta feita em pres dio temos uma sociedade marcadamente desigual logo o acesso justi a tamb m comprometido muitas vezes as pessoas n o chegam ao supremo tribunal federal porque n o t m advogado
1518624 dif cil porque s o dois valores um o direito informa o e a busca da not cia um dos aspectos mais relevantes da sociedade democr tica de outra parte a preserva o da integridade moral do indiv duo problem tico tamb m porque hoje a pol tica se transformou em um grande espet culo com a cria o de muitos fatos midi ticos e pouco conte do e isso n o uma decad ncia da democracia uma nova etapa sobre a qual n s devemos nos debru ar para localiz la isso s poderia ser resolvido por uma normatiza o forte da lei de abuso de autoridade e concomitante um grande pacto pol tico uma concerta o pol tica do estado com a imprensa que exerce uma fun o p blica relevante a imprensa hoje n o mais como a segunda guerra mundial que tentava interferir no comportamento
1518625 o minist rio p blico defende a ampla defesa dos acusados mas tamb m defende a sua possibilidade e pelos mesmos recursos que a lei garante de fazer prova tem de haver um equil brio tamb m n o se pode a pretexto de garantir os direitos fundamentais impedir que regularmente pelo mesmo processo criminal o minist rio p blico possa fazer prova e comprovar a legitimidade das a es estamos tratando de algo que pede o equil brio de todos
1518626 o minist rio p blico embora seja organicamente estatal est funcionalmente mais vinculado sociedade essa conforma o reflexo da inter rela o entre esfera p blica e privada a institui o se move exclusivamente pelo princ pio da legalidade n o da legalidade burocr tica mas daquela que possui o atributo da constitucionalidade n o se trata de invadir compet ncias alheias nem de construir seu conceito pr prio de legalidade o minist rio p blico n o pol tico
1518627 em rela o ao caso espec fico da opera o satiagraha vazaram informa es e declara es do delegado encarregado prot genes queiroz que deixou o caso alegando falta de pessoal e press o dos superiores que s o contradit rias com essa falta de pessoal ele dizia que n o informava aos seus superiores sobre as condi es da opera o porque n o tinha confian a que eles iriam dar for a para a investiga o que ele estava fazendo como os superiores iriam saber se estava faltando pessoal insan vel essa contradi o tanto verdade que no momento em que o delegado saiu rapidamente se montou uma equipe de policiais que vieram de bras lia e de outros lugares foi repassado o inqu rito e ele est em andamento sem nenhuma espetacularidade se esse inqu rito eventualmente n o alcan ar as suas finalidades eu quero dizer que n o por falta de pessoal porque quem sabe teve ou poder ter algum v cio de origem mas quero dizer o seguinte as investiga es que est o sendo feitas j proporcionaram den ncia por suborno de delegado o trabalho est sendo feito muito bem feito com t cnica neutralidade e com foco isso que est sendo feito nesse caso da satiagraha
1518628 j conversei com o ministro da justi a fundamental que fa amos um pacto de combate corrup o e ao crime organizado necessariamente esse pacto envolver todos os agentes respons veis e que querem um brasil melhor
1518629 o minist rio p blico tamb m atende a essa sugest o quero lembrar minha fala inicial o compromisso do minist rio p blico com a dignidade humana n o apenas no foco da investiga o criminal o minist rio p blico atua firmemente respeitando seguramente os direitos da pessoa na atividade de investiga o criminal e desenvolve um trabalho extremamente produtivo e profundo em favor dos direitos de todas as ordens em favor dos cidad os todos t m conhecimento da atua o firme na defesa do meio ambiente da probidade administrativa dos ndios esse trabalho intenso e firme o trabalho tem de ser de conviv ncia de respeito
1518630 n s concordamos com a cria o de uma comiss o de alto n vel j estamos trabalhando nesse sentido com o ministro gilmar mendes o procurador geral da rep blica e a oab para uma segunda rodada de reformas
1518631 fundamental que fa amos aquilo que eu chamei de uma fuga pra frente
1518632 gostei das manifesta es do procurador e do ministro pelos direitos fundamentais temos institutos ultrapassados que devem ser adaptados
1518633 o di logo fluiu bem mas preciso ancor lo em projetos concretos a quest o da repress o ao abuso de autoridade um dos pontos principais
1518634 fundamental para que nossas diferen as sociais sejam extirpadas do nosso meio ter lado a lado o ministro da justi a e o presidente do stf
1518635 pela primeira vez eles sentaram e trocaram id ias ao menos elas est o convergentes o problema agora levar isso ao terreno da pr tica
1518636 preciso mostrar que nem sempre um juiz ou um promotor est certo e associar a busca pela verdade com a busca pela preserva o de direitos
1518637 discutir uma nova lei de abuso de autoridade como fizeram os debatedores talvez seja o caminho ideal para uma conseq ncia mais objetiva
1518638 um debate excelente e muito esclarecedor o ministro gilmar mendes se saiu muito bem e o estad o est de parab ns pela iniciativa
1518639 os debatedores mostraram que a fam lia forense tem diverg ncias e que a cria o de corregedorias de pol cia de extrema relev ncia
1518640 a constitui o est sendo vilipendiada em todo o pa s parece que h uma briga entre a primeira e a terceira inst ncia e isso ficou claro no debate
1518641 o di logo sempre fundamental ele se mostra muito mais necess rio medida que o problema se agrava justific vel estabelecer esse debate
1518642 a oab fez seu lobby o presidente britto colocou uma inverdade de que estar amos pr ximos de um estado policial

1518661 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee

1518665 joann mcfatter an issachar school instructor got into some stuff that seems kind of whacky to me and apparently chuck wasnt there in the room dna hold memory sins etc we can talk with animals then the plants have emotions that was the 2nd time id heard that in 2 months time when i heard that on the dvd are you guys getting a little out there or am i being stretched i trust chuck and robert absolutely implicitly i trust robert because chuck does however i can find nothing in scripture that says plants have emotions and we can talk with the animals true i find nothing in scripture on other things too but this i am questioning joann goes on to say when a word is released from a mouth in heaven comes a numeric equation music a color of light a fragrance huh then she says what new agers say fragrances have frequencies so tell me am i to believe what joann says if so then most of what the newagers say is right on then how do i tell the difference between what is godly and what is satanic joann mcfatter says the trees talked to her at a church the dvd blanked out where she said something about walking on water and how we can pass through a wall chuck pierce says sounds are connected with everything and every tabernacle how do i find out what sound is connected with me chuck pierce said when starting to talk on movement im sure joann has taught on this no she hadnt not at all joann tends to go on and on and on so what musical notes go with what essential oils joann mentioned something about it and if there is one note god tells me about say for coriander is that the same note worldwide or just for that person and who is to determine which notes go with what fragrances joann says colors heal so do non christians she says paintings heal and everyone has lots of creativity i knew that and am so glad someone else says it to back me up this dvd set skips and goes back and forth and blanks out when joann is talking mostly i think its totally irresponsible of glory of zion chuck pierce robert heidler and joann mcfatter to say all of the above and yet not explain anything to expect people to take what they say on face value without any explanations or reasonings just nothing

1518688 if spirit has any meaning it must be omnipresent or all pervading and all encompassing
1518689 furthermore it is not that spirit is present but you need to be
1518690 further if spirit has any meaning at all then it must be eternal or
1518691 rather spirit and enlightenment has to be something that you are fully aware of right now something you are already looking at right now we are all already looking directly at spirit we just dont recognize it we have all the necessary cognition but not the recognition

1518702 applying this methodology revealed that no road pays for itself in gas taxes and fees for example in houston the 15 miles of sh 99 from i 10 to us 290 will cost 1 billion to build and maintain over its lifetime while only generating 162 million in gas taxes that gives a tax gap ratio of 16 which means that the real gas tax rate people would need to pay on this segment of road to completely pay for it would be 2 22 per gallon this is just one example but there is not one road in texas that pays for itself based on the tax system of today some roads pay for about half their true cost but most roads we have analyzed pay for considerably less to conclude in the sh 99 example since the traffic volume for that road doesnt generate enough fuel tax revenue to pay for it revenues from other parts of the state must be used to build and maintain this corridor segment the same is true across the state meaning that as revealed by the tax gap analysis overall revenues are not sufficient to meet the states transportation needs

1518710 but the first championship match of the night was for the intercontinental championship as the champion kofi kingston was to defend against paul burchill burchill gave kingston a good run for the money but it was kingstons leg drop that gave him the three count and retaining his title but pauls hot and sexy sister came in the ring and distracted him which backfired as paul tried to attack him from the blind side and was tossed out of the ring katie lea tried distracting kingston a 2nd time but this time paul pulled him outside and the two started going at it then kingston chased him back to the locker room leaving katie lea in the ring by herself katie lea was involved in the 2nd title match of the night as she was taking on mickie james for the wwe womens championship james made another successful title defense but before she could leave the arena she was attacked from behind by the lady she won the title from a few months ago the glamazon beth phoenix who as of right now has a new boyfriend in santino marella marella and the glamazon confronted adamle about having title matches at summerslam so what does adamle do he makes a match pitting mickie james and kofi kingston against beth phoenix and santino marella the winning team win both the intercontinental and the wwe womens championship in one match santino and the glamazon need to put their feelings for each other on the side if they are going to win this match
1518711 layla was in the ring doing some ever so sexy dance moves only to be interuppted by william regal who called layla a tart earlier on wwe com layla told jamie noble that she does not associate with losers but that didnt stop him from rushing into the ring to defend laylas honor as he attacked regal which led to a heated brawl between the two that had to be broken up by wwe referees noble will do anything for the love of layla
1518712 then it was the 2 on 1 handicap match as john bradshaw layfield and chris jericho were taking on cm punk if jbl or y2j were to make the pin then that person will face cm punk at summerslam for the world heavyweight championship however adamle raised the stakes a little higher this match had a 10 minute time limit and if neither jbl or chris jericho were to make the pin then the world heavyweight championship match at summerslam will be a triple threat match jbl and y2j tried their hardest to get the pin but thanks to chris jericho who accidently knocked jbl onto cm punk in the final seconds of the match jbl got the pinfall and will be facing cm punk at summerslam for the world heavyweight championship something that chris jericho should have on his mind is what shawn micheals said last night about him going to the doctor two days before summerslam for an evaluation on his condition because the heartbreak kid will be at summerslam with news if his wrestling career is over or not lets hope and pray that shawn micheals can continue to wrestle even though we may not see him that much
1518713 then it was the big red machine kane taking on matt striker kane ran roughshod over the former high school teacher and after the match was over kane grabbed the mic and said he has been in a bad place as of late attacking wrestlers announcers and other wwe crew members he was then holding up his sack saying to the wwe universe he is dead and not coming back whatever is in that sack will be revealed next week on raw
1518714 then in the main event for the world tag team championship the champions ted dibiase and cody rhodes were to defend against john cena and batista the fierce animosity that was still there between the two leading up to their match at summerslam was still going on but thanks to a batista bomb onto dibiase he and cena overpowered the two and became the new world tag team champions even though cena and batista are the new world tag team champions its going to be interesting to see how this is going to play a part in their match at summerslam

1518722 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1518723 both paris and britney were millionaires by age 30 obama certainly was not
1518724 keep praying on your weegie boards while putting all your cynical little hopes in a poll
1518725 because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1518726 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1518727 i noticed that theres confusing now information from senator obama as to whether he actually supports off shore drilling or not
1518728 the fact is that we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to dill immediately

1518734 today compulsory national service refers to a system in which males undergo full time military training for up to two years just before they turn statutorily into adults and are subsequently called up annually for military training for up to 40 days each year for most of their adult life national service has in this way also become an important political instrument for disciplining and controlling the male population whose aggressive energies are redirected from political expression into military regimentation that focuses these energies onto the perceived external and sometimes internal enemies war or the imagined threat of war is after all one of the most fundamental organizing principles of any society

1518793 they very often are a presupposition of some other command and serve to distract the dominant hemisphere by having it utilize the internal dialog these imbedded questions are most effective when they are stacked together to maximally distract the dominant hemisphere imbedded commands serve the purpose of making suggestions to the client indirectly and thereby making it difficult to resist in any way these are most effective when they are also marked analogically by emphasizing the command and by looking intently at the listener if their eyes are open

1518812 where i come from families are important it was important for me to be with my sister as her son endured a slow and agonising death
1518813 during the last weeks he expressed remorse to me both for the problems he had caused for the family and others i visited my nephew in the hospice and i did attend his funeral
1518814 when i visited my nephew i was reminded of the fantastic jobs staff do in very emotional and difficult circumstances
1518815 i received a christmas card from him but was shocked to find a note in it saying that if i didnt give him money he would make sure my political opponents found out about him i couldnt believe it after all we had done for him i immediately took the note to the police and they dealt with it
1518816 prisoner derek hyslop serving an 11 year tariff was discharged officially on 20 april to royal devon and exeter hospital we do not discuss the case of individual prisoners

1518818 this is a significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1518819 it was an incredible moment when we realised the figures we were getting in they had not been previously recorded because these are remote areas inaccessible and tough to survey
1518820 if these census results are confirmed they are incredibly exciting the kind of good news we rarely find
1518821 the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent ebola can wipe out thousands in a short time
1518822 about one in three are in the critically endangered or endangered category which means they could disappear in the next five to ten years if we dont protect them
1518823 excuse me but theres a small black innocent and harmless bug running across the floor
1518824 shit theres a disease carrying man eating creepy crawly huge life threatening monster from the deep rushing toward me im going to die

1518826 yes i want an ice cream no i dont want an ice cream theyre good and bad im ambivalent i dont know
1518827 the mud went right into the kitchen and the bathroom at the back the roof had to be taken off and a new kitchen and bathroom put in
1518828 everybody has pulled together and there is no doubt it has helped bring the village together
1518829 the only downside is that we are still waiting to hear about the funding for the structural work to make sure it doesnt happen again
1518830 we need secure netting put up and some of the rocks removed i think it is highly likely it the landslides will happen again but when
1518831 we do really need a ditch on the top fields to drain away most of the water so it doesnt drain into the village
1518832 that was the recommendation from the engineers and that is what we are waiting for
1518833 we have had all this rain this summer and you could see the water pouring down the hill
1518834 it could be 200 or 300 years before it happens again but on the other hand it could be two or three years
1518835 nothing has been done we would certainly have hoped that the work to make the cliff safe would have started by now
1518836 those landslides made the earth move in more ways than one
1518837 the pennan inn may be closed but that doesnt mean we are dying a death here we still get lots of visitors
1518838 it has been a little bit quieter this year but thats not just happening in pennan its happening everywhere with the credit crunch
1518839 discussions about the long term protection measures are still ongoing
1518840 we hope to be able to appoint a contractor and approve the cost of the work to the village hall at a meeting of the banff and buchan area committee later this month and subsequently to begin work on the hall around the beginning of september
1518841 work to stabilise the slope took place last year as did remedial work to the village the longer term proposal is still a matter of discussion between aberdeenshire council and the scottish government
1518842 we will be giving full consideration to this case with a view to deciding whether to appeal
1518843 its a quite shocking sentence for a crime like this
1518844 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
1518845 the whale died at about 7 30pm we are hopeful that an autopsy can be carried out on wednesday so that the exact cause of death can be determined
1518846 it was clearly in a very poor physical and should not have been in these waters its important to try to establish exactly what has happened its a very big whale and will be difficult to move its now the responsibility of the local authority to decide what should happen to it
1518847 when such a huge animal strands it is very difficult to do anything to help it the whale may weigh over 40 tonnes
1518848 if the whale had not stranded and had seemed vigorous one option might have been to try very carefully to drive it towards the open sea and the rescue network had considered this
1518849 however driving a sick whale into deeper water might not have been kind and could have prolonged its suffering
1518850 the oil and gas industries are doing a lot at the moment with very little information
1518851 the purpose of the surveys is to understand what is out here but also to make the government take that on board
1518852 david has done what he set out to do to show very clearly that he is prepared to take on the leadership
1518853 it is not for him to bring down a prime minister and he does not know what will happen to gordon next that is for others to decide
1518854 but he wanted to make it very clear that he is up for this
1518855 if it comes to a contest putting alan milburn forward as a proposed chancellor would show everyone how serious about rescuing the labour party david is
1518856 senator barack obama has consistently opposed offshore drilling calling it a gimmick
1518857 but will his solution of simply inflating your tyres reduce the financial burden of high gas prices on your wallet
1518858 i liked the openness of it it was a refreshing change
1518859 the important thing is that they are here its not just the question and answer session which of course is limited its the coffee afterwards and the chance to meet and talk to ministers a lot can get done at that time too
1518860 it gives him a chance to clarify his ideas and to find out exactly where we are on all the current issues you have to be prepared
1518861 there are more and more good lunch offers available people wont stop eating out completely but they will be looking for value in the past no one really put any thought into set menus now chefs are using them to promote themselves
1518862 mcdonalds is well positioned to benefit from the current economic downturn lunch at places like pizza express may fall by the wayside as people will think i can go with the whole family to mcdonalds because its cheap and good value for money that is what people are looking for
1518863 people are no longer as loyal and want value for money but i dont think they are giving up on quality restaurants they just want better deals
1518864 we now expect to easily win that part of the electoral college
1518865 andy kerr s comments have angered many of the mps and the way iain has handled it has been far more diplomatic and conciliatory
1518866 i believe in a property tax and a reformed council tax would not lose council tax benefit
1518867 we must bring forward proposals for a fairer local tax working where possible with other opposition parties to fill the vacuum left by the snps incompetence on this issue
1518868 this is possibly the quickest u turn in scottish political history
1518869 his big idea has fallen apart at the first hurdle
1518870 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so
1518871 but it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places
1518872 theres no doubt that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when this problem first arose
1518873 the prime minister when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do
1518874 i believe we can win the next election provided we discover the same zeal and enthusiasm that we had in 1997 2001 and 2005
1518875 comparing the dpj to the nazis is a verbal abuse that completely lacks common sense we demand a retraction of course
1518876 i only tried to raise a question about the absence of proper discussion in the upper house i was trying to explain that there have been many such cases in the past after parliamentary discussions were boycotted
1518877 there were similar cases before the second world war and thats what i used as an example
1518878 in the past germany invited tragedy by letting the nazis take power
1518879 it would be verging on the criminal to allow the built heritage to drift away
1518880 i suspect many of you will express astonishment at the number of these remarkable buildings dotted over this remarkable landscape
1518881 i happen to believe in the enormous economic and social potential of bringing back to life buildings which have so long lain dormant
1518882 it is a unique heritage because they are unlike buildings in any other part of scotland because of the nature of the materials used and the way they were used by local builders who had high levels of skills and craftsmanship
1518883 many of these buildings are not listed by historic scotland and one of the purposes of the survey and the accompanying report is to draw widespread attention to the value of the built heritage which isnt protected many of these buildings are at risk and if we dont move fairly quickly what you would be left with are mounds of stone
1518884 the report identifies those features which are unique to the area
1518885 the vernacular heritage in caithness is unique is a diminishing resource and is currently at considerable risk
1518886 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1518887 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1518888 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1518889 this is nothing but propaganda direct from south africa probably coming from someone like the press spokesman for thabo mbeki the south african president
1518890 south africa wants everyone to believe that a deal is imminent and is giving off the record briefings to that effect
1518891 so far zanu pf and the mdc have been discussing non controversial issues but now they have moved on to the real sticking point as to who will wield what power
1518892 robert mugabe is saying he wants morgan tsvangirai as prime minister with no power
1518893 but tsvangirai is talking about a transitional arrangement for two years only when an election will be held and whoever wins the election rules the country
1518894 he wants mugabe to be in a ceremonial role where he would just be kissing babies opening parliament meeting heads of state at the airport and dishing out medals
1518895 tsvangirai wants to be in charge of key ministries like defence home affairs justice and finance
1518896 but i am not hopeful mugabe is likely to accept that he has to be forced out mbeki has to tell him that the game is up
1518897 i think the numbers will probably be found to be higher
1518898 people are likely to find more cases when they look partly through increased testing and partly because people who you hadnt thought were a case have actually become one when you look more closely
1518899 what we need to do with c difficile is for the government and nhs to concentrate on measures that work to help get rid of it
1518900 what that means is ensuring that people wash their hands and rather than just blaming the staff look at the clinical areas and make sure there are enough sinks close to patients
1518901 without outside help poland could have trouble retaining auschwitz as a memorial site
1518902 the cells status was bad as they had been stored for a long time so we cautiously approached the work
1518903 edinburgh fringe is incredibly important for all actors i think simon callow is here which shows you how big edinburghs reputation is because he is the ultimate actor
1518904 my sister sarah picked me up from the station in her panto cow costume this morning how many places does that happen to you
1518905 its really nice up here there are lovely people and we have great fun at work
1518906 we are confident and capable of holding a safe olympic games under the leadership of the chinese government and with the help of the international community
1518907 it will be too much to let it go for them its a once in a lifetime opportunity to hit the people they regard as oppressors
1518908 there is a lot of anger and hatred and it would draw attention to their cause and hurt the people they regard as oppressors
1518909 the majority of the money accounts for permanent infrastructure stuff that we think long term will be productive for the chinese economy
1518910 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1518911 i thought it a little odd and then i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddie but a longer name she could have said madeleine
1518912 he then realised the man was staring fixedly at the area in question very focused on what he was doing and did not notice flacks presence
1518913 he concluded that the man was monitoring the movements near that path and into the apartment the man looked suspicious he was watching the apartment
1518914 i was really worried about my english because i found literature quite difficult
1518915 but when i opened the envelope it was a pretty sweet feeling
1518916 i got my results through text about five past eight this morning i got five as but i wasnt expecting it because i didnt do anywhere near as well as that in the prelims
1518917 i found english quite difficult i thought it was quite an awkward paper this year
1518918 i was so thrilled this morning when i got the results it was a nice way to start the day i was really worried about english and i knew i needed all as to study medicine
1518919 im going to study advanced maths chemistry and physics next year and ill have to do a crash course in biology
1518920 it has been a lot of hard work and now i am just looking forward to a break
1518921 weve had excellent results which has shown the robust strong scottish education system
1518922 we have seen a small increase in the percentage of passes this time and i think that reflects the hard work that the candidates have been putting in and also the work of the teachers and others who have been supporting the students in terms of getting their qualifications
1518923 i dont think the exams have become any easier in the last few years as such although i dont think theres any doubt they are easier than they were 20 or 30 years ago in terms of the questions that are being set
1518924 there have been small percentage increases over the last few years in the main subjects
1518925 however i think that is as a result of teachers becoming much more comfortable with the exam system and we are seeing more of the right kind of teaching that produces the best results
1518926 the sqa has run lots more training courses over the last few years and teachers are becoming more adept in knowing what they are looking for
1518927 i dont think there has been any dumbing down of exams but we do definitely need to look at whether the current crop of examinations are fit for purpose which i dont think they are
1518928 there needs to be a radical look at the entire examination system
1518929 dogs have amazing capacity to read and react to human social and communicative cues which is thought to have evolved over last 15 000 years
1518930 the uk may be entering choppy economic waters but we are more recession resistant than many and can offer excellent career progression
1518931 we have spent the last year trying to align our work and activities in north america with that of the new government this has not proved possible

1518954 were in an environment when the banks are getting it from all sides
1518955 consumers are defaulting a little more than usual but also using their credit more than usual
1518956 that doesnt feel like a situation thats getting better it feels like they are being picked on
1518957 card issuers are viewing risk differently now than they did just a year or two ago
1518958 making your payments on time is no longer enough to be considered a good credit risk you have to keep your balances low relative to your available credit and be chipping away at that balance rather than skating by on minimum payments
1518959 between the sub prime crisis the housing market the economy and the fact that a lot of people are living off of their credit cards the banks are trying to immunize themselves against the point in time when more people will not be able to keep up with their credit card payments weve seen a lot of complaints from consumers who had been cardholders for years and had always paid on time and thought it would count for something but who have now seen their credit limit cut
1518960 but if i saw my credit line being cut id call and throw a hissy fit about it because you have no chance of seeing it readjusted without that you can shop around for other deals but that could be tough given your circumstances so start by talking to your card company they may be looking at everybody and deciding if theyre still a good risk but they still dont want to lose you as a customer
1518961 pay the bills on time be a good user of credit if you have to use credit and stand up for yourself if there are changes made that you dont think should have happened to you if you dont stand up for yourself you know the credit card companies will be doing whats best for themselves and not for you
1518962 its that focus on companies with quality assets quality management teams quality balance sheets with better than average growth prospects that keep us in that position
1518963 the u s single family housing market is like a game of musical chairs and i dont want to be around when the music stops
1518964 there will be a time when we will consider homebuilders again
1518965 people are saying what on earth are you doing buying office companies in midtown manhattan
1518966 theres a bit of a disconnect in investor sentiment compared to what were seeing in terms of reality on the fundamental level
1518967 youre really participating in national markets with a slight bend to markers we like a little bit better than average
1518968 they have a very good management team a very good balance sheet and will grow cash flow significantly over the years
1518969 a copa sulamericana um torneio cada vez mais importante e esta vers o tem a particularidade de enfrentar in meros argentinos na primeira fase creio que os jogos v o resultar em encontros atrativos
1518970 s o duas equipes que tem conseguido muitos t tulos internacionais e sem d vida temos que respeitar suas trajetorias

1518974 neste caso temos de ajudar a pessoa o ser humano e me parece que se n o se encara a situa o por esse lado estamos todos equivocados
1518975 i helped us win x account which brought in more than 3 million in incremental revenue in addition i will be managing a team of 20 this year so i believe i have earned a raise of 20 000

1518977 lori as you know ive been a critical member of our team in the past year ive solely managed the x account eliminated our billing discrepancies and filled in for two employees on maternity leave i think youd agree that i deserve a raise
1518978 we are thrilled beyond measure to be partnering again with the advertising club of new york american advertising federation american association of advertising agencies and arnold worldwide on the 2nd annual adcolor awards
1518979 everyone involved in bringing this effort to fruition from sponsors to coalition members to nominators and many others shares in the collective responsibility to propel the media marketing and advertising industries forward in the area of diversity
1518980 the level of enthusiasm expressed by those familiar with and new to this years adcolor awards is both astounding and humbling
1518981 we eagerly anticipate a tremendous response to the call for nominations and look forward to honoring the second wave of outstanding professionals of color who are so deserving of this recognition
1518982 you know when people use plastic bags and they just throw them out sea life just sees them floating by and they just swallow them
1518983 wow they are really cool bags and i said thats it thats what we should call them
1518984 i dont want this to go bad when i get home im gonna put this in the perishable bag
1518985 these can keep the groceries cool for up to three hours
1518986 so you can go in one straight line who knows maybe the grocery store is in the middle of your errand run

1518988 the purpose for me wanting to take him steve thompson up to stanley along with austin and mike was those were my three upper class men boys that were rock solid they were my leaders
1518989 for five or six days after the accident i really have no memory i can remember being here in icu
1518990 it was so inspiring to have a young man like that in our group
1518991 i really want to go back to centennial and get things going
1518992 and he said no and no with a little bit of pride i thought
1518993 a blog is written by interested amateur writers who dont get paid and probably dont have a journalism degree
1518994 some people are very civil and good about being able to talk about issues without injecting that kind of thing
1518995 i had to laugh when i heard campaign manager jason risch use that term
1518996 im a mild mannered middle aged woman who does this in my spare time to help get democrats get elected
1518997 for example ive raised over 170 000 helped by bloggers who spread the word about my campaign
1518998 were being taken more seriously by the media and by politicians
1518999 if youre not aware of them as a form of communication then youre behind the curve
1519000 they are real now theyre part of the political game
1519001 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1519002 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy
1519003 but then that wrinkly white guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1519004 why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
1519005 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
1519006 im paris hilton and i approve this message cause i think its totally hot
1519007 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1519008 as it is popularly called is the stunning centerpiece to the 2008 games

1519015 my girlfriend makes me laugh and we never get bored well drive in the car and be goofballs together and i enjoy that
1519016 one reason why i didnt dance tonight is because i cant dance with those kids theyre unbelievable
1519017 but i think i chose the m amp m crew just simply because i just wanted to get back at the
1519018 i have an idea for a tv show you could have taken teens who are pregnant and documented the stresses of their daily life
1519019 this is the problem you people who are critics of the show do not understand what the demands of television are if we put one of the concepts that my peers came up with on television it would be great and safe and make a point but have zero viewers
1519020 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting

1519025 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1519026 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on
1519027 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

1519074 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1519075 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1519076 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team

1519094 the hpv vaccination programme is not about being sexually active its not encouraging young people to be sexually active
1519095 it is a preventative vaccine so that when certain young people become sexually active and perhaps have more than one partner then its a way of acting as protection against cervical cancer
1519096 it does not mean that women do not go ahead and have cervical smears it just means its an extra form of protection
1519097 young people felt that they wanted a place one place to go where they could access information and advice on various things rather than going to different places

1519109 the u s governments response to the most serious health crisis facing black america remains timid and lethargic
1519110 theyre hypersensitive to a potential terrorist attack my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1519111 weve been told that if we make trouble our names will be blacklisted and our phones bugged

1519118 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1519119 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1519120 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1519121 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1519122 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution
1519123 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1519124 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues

1519156 the old rules of entertaining just dont apply any more
1519157 dont take on the task of playing both roles baker and chef for the same event in the limited time you have in your own kitchen
1519158 people are understanding that its about having people come to your house and enjoy spending time together not so much about having perfectly matching silver and perfectly matching plates
1519159 what do you think you are a freakin rock star
1519160 without a doubt the mightiest thought the mind can entertain is the word of god and the weightiest word in any language is the word for god thought and speech are gods gifts to creatures made in his image these are intimately associated with him and impossible apart from him it is highly significant that the first word was the word and the word was with god and the word was god we may speak because god spoke in him word and idea are indivisible
1519161 id do anything for love but i wont do that
1519162 it is mysterious and dark and places a picture in the listeners mind
1519163 wed gotten to a point that if something didnt change we wouldnt have been able to make a second record
1519164 were actually high on the christian charts and im like what the f k are we even doing there
1519165 we hope to express in our music that christianity is not a rigid list of rules to follow
1519166 the message we as a band want to convey more than anything is simple god is love
1519167 they clearly understood the album would be sold in these christian music channels
1519168 it was never the title of the album more a spoof or joke
1519169 we love bands like queen where its huge and majestic but also bands like black flag and the misfits who would go absolutely crazy
1519170 on the first record i created a world then hid behind it
1519171 with a beautiful lie it was time to take a more personal and less cerebral approach although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head its about brutal honesty growth change its an incredibly intimate look into a life that is in the crossroads a raw emotional journey a story of life love death pain joy and passion of what it is to be human
1519172 we wanted to focus on the insides of the song
1519173 to cut away anything extraneous to get to the truth of it all for us it wasnt about how much we could do but about how little that was the beginning of a lot of challenges i worked hard to create something very special and different the first time around sonically and conceptually and that first cd will always be that no matter what but in order to move forward you have to leave some things behind that was not always the easiest thing to do in some ways it was the birth of something new and the death of something old
1519174 we needed this album to be something that re set the bar for us
1519175 as proud as we are of our previous efforts i really wanted to destroy the first record by making a second one the last thing we wanted to do was make the same record twice
1519176 it was important for it to be emotionally accessible and also stripped down and raw
1519177 we needed this record to sound really genuine and honest
1519178 there were a lot of intense changes taking place for us during the making of this project personally and artistically
1519179 change was an important theme this time around and you can feel it however as dark and reflective as some of the moments on this cd can be there is always a huge sense of optimism and celebration it was a battle and in a way its about going to war going to war with yourself and winning
1519180 any time you have a precedent thats negative like that youre gonna have an uphill battle
1519181 when we toured for the last album we were going to war every night
1519182 we played well over 300 shows and eventually we won that battle now that weve accomplished that this record was more about us continuing to grow and make really great songs
1519183 i was living in this house overlooking the ocean and it was breathtakingly beautiful
1519184 but amidst all of this there was an overwhelming amount of contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destruction of man i saw this a lot as i traveled the world from asia to europe and at home it made me think about these contradictions in life the choices we make to believe in something at the cost of something else whether its being in a relationship or going to war but theres something incredibly inspiring optimistic and romantic about making those choices especially considering that no matter what we all collectively choose to keep moving forward
1519185 at first we werent really sure what our role was gonna be
1519186 it was a little strange to have other people involved in the process because i can be very protective of the music
1519187 in the past it was very difficult for me to let other people participate because it was such a special private and personal experience for my brother and i now for the first time we have a group of four people who have the same vision share the same tastes and dreams and its amazing because we all work so well together
1519188 im very methodical and obsessive and will beat something to death to get something right and josh isnt like that at all
1519189 he likes to keep things organic he doesnt over think or overdo anything which helped keep things sounding spontaneous
1519190 i had worked on that song from morocco to thailand to la and it always worked when i played it by myself on acoustic guitar but for some reason we couldnt bring the song to life with the band so i tossed it
1519191 then one night i was sitting outside with my acoustic guitar and josh abraham walked out as a joke i said very sarcastically hey you wanna hear a hit song and i started playing attack on the acoustic after the first chorus he stopped me and said thats the best song you have we have to record that now its our first single
1519192 change was an important theme for all of us this time around and a cycle that everyone goes through many times in their lives
1519193 i wanted each song to be like a chapter in a book together they add up to make the story but individually every chapter has to have its own color its own expression its own personality
1519194 oh it was fine i had a tough couple of drives

1519225 no one else like michael mack period no one has ever told you the truth about money credit debt and wealth until now
1519226 michael mack helped my wife and turn our lives around when we had to file for bankruptcy we pretty much gave up on getting credit again we had no clue what to do or where to turn then we got one of michaels goofy letters in the mail what michael taught us was shocking but it turned our lives around almost overnight so i have free advice to give you if you have a chance to talk with michael mack do it now do not wait do whatever it takes to get into his office and hear what he has to say listen closely take notes and prepare to become credit rich and debt free if you have a chance to work with him do it michael mack is very selective about the people he works with but if he decides to work with you you wont get double talk and excuses michael mack is a no b s fellow he keeps his family of clients informed he listens and he fights tooth and nail for the middle class the people with credit problems or debt issues and the working people and senior citizens who need help the most
1519227 how to eliminate credit card debt for pennies on the dollar and pay only a fraction of what is legally owed little known legal loophole revealed
1519228 i was skeptical when i first heard through some friends about michael mack it was hard to believe that this man had a proven patented system where he could do more than just consolidate my debt any mortgage broker or credit counselor can do that but i was told that michael could do much more than what mortgage brokers credit counselors and bankruptcy lawyers could do i was told that he also had the ability to negotiate with credit card companies banks and other creditors and get thousands of dollars in debt actually forgiven how can this be possible i asked myself
1519229 call me skeptical but that seemed way too good to be true well imagine my surprise when almost immediately after hiring michael i received confirmation that he had settled with my chase account for a 65 savings of 3 745 71 then he convinced bank one to forgive 8 128 46 of my debt then he settled my discover card for over 50 savings it felt like i had been handed a check a gift of thousands of dollars to pay off my debt
1519230 in a very short time i became a true believer instead of having to consolidate the full amount of my debt i borrowed less than the full amount of my debt because mike negotiated dime on the dollar payments faced with a choice between borrowing the full amount i owe or borrowing less than what i owe by legally paying a fraction of what i owe the choice is obvious
1519231 mike is the consumate professional he and his staff treated me with respect and dignity at all times they returned phone calls the same day and in my opinion they know how to do things for people that no other mortgage broker can do
1519232 tricks your mortgage company your bank your credit card company and your finance company are not telling you about

1519234 altmire continues to hold news conferences and issue statements purporting to support utilization of more coal however he has failed to match his actions with his rhetoric it has become a regular event for altmire to pay lip service to a popular issue only to refuse to act on it he continues be in lock step with his washington d c leaders who oppose coal to liquid technology and refuse to schedule a vote on the house floor to move this technology forward to commercial use
1519235 the discharge petition process is obviously not the normal route to getting an important issue to the house floor for up or down vote however jasons chosen speaker of the house nancy pelosi has left few options since she continues to manipulate the voting schedule to prevent energy legislation from being considered with altmires support she has even cancelled committee meetings to avoid votes to open new areas to exploration altmire should sign the discharge petitions to bring this and other energy legislation to the house floor its long overdue that altmire stand up for the best interests of his district and not san francisco

1519300 you should reveal everything to this woman then only your liberation would become possible
1519301 youre that blogging guy italian wine terry strappo mimmo hughes oh i know who you are
1519302 no no joe nothing like that its just that you see your regular readers hit the site and you feel good its like theres some channel of communication even though youve never met them in person you begin to wonder who they are what they look like what they do what wines they like best what their favorite music is their favorite color
1519303 what theyre wearing who they love what excites them what makes them feel alive
1519304 im an addict im in a 12 step now wba wine blog addicts i started out reading one or two blogs you know just out of a general interest in wine reviews mostly light stuff i was happy then id go to the store and get a bottle of 12 shiraz that someone gave a 92 and it was nice it worked i learned some stuff and didnt spend much time on the blogs 10 15 minutes a day on all of them
1519305 but then i wanted more you always do i guess
1519306 i found i loved the rage the emotional range the topicality i loved it made me feel smart to read it and on and on it went after a while i was up to 50 60 wine blogs a day i even tried to read the
1519307 i read more and more even more on weekends id go through a hundred 150 thats when id catch up with the new blogs id go through everyones blogroll looking for new thrills for bloggers who were out there more and more out there outrageous people who were willing to put themselves on the line they fascinated me they riffed on wine but it wasnt about wine it was about the turmoil in their souls their broken hearts and dreams
1519308 i found your cursed blog terry it was the doorway to hell
1519309 one night when i had drunk a little too much i read one of your posts
1519310 so funny too because it wasnt even about wine it was entitled rum and me do you remember
1519311 i remember joe im glad you liked it that one meant a great deal to me
1519312 it meant a lot to me too then i read another one
1519313 there were others they meant a great deal to me too i i got to the point where i couldnt leave the computer i waited for you to post i wanted to know what was going through your mind what was hurting or angering you i felt as though my personality was sinking into yours blending while i waited for you to post i read other blogs and i got more and more into them too their worlds their lives i wanted to fade away to escape from the prison of my own personality escape my horrible life as a divorced tolltaker on the turnpike i wanted to go to far away places and drink all sorts of interesting wine and eat great food just like you even if it just meant bitching about them
1519314 you were the one i felt closest to i still do
1519315 it should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
1519316 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me serves as the slogan for the group founded by mara vanderslice the former director of religious outreach for the kerry edwards 2004 campaign
1519317 as christians we find john mccains recent ad the one incredibly offensive
1519318 this ad tries to portray senator obama as some kind of messiah and mocks those who support him as cult like followers looking for a new savior even more troubling many view the ad as a dark attempt to portray senator obama as an anti christ figure
1519319 instead of seeking to inspire false fears we would prefer you speak more positively about how your own faith would guide you in leading this country
1519320 we trust that this desperate and insulting campaign tactic is not an indication of your true character and we call on you to repudiate this ad and take it down immediately
1519321 refrain from texting and the use of bluetooth wireless devices

1519324 if you see a kid not giving one hundred percent or talking or goofing off send them off to run a lap
1519325 youll wear the whistle around your neck and youll get to casually sip from a great big sixty four ounce soda while your classmates are sweating in the hot sun
1519326 all you have to do in order to be that person for a day is to push yourself and try your hardest if i think youre really giving it everything youve got you get to be the coach for a day

1519359 van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1519360 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1519361 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1519362 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1519363 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors

1519387 the world has stood stunned amazed delighted and wonder struck
1519388 w atching america the tyrannical watching its legions breaking apart under your strikes its brigades being wiped out in front of your raids and its battalions being obliterated by the pounding of your squadrons o people of iraq o eminent ones of the turks kurds and arabs the affair of unbelief the u s occupation has been shaken and confused and the time of his fleeing is nigh so increase his confusion and disarray and strike some more at his neck and hit it with a bone cutting sword the bearer of the banner of the cross has increased his soldiers and claimed that he will defeat the soldiers of faith so be resolute may allah be merciful to you and remember him much for he is watching you you have done well by carrying out one of the greatest of duties which few carry out repelling the attacking enemy
1519389 but some of you have been tardy in performing another duty which is also among the greatest of duties combining your ranks to make them one rank as loved by allah who said truly allah loves those who fight in his cause in ranks as if they were a solid cemented structure
1519390 to fill the void stemming from the departure of the americans immediately upon their exit and before un islamic forces attempt to fill the void
1519391 the full magnitude of the infidel conspiracies being hatched against you
1519392 infidelity on all its levels international regional and local is combining to prevent the establishment of the state of islam
1519393 and the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him said observe the group and avoid factionalism for satan is with the loner and farther away from the pair whoever wants the comfort of the garden must stay with the group sticks refuse to break when banded together but if they come apart they break one by one my brothers the amirs of the mujahid groups in iraq the muslims are waiting for you to gather under one banner to enforce truth and when you carry out this act of obedience to god the ummah will enjoy the birth year of the group and how it longs for this year and perhaps it will come soon at your hands so seek may allah have mercy on you to carry out this great lost obligation
1519394 engender reconciliation between every two parties in dispute and they must judge between them according to the law of allah
1519395 in the absence of this popular support the islamic mujahid movement would be crushed in the shadows our planning must strive to involve the muslim masses in the battle and to bring the mujahid movement to the masses and not to conduct the struggle far from them
1519396 beware of your enemies especially the hypocrites who infiltrate your ranks to stir up trouble among mujahid groups
1519397 i advise myself and the muslims in general and the brothers in the al qaeda organization everywhere in particular to beware of fanatical partiality to men groups and homelands the truth is what allah the most high said and what the messenger peace and blessings of allah be upon him said and everyones statement is to be accepted or rejected except the messengers peace and blessings of allah be upon him his order is to be accepted with pleasure
1519398 fight in the cause of god those who fight you but do not transgress the limits for god loveth not transgressors
1519399 in a believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant it is they who have transgressed all bounds
1519400 advice regarding the conduct of jihadist action in egypt and the world
1519401 this new document is not addressed to one particular group and does not criticize any particular party it is a collection of rules to help jihadists avoid violating shariaa during their conduct of jihad
1519402 it is not permissible to reject this document on the grounds that it was written in jail or by claiming that a captive has no authority over others i do not pretend to have authority over anyone i am not requiring anyone to accept my view in the name of obedience to the leader this leadership does not exist i am not pretending to be qualified to issue religious edicts or that i am deducing new rules of jurisprudence i am merely a transmitter of religious knowledge there is a form of obedience that is greater than the obedience accorded to any leader namely obedience to god and his messenger god says if ye have a dispute over a certain matter consult what god and the prophet say what shariaa requires us to do takes precedence over any human covenant
1519403 the place where the document was written has no importance what is important is the proof on which the document rests gods prophet yusuf gave advice to gods people while he was imprisoned sheikh al islam ibn taymiyah composed many of his writings while imprisoned in the fortress of damascus was their imprisonment used as a pretext to reject their advice as i said the important thing is the proof on which the document rests not where it was written if there is anything in what i wrote that contradicts the true rules of shariaa i will take it back and adhere to the proofs of shariaa no one may attribute to me any statement other than those that i included in this document
1519404 we continue to believe that there are no comprehensive or reliable figures for deaths since march 2003
1519405 tried and tested way of measuring mortality in conflict zones
1519406 we had only three or four deaths in a month from cancer now its 30 to 35 patients dying every month our studies indicate that 40 to 48 per cent of the population in this area will get cancer
1519407 genocidal practically an entire nation was subjected to poverty death and destruction of its physical and mental foundations
1519408 requested radiotherapy equipment chemotherapy drugs and analgesics are consistently blocked by united states and british advisers to the sanctions committee
1519409 are capable of being used in weapons of mass destruction
1519410 the mortality of children in basra has increased by nearly 30 per cent compared to the saddam hussein era
1519411 children are dying daily and no one is doing anything to help them
1519412 you got to keep repeating things over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
1519413 said they would be able to take baghdad without a bloodbath and that in the end the iraqis would be celebrating and on both of those points he has been proved conclusively right and it would be entirely ungracious even for his critics not to acknowledge that tonight he stands as a larger man and a stronger prime minister as a result
1519414 when the use of force is both right and sensible
1519415 that the foreign fighters are a couple per cent and then theyre sort of leaderless
1519416 the scholars were divided on the use of verses from the quran as mobile telephone ringtones
1519417 to what cave can allah escape covered with dust smoke and flames
1519418 literary passages thereby no ruling can be made upon a person based upon these quotes
1519419 freedom of speech necessitates no takfir of people therefore we must surrender their condition to their creator
1519420 the blood of the muslim is not permitted except in three cases the adulterer the killer for his killing and he who abandons his religion leaving the muslim community
1519421 i will not sit until he is killed this is the rule of allah and his messenger
1519422 if you were to ask them they will say we were only jesting and joking
1519423 then we gave the scripture as an inheritance to those we had chosen among our worshippers but some among them wrong their own souls some are halfhearted and some by allahs leave are foremost in good deeds that is the highest grace
1519424 gardens of eternity will they enter therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments there will be of silk and they will say praise be to allah who has removed from us all sorrow for our lord is indeed oft forgiving gracious
1519425 praise be to allah who has removed from us all sorrow
1519426 a person does not commit adultery while he is a believer
1519427 the human heart is more swift to commotion that a pot of water when it is set to boil
1519428 some who wrong their own souls some who are halfhearted and some who are by allahs leave foremost in good deeds
1519429 indeed the best of you with allah are the most pious among you
1519430 also sheikh osama how can you preach to the american people to join islam when you boldly acknowledge that you are behind the killing of thousands of them in 9 11 dont you think that this will arouse in them revulsion towards islam you must either call on them to join islam by making them to want to with beautiful words or you must fight them but when you declare war against them and fight them and at the same time preach to them to join islam these two things do not sit well with each other moreover they will only increase the americans hostility towards the muslims their hatred of islam and their revulsion towards it
1519431 sheikh osama what the organization called al qaeda has carried out in iraq is mixing together jihad against the occupation with operations for kidnapping killing and bombing public places and harming worshippers of god shiite and sunni civilians alike when even imams of mosques and preachers have not been spared in the operations carried out by those belonging to al qaeda in iraq these operations strike civilians and harm the image of jihad and of the resistance in iraq against the occupation
1519432 i ask sheikh osama and i say to him the line that you are taking has harmed islamic activity and the spread of islam across the world why then do you not reexamine your policy and your plans why do you not consult with the reliable clerics and men of prudence and wisdom in the islamic world because the consequences of your actions affect not only you and your followers and aides why do you act alone of your own accord and drag the muslim nation to an unknown fate because of your isolationist views and behavior why was there no consultation with prudent men and thinkers on the matter of al qaeda operations so that they could learn whether your deeds are correct or mistaken how will you be able to rectify the mistakes and again advance the nation
1519433 finally i wish to ask sheikh osama about his view of the operations by some groups belonging to al qaeda that carry out random bombings and whose victims are innocent people some of whom are muslim are these groups connected to you are you pleased with their behavior and their operations
1519434 i would like for sheikh osama to tell us and we would appreciate this regarding an al qaeda group in the maghreb states that is perpetrating various bombings the victims of which are innocent people mostly or all muslims
1519435 if the answer is yes then what is the logic of bombing here and killing there
1519436 so fight your desires at a time when you can eat the soul is never satisfied satisfying your desires is like satisfying the thirsty person who went to drink water from the sea the more he drinks the thirstier he gets since the water is salty
1519437 my soul longed for some meat and i want to go buy some meat with a dirham
1519438 o jabir whenever you have the desire for something you go out and buy it
1519439 i am afraid that it would be said to me on the day of judgement
1519440 michael darda of mkm partners notes that while bank stocks
1519441 if youre like many investors you look at the falling price
1519442 it is always a mistake to sell because of a decline in price why because price by itself is meaningless price drives perception if the price goes down something must be wrong sell the stock if the price goes up enthusiasm follows buy the stock
1519443 well you might as well work in the hospital and be a candy striper

1519446 no tener ninguna duda que ser el pr ximo presidente de chile
1519447 en lo personal creo que ser a un error llevar un candidato propio yo soy de la udi y tengo que respetar las decisiones pero creo que ser a un error yo no estoy por esa iniciativa cu ndo lo proclamen eso es un tema de la directiva y yo ah paso
1519448 llamamos a todos los dirigentes a asumir con responsabilidad sus intervenciones ante la prensa en especial en temas en los cuales existen acuerdos vigentes adoptados por rganos de nuestra colectividad los cuales son sensibles para la unidad
1519449 estamos ciertos que la prudencia y el respeto de nuestra institucionalidad partidaria ayudar n tanto al bien del partido como al buen xito de la alianza en las pr ximas elecciones presidenciales
1519450 la udi defini un itinerario institucional y debe ser respetado lo l gico es no adelantarse en proclamaciones dado que las municipales pueden modificar el escenario pol tico actual
1519451 hay un itinerario presidencial que hay que cumplir de hecho puede haber otra situaci n de aqu al t rmino del proceso municipal
1519452 en estos momentos lo que se requiere es reciprocidad y trabajo en conjunto insisto el escenario es variable donde la fecha de la nominaci n de sebasti n pi era o de la elecci n de nuestro candidato es un criterio que el partido debe definir aunque esto tiene que ver con una lectura de la situaci n del momento y no se trata de factores rom nticos o de ganarse nuestro amor
1519453 eso todav a no se decide pero es muy claro que as como hay algunos a los que les conviene tomarse la foto con pi era no a todos los candidatos les conviene sac rselas con l
1519454 me la voy a sacar con sebasti n pi era sin ning n problema
1519455 dime con quien te fotograf as y te dir qui n eres
1519456 tiene el coraz n de la udi bastante conquistado hay muchos alcaldes y concejales que quieren participar con l en su franja electoral y tomarse fotos pronto
1519457 lo nico que falta es juntar nuestros tiempos para trabajar en conjunto pero de verdad y en serio
1519458 si tuvi ramos un buen candidato tendr amos todo el derecho a competir pero como no es el caso debemos sumarnos a la candidatura de sebasti n
1519459 no hay mucha diferencia entre hacerlo en noviembre o en abril
1519460 as como rn tuvo generosidad con joaqu n lav n en su momento si la udi no tiene un candidato que contribuya a obtener m s apoyo para la alianza definitivamente tenemos que apoyar a la alianza
1519461 no es un drama o un desastre no tener un candidato propio y no podemos desperdiciar de nuevo la posibilidad de ganar no quiero esperar otros 20 a os para ser gobierno

1519466 ryan grant and brandon jackson seemed to split carries with the first team but grant appeared to be 1a
1519467 he looked decent seems a bit bigger than the end of last season and took a few good hits including one from nick barnett grant did have a touchdown where he fought through a few tackles
1519468 it wasnt all bad for rodgers however during the red zone drill
1519469 he lofted a nifty touchdown pass to james jones who made a spectacular one handed grab to the delight of cheering fans
1519470 i told you my daughter was missing for a month i just found her today but i cant find my granddaughter she just admitted to me that shes been trying to find her herself theres something wrong i found my daughters car today and it smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car
1519471 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1519472 twitter is a service for friends family and co workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question what are you doing

1519495 during the innumerable past ages i have wandered through a multiplicity of existences all the while giving myself to unimportant details of life at the expense of essentials and thus creating infinite occasions for hate ill will and wrongdoing while no violations have been committed in this life the fruits of evil deeds in the past are to be gathered now neither gods nor men can foretell what is coming upon me i will submit myself willingly and patiently to all the ills that befall me and i will never bemoan or complain the sutra teaches me not to worry over ills that may happen to me why because when things are surveyed by a higher intelligence the foundation of causation is reached

1519543 il successo non esiste il fatto di averlo qualcosa che dicono gli altri per me non cambiato niente anzi quando vedo la mia foto sul giornale vedo unaltra persona
1519544 qualcosa che mi piace o qualcosa che mi fa star male io la devo scrivere
1519545 ci sono alcuni che sostengono che il mestiere di editore sia dannoso perch si frappone nel rapporto diretto tra autore e pubblico
1519546 questa dice la negazione del ruolo di intermediazione e di scelta delleditore

1519548 uno scrittore deve raccontare quello che conosce bene quello contro cui andato a sbattere
1519549 deve seguire il suo istinto e pulire il suo sguardo un compito che rischia di schiacciarlo perch deve levarsi dagli occhi quello che viene dalla televisione dal cinema c il rischio che il suo libro diventi lamplificazione di una linea politica o di una visione della vita che pu anche essere giusta ma questo non ha mai prodotto grandi libri

1519552 la presenza del pubblico ha dichiarato salvatore lai sindaco del paese un atto di solidariet nei confronti della comunit per un fatto tragico che non abbiamo intenzione di rimuovere
1519553 aku datang ke mari sebagai seorang pengacara muda yang ingin menegakkan keadilan di negeri yang sedang kacau ini
1519554 ya kepada kamu bukan sebagai putraku tetapi kamu sebagai ujung tombak pencarian keadilan di negeri yang sedang dicabik cabik korupsi ini
1519555 tentu saja aku juga pernah muda seperti kamu dan aku juga berani kalau perlu kurang ajar aku pisahkan antara urusan keluarga dan kepentingan pribadi dengan perjuangan penegakan keadilan tidak seperti para pengacara sekarang yang kebanyakan berdagang bahkan tidak seperti para elit dan cendekiawan yang cemerlang ketika masih di luar kekuasaan namun menjadi lebih buas dan keji ketika memperoleh kesempatan untuk menginjak injak keadilan dan kebenaran yang dulu diberhalakannya kamu pasti tidak terlalu jauh dari keadaanku waktu masih muda kamu sudah membaca riwayat hidupku yang belum lama ini ditulis di sebuah kampus di luar negeri bukan mereka menyebutku singa lapar aku memang tidak pernah berhenti memburu pencuri pencuri keadilan yang bersarang di lembaga lembaga tinggi dan gedung gedung bertingkat merekalah yang sudah membuat kejahatan menjadi budaya di negeri ini kamu bisa banyak belajar dari buku itu
1519556 aku tidak datang untuk menentang atau memuji anda anda dengan seluruh sejarah anda memang terlalu besar untuk dibicarakan meskipun bukan bebas dari kritik aku punya sederetan koreksi terhadap kebijakan kebijakan yang sudah anda lakukan dan aku terlalu kecil untuk menentang bahkan juga terlalu tak pantas untuk memujimu anda sudah tidak memerlukan cercaan atau pujian lagi karena kau bukan hanya penegak keadilan yang bersih kau yang selalu berhasil dan sempurna tetapi kau juga adalah keadilan itu sendiri
1519557 aku suka kau menyebut dirimu aku dan memanggilku kau berarti kita bisa bicara sungguh sungguh sebagai profesional pemburu keadilan
1519558 itu semua juga tidak lepas dari hasil gemblenganmu yang tidak kenal ampun
1519559 tidak apa jangan surut katakan saja apa yang hendak kamu katakan
1519560 jangan membatasi dirimu sendiri jangan membunuh diri dengan diskripsi diskripsi yang akan menjebak kamu ke dalam doktrin doktrin beku mengalir sajalah sewajarnya bagaikan mata air bagai suara alam karena kamu sangat diperlukan oleh bangsamu ini
1519561 terima kasih begini belum lama ini negara menugaskan aku untuk membela seorang penjahat besar yang sepantasnya mendapat hukuman mati pihak keluarga pun datang dengan gembira ke rumahku untuk mengungkapkan kebahagiannya bahwa pada akhirnya negara cukup adil karena memberikan seorang pembela kelas satu untuk mereka tetapi aku tolak mentah mentah kenapa karena aku yakin negara tidak benar benar menugaskan aku untuk membelanya negara hanya ingin mempertunjukkan sebuah teater spektakuler bahwa di negeri yang sangat tercela hukumnya ini sudah ada kebangkitan baru penjahat yang paling kejam sudah diberikan seorang pembela yang perkasa seperti mike tyson itu bukan istilahku aku pinjam dari apa yang diobral para pengamat keadilan di koran untuk semua sepak terjangku sebab aku selalu berhasil memenangkan semua perkara yang aku tangani aku ingin berkata tidak kepada negara karena pencarian keadilan tak boleh menjadi sebuah teater tetapi mutlak hanya pencarian keadilan yang kalau perlu dingin danbeku tapi negara terus juga mendesak dengan berbagai cara supaya tugas itu aku terima di situ aku mulai berpikir tak mungkin semua itu tanpa alasan lalu aku melakukan investigasi yang mendalam dan kutemukan faktanya walhasil kesimpulanku negara sudah memainkan sandiwara negara ingin menunjukkan kepada rakyat dan dunia bahwa kejahatan dibela oleh siapa pun tetap kejahatan bila negara tetap dapat menjebloskan bangsat itu sampai ke titik terakhirnya hukuman tembak mati walaupun sudah dibela oleh tim pembela seperti aku maka negara akan mendapatkan kemenangan ganda karena kemenangan itu pastilah kemenangan yang telak dan bersih karena aku yang menjadi jaminannya negara hendak menjadikan aku sebagai pecundang dan itulah yang aku tentang negara harusnya percaya bahwa menegakkan keadilan tidak bisa lain harus dengan keadilan yang bersih sebagaimana yang sudah anda lakukan selama ini
1519562 tapi aku datang kemari bukan untuk minta pertimbanganmu apakah keputusanku untuk menolak itu tepat atau tidak aku datang kemari karena setelah negara menerima baik penolakanku bajingan itu sendiri datang ke tempat kediamanku dan meminta dengan hormat supaya aku bersedia untuk membelanya
1519563 ya aku menerimanya sebab aku seorang profesional sebagai seorang pengacara aku tidak bisa menolak siapa pun orangnya yang meminta agar aku melaksanakan kewajibanku sebagai pembela sebagai pembela aku mengabdi kepada mereka yang membutuhkan keahlianku untuk membantu pengadilan menjalankan proses peradilan sehingga tercapai keputusan yang seadil adilnya
1519564 jangan dulu mempersoalkan kebenaran tapi kau telah menunjukkan dirimu sebagai profesional kau tolak tawaran negara sebab di balik tawaran itu tidak hanya ada usaha pengejaran pada kebenaran dan penegakan keadilan sebagaimana yang kau kejar dalam profesimu sebagai ahli hukum tetapi di situ sudah ada tujuan tujuan politik namun tawaran yang sama dari seorang penjahat malah kau terima baik tak peduli orang itu orang yang pantas ditembak mati karena sebagai profesional kau tak bisa menolak mereka yang minta tolong agar kamu membelanya dari praktik praktik pengadilan yang kotor untuk menemukan keadilan yang paling tepat asal semua itu dilakukannya tanpa ancaman dan tanpa sogokan uang kau tidak membelanya karena ketakutan bukan
1519565 tidak ada kemenangan di dalam pemburuan keadilan yang ada hanya usaha untuk mendekati apa yang lebih benar sebab kebenaran sejati kebenaran yang paling benar mungkin hanya mimpi kita yang tak akan pernah tercapai kalah menang bukan masalah lagi upaya untuk mengejar itu yang paling penting demi memuliakan proses itulah aku menerimanya sebagai klienku
1519566 seperti yang kamu katakan tadi salah atau benar juga tidak menjadi persoalan hanya ada kemungkinan kalau kamu membelanya kamu akan berhasil keluar sebagai pemenang
1519567 jangan meremehkan jaksa jaksa yang diangkat oleh negara aku dengar sebuah tim yang sangat tangguh akan diturunkan
1519568 perkaranya saja belum mulai bagaimana bisa tahu aku akan menang
1519569 sudah bertahun tahun aku hidup sebagai pengacara keputusan sudah bisa dibaca walaupun sidang belum mulai bukan karena materi perkara itu tetapi karena soal soal sampingan kamu terlalu besar untuk kalah saat ini
1519570 tapi kamu menerima membela penjahat itu bukan karena takut bukan
1519571 jumlah uang yang terlalu besar pada akhirnya juga adalah sebuah ancaman dia tidak memberikan angka angka
1519572 negara akan mendapat pelajaran penting jangan main main dengan kejahatan
1519573 tak usah kamu ulangi lagi bahwa kamu melakukan itu bukan karena takut bukan karena kamu disogok
1519574 betul ia minta tolong tanpa ancaman dan tanpa sogokan aku tidak takut
1519575 dan kamu menerima tanpa harapan akan mendapatkan balas jasa atau perlindungan balik kelak kalau kamu perlukan juga bukan karena kamu ingin memburu publikasi dan bintang bintang penghargaan dari organisasi kemanusiaan di mancanegara yang benci negaramu bukan
1519576 kalau begitu pulanglah anak muda tak perlu kamu bimbang keputusanmu sudah tepat menegakkan hukum selalu dirongrong oleh berbagai tuduhan seakan akan kamu sudah memiliki pamrih di luar dari pengejaran keadilan dan kebenaran tetapi semua rongrongan itu hanya akan menambah pujian untukmu kelak kalau kamu mampu terus mendengarkan suara hati nuranimu sebagai penegak hukum yang profesional
1519577 aku kira tak ada yang perlu dibahas lagi sudah jelas lebih baik kamu pulang sekarang biarkan aku bertemu dengan putraku sebab aku sudah sangat rindu kepada dia
1519578 maaf saya kira pertemuan harus diakhiri di sini pak beliau perlu banyak beristirahat selamat malam
1519579 katakan kepada ayahanda bahwa bukti bukti yang sempat dikumpulkan oleh negara terlalu sedikit dan lemah peradilan ini terlalu tergesa gesa aku akan memenangkan perkara ini dan itu berarti akan membebaskan bajingan yang ditakuti dan dikutuk oleh seluruh rakyat di negeri ini untuk terbang lepas kembali seperti burung di udara dan semoga itu akan membuat negeri kita ini menjadi lebih dewasa secepatnya kalau tidak kita akan menjadi bangsa yang lalai

1519854 completely free and up to our imaginations i like both ways its nice to have someone who can arrange songs in their own way and have someone replicate them the recording of the songs is more of a collective thing
1519855 im used to recording with a bass player and myself
1519856 but when we record its just me on the drums with these headphones that keep falling off and kevin playing a cheap casio i can barely hear it and im trying to remember the song it sounds like a cheap recording and i was so surprised with the final product everyone was able to play along and layer it in

1519916 i was struck by how theologically thin this book felt at times
1519917 for example in each of the four spheres scharen offered discrete practices table fellowship testimony communal discernment making music all of which may be pastorally appropriate and yet i wondered several things how do these particular practices find their grounding in and flow from rich theological traditions how do they reinforce a particular view of the world what stories make sense of these practices over others why these practices as with a great deal of the literature over the past ten years that emphasize practices or rituals ranging from dorothy bass to catherine bell there is almost a misbegotten faith that if we can simply inculcate practices that we will form people in appropriately spiritual ways my contention is that practices divorced from a grounding in a thick theological tradition a vision of who god is and who humans are of sin and redemption of things past and things to come will not sustain people in the faith for the long haul rather all they can produce is religious nominalism which is a far cry from religious or pastoral excellence

1519971 if we think of the three levels of human linguistic communicative activity in its broadest sense one of bodily habitus and mimicry one of symbolic expression in art poetry music dance and one of prose descriptive language we can say that aboriginal religious life was mainly couched in the first two but that the culture which emerges from modern western reform has largely abandoned these and confines itself to the third
