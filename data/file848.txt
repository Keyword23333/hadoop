8480001 whats the difference between a harley davidson and a hoover vacuum cleaner
8480002 the tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected
8480003 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
8480004 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
8480005 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby
8480006 hi my favourite place to sew is in my lounge room in our sorta newish massage chair its so cosy in front of the window near the fire place i love it the best thing is i can leave as bigger mess i want and it doesnt effect anyone lol and no one copmplains
8480007 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain

8480009 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8480010 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8480011 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8480012 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8480013 we have wanted to see alaska for the longest time we knew we did not want casinos buffets and las vegas shows we knew we wanted small and personal for our once in a life time trip we explored all the options linda of sunstone tours amp cruises was very knowledgeable as she has been on all the ships the idea of a new ship and 36 passengers appealed to us as we learned it wasnt a new ship but a completely renovated to perfection ship we flew to juneau and stayed at the alaska inn b amp b up on the hill at the edge of town after eating their breakfasts every morning it was good we had to walk back up the hill we explored all that juneau had to offer in a very busy four day visit linda sent us more than enough information to set us in the right direction
8480014 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8480015 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion
8480016 i move senator obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8480017 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8480018 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8480019 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8480020 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8480021 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8480022 beginning on 14 january 1994 almost a hundred people were individually picked up by commandos wearing uniforms and travelling in police vehicles
8480023 the writings of a non commissioned officer who wrote additional information for jitem files to be given to the jandarma headquarters command
8480024 i remember that gig and i remember those days vividly
8480025 last minute on earth what would you do who would you call your mobile is down who will write the history of that final day
8480026 the u s audience is always very receptive and enjoys quite a bit more of our jamming side
8480027 but it is also important for us to work our way to a bigger audience so we try hard each time hoping that something bigger will come out of it youll never know when or even if well ever come back
8480028 rock n roll is as visual as it is sonic
8480029 talk about being for it before you were against it
8480030 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8480031 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8480032 you always want to see the big league team do well
8480033 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8480034 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8480035 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8480036 i think the race will come down to the end
8480037 after we leave here were going to march to show the democratic party that they dont have a strict enough line on ending the war
8480038 what theyre talking about doing is going to take years and people are dying
8480039 four years ago we went to chicago to protest a war that we were lied into
8480040 today in denver were here to protest a war that we were lied into
8480041 what better place than here what better time than now
8480042 if you dont have time to do it right when will you have time to do it over
8480043 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8480044 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8480045 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8480046 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8480047 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8480048 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8480049 the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
8480050 make your ego porous will is of little importance complaining is nothing fame is nothing openness patience receptivity solitude is everything
8480051 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
8480052 never spend time with people who do not respect you
8480053 as you reach out for help expect to get it and many random acts of kindness great expectations can help
8480054 el destino te lo pone enfrente es tu decision si tomas la decision correcta y llegas alli
8480055 they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8480056 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8480057 the one who commits makes new and the one who suffers is the old
8480058 while the ancient church has captivated the evangelical imagination for some time it hasnt been until recently that its become an accepted fixture of the evangelical landscape and this is for the good
8480059 dallas willard richard foster and living and practicing monks and nuns
8480060 they are receiving good guidance on this road from wise teachers
8480061 without a new theological reformation the christian church as the authentic body of christ may not survive
8480062 where the sixteenth century reformation returned our focus to sacred scriptures as the only infallible rule for faith and practice the new reformation will return our focus to the sacred right of every person to self esteem the fact is the church will never succeed until it satisfies the human beings hunger for self value
8480063 reformation theology failed to make clear that the core of sin is a lack of self esteem
8480064 everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness and sin is lawlessness
8480065 when you find the man of peace you start working with that person and if they respond to you you work with them if they dont you dust the dust off your shoes you go to the next village
8480066 all pleasing and doctrinally sound schemes of christian education church growth and spiritual renewal came around at last to this disappointing result but whose fault was this failure
8480067 the gospel preached and the instruction and example given these faithful ones simply do not do justice to the nature of human personality as embodied incarnate
8480068 or the possibility the phrase was imprecise does it indicate a precise course of action he paul understood in definite terms carefully followed himself and called others to share of course it was the latter so obviously so for him and the readers of his own day that he would feel no need to write a book on the disciplines of the spiritual life that explained systematically what he had in mind
8480069 it is the amazing extent of our ability to utilize power outside ourselves that we must consider when we ask what the human being is the limits of our power to transcend ourselves utilizing powers not located in us including of course the spiritual are yet to be fully known
8480070 practicing a range of activities that have proven track records across the centuries will keep us from erring
8480071 this factual priority of solitude is i believe a sound element in monastic asceticism locked into interaction with the human beings that make up our fallen world it is all but impossible to grow in grace as one should
8480072 solitude is a terrible trial for it serves to crack open and bust apart the shell of our superficial securities it opens out to us the unknown abyss that we all carry within us and discloses the fact that these abysses are haunted
8480073 newborn babes who long for the pure milk of the word
8480074 his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence
8480075 but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to myriads of angels to the general assembly and church of the first born who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood which speaks better than the blood of abel
8480076 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
8480077 i was only 8 when my pal was trying to blow up the capital
8480078 the bill does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses
8480079 theres going to be a gap and were going to have more money going out than we have coming in unless we make some adjustments now
8480080 the correct protocol for retiring our flag after it has touched the ground shoud be burnt preferably and if not buird with honor
8480081 i got 99 problems but a bitch aint one of them
8480082 guilty as sin and free as a bird america is a great country
8480083 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8480084 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8480085 i didnt know i love you came with a knife in the back
8480086 weve got to face that as well and to come back after nights loss its huge for us
8480087 the rascals that have been hanging around us for a whole year we have to face that every time we lose a game like tuesday night were reminded of that so weve got to face it confront it deal with it and move on
8480088 thats how its going to be for the rest of the year a battle every day every series is going to be huge every game is going to be huge
8480089 its definitely a different frame of mind this year were not thinking about september 07 were thinking about winning right now
8480090 if you dont know where you are going any road will take you there
8480091 the tragedy of life doesnt lie in not reaching your goal the tragedy lies in having no goals to reach
8480092 i believe in this team and i believe in the guys on the field and i believe we can get this done
8480093 we couldnt have been any worse the first two games
8480094 its tough for everyone ive had some struggles my last few outings i just cant seem to get that clean outing
8480095 theres going to be a lot going on this offseason i promise you that
8480096 each day that ticks off games have more importance thats the bottom line when youre chasing people
8480097 what happens if sean goes down with a serious injury
8480098 coach ocain talked about that in the meeting and we said no later than game four or five because after that youd just be playing half a season basically
8480099 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge he said
8480100 we had quite a reasonable lead from the us overnight
8480101 there is a bit of life left in the old dog yet
8480102 the banks have had a bit of relief rally mr bishop said
8480103 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8480104 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8480105 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8480106 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8480107 silliest moves it would now oppose the whole bill in the senate
8480108 family to lineal descendants children and grandchildren for certain tax purposes
8480109 de facto inheritance tax at the top marginal rate that would create complicated hurdles for small business and farming families and provide money for lawyers and advisers
8480110 the light of day needs to be shone onto the activities of the sect
8480111 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8480112 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog
8480113 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8480114 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line
8480115 duff mckagan sold more than 90 million albums between 1987 and 1993
8480116 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
8480117 if you have a green party i want to join
8480118 seit sieben oder acht jahren geht das jetzt schon so
8480119 sie verlangten von mir dass ich eine strafe zahle weil ich angeblich eine stunde nicht in meinem wagen gesessen bin aber das war nur ein fadenscheiniger vorwand um geld von mir zu bekommen ich verweigerte die zahlung seitdem kann ich mein funksystem nicht mehr nutzen
8480120 da nutzt jemand seine machtposition aus ein kollege hat einen kunden an einen anderen taxler weitervermittelt weil dessen rollstuhl nachweislich nicht in das taxi passte es dauerte nicht lange bis jemand bei ihm auftauchte der ihm wegen fahrgastverweigerung eine so genannte strafe aufbrummen wollte
8480121 unter 600 metern seeh he gibt es die krankheit kaum ber 1200 metern seeh he ist fast kein baum nicht befallen
8480122 birnenb ume die h ufig betroffen sind sind zum teil 80 bis 100 jahre alt nur wenn man die krankheit rechtzeitig erkennt k nnen diese erhalten bleiben
8480123 we got knocked down got off the deck threw a wild left hook and landed and it put us back in first place
8480124 but the way we lost you never know where thats going to lead you we have been resilient when it comes to those types of things
8480125 that wasnt the way we scripted it but it worked out that way
8480126 the demons of the past the rascals that have been hanging around here for a whole year getting on us
8480127 every time we lose a game like tuesday night its a reminder of that so we have to come back the next night and we have to face it and confront it and deal with it and move on
8480128 the government now wants to subject us to full body x rays just to board a plane
8480129 the only way you have to prevent that is by voting for the libertarian party
8480130 we have got to get into those debates to go toe to toe and eye to eye with sen obama and sen mccain
8480131 we understand the constitution we believe in the constitution and we know that if we dont get a handle on it very very quickly it will be too late unless we start electing libertarians to the house of representatives and the senate
8480132 an expanded strategic and operational role for it planning that plays more in the hands of business than it does in the increasingly commoditized hands of it implementation and operations
8480133 theyve been to the top and they have shown me the way you should carry yourself i think it has helped all of us kids to be a lot more mature
8480134 we can be sitting outside cooking something on the barbecue and all of a sudden 20 kids have shown up
8480135 its like oh well then its off to the store for more food
8480136 we are more interested in developing a great man than a great athlete
8480137 we told him we didnt just want to play sports for fun we wanted to be the best we can be
8480138 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and wife lucy is doing great
8480139 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access
8480140 we chose radwins systems over the competition because the price is unbeatable and the systems are extremely reliable and robust we have deployed winlink 1000 and they operate flawlessly even in the harsh climate and the tough geography in the region in one scenario we installed nine radwin links in a daisy chain formation enabling us to achieve a range of over 330 km 205 mi with some links transmitting over 50 km thanks to radwins high capacity long range links we can reach out to serve underserved communities in rural areas
8480141 we are pleased to present industriya svyazi with this advanced offering together with our partner newtech with this latest win radwin is further increasing its strong foothold in the cis countries where the demand for data connectivity is growing at an exponential rate with our solutions operators can leverage the huge demand for broadband and also bring connectivity to remote and hard to reach areas in the fastest most affordable way
8480142 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access
8480143 its made a big difference teachers can use online resources in the lessons without having to cart the kids down to an it suite
8480144 blackfen school became a maths and computing college in september 2004 and straight away the senior leadership team and i realised that we needed to give our students and teachers more access to ict as a tool outside of ict and business studies lessons
8480145 we started with two or three access points that roamed around with the lapsafes
8480146 with one 802 11b access point shared by twenty students it took ten to fifteen minutes for pupils to log in in a one hour lesson that is not acceptable
8480147 it was quite interesting trying to organise which access point was on which channel but once it went 3d and we had three story buildings channel planning was quite a puzzle
8480148 i found a nice case study written by a us university that found you can just get away with five
8480149 half the wireless lan decided to switch off encryption during one holiday
8480150 it looked like a case of trying to find the budget and justifying it
8480151 it turned everything we previously thought we knew about wi fi on its head
8480152 we set it up in the difficult building the one with wire mesh in the walls
8480153 we plugged all four aps in but we found we could get away with two for the entire floor
8480154 there was no cut off even when we ran around streaming dvds from a server
8480155 the laptops have never been used so much they are a real viable alternative to carting the kids down to an it suite staff know that five minutes after giving the laptops out the pupils are logged in and ready to go
8480156 there are no conflicts for the laptops if they are in range of more than one access point this has led to a much more efficient wireless network and we have further expanded our lapsafe provision around school
8480157 students now have much more access to ict in many of their lessons
8480158 students are able to access their work online during lessons
8480159 for example in as french students regularly access work in the mle that supports their comprehension and oral work by giving them video and audio files in genuine french to work from
8480160 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access
8480161 the japanese governments commitment to afghan reconstruction and the war on terror will never change
8480162 the worlds superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry
8480163 to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a
8480164 to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living
8480165 to contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance
8480166 i agree with deporting the illegals i agree with that 100
8480167 anarchy is going to come how many of us can commit a crime and get away with it
8480168 its happening all over the united states so why would you think theyre going to leave austin
8480169 theres no doubt that its a threat to national identity
8480170 has a net positive economic impact on these towns and probably socially as well
8480171 its obvious that we need these workers and the majority of them are hardworking people with families
8480172 we need to keep talking about it its just knocking down those barriers
8480173 were having to build a new jail for a reason
8480174 you take all their freebies away from them and go after the people that hired them and theyre going to go back home on their own
8480175 businesses are going to move to town because weve solved the immigration problem
8480176 not because were battling them and throwing them out of town
8480177 i never thought id live this long to see this
8480178 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8480179 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8480180 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
8480181 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
8480182 im proud of my country im 63 i was refused buying a candy bar when i was 7 years old i have been refused trying to purchase a home in an all white neighborhood this is nothing short of a miracle
8480183 i can hardly describe how i feel i am so excited
8480184 when i think about civil rights activist medgar evers who lost his life registering people to vote we have come a long way in this country and we need a man like barack obama to lead us into the future
8480185 one of the greatest things that ever happened in my 86 years
8480186 i know medgar martin luther king and others never dreamed they would see this day forty five years ago we couldnt do this medgar was killed 45 years ago trying to get the right to be heard period
8480187 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8480188 the sportsmanship of hillary clinton really made women even greater
8480189 when barack became her candidate he became mine it was difficult because it was a bitter battle between two qualified very talented candidates for presidency
8480190 its going to take me awhile because ive been supporting her so long
8480191 but i intend to vote for obama i intend to put an obama sign in my yard and a bumper sticker on my car and to work for him so we can win this election
8480192 he wasnt my no 1 candidate but hes my no 1 candidate now because hes going to make a difference in my life
8480193 its who we represent who elected us we represent the 18 million voters out there our vote is their voice all of us are pretty passionate about that and feel that its not over until then
8480194 after that then we get to step back and then move forward and help elect a democrat into the white house
8480195 we just have to move on and i understand that and i am supporting obama
8480196 the sense of urgency was made very very clear the party is unified
8480197 i think it will change america in more ways than anyone realizes yet
8480198 once we get past that threshold of the first black president it will throw off many chains that bind us and make us the great country we were meant to be
8480199 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8480200 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8480201 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8480202 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8480203 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8480204 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8480205 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that michelle obama watching from her seat in the balcony stood and applauded as the former president praised her man and obama delighting the crowd with his appearance on stage praised both clintons as well as his wife for their prime time speeches this week hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8480206 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8480207 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8480208 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8480209 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8480210 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8480211 is this the entrance to the den how can you tell
8480212 i just know colette and i talk a lot is all
8480213 asphodel you have to leave please just go these are monsters
8480214 you think a gaggle of vampire children can defeat us
8480215 it seems we are too late the vampires have changed their precious elite
8480216 protective are we well since we cannot have your elite ill keep her lovely mother instead
8480217 what use to me are you now id just have to kill you
8480218 you are a pretty little thing even for a vampire
8480219 he lifted a large hand and ran his forefinger along my cheekbone and then around my jaw
8480220 what did you think would happen when you got here child did you think that you would storm in and scare us all did you think you would get here and i would release your parents without a fight how na ve you are
8480221 no na ve is not the right sentiment perhaps stupid is better
8480222 so lorc n you sniveling coward not to be clich but we can do this the easy way and you can hand them over no more harmed than they are now or we can settle this the good old fashioned gory way
8480223 as much as i would love to let these charming humans go im afraid i cant
8480224 i could snap his neck like nothing you wouldnt want me to do that now would you let me have the girl and ill let them free no harm done
8480225 im afraid i cant allow either of those things to happen you see if you keep her parents i lose asphodel and well i cant have that and if you keep her i lose her and zeke i definitely cant have that
8480226 es el primer volumen de una serie que abarcar la historia de puerto rico en la segunda mitad del siglo veinte una historia vista no a trav s de analistas pol ticos ni de investigadores sino desde la perspectiva de la gente com n que ha vivido esa historia este primer volumen muestra eventos que han quedado en el olvido o que incluso nunca se hab an documentado
8480227 sab a usted que en 1950 puerto rico vivi la experiencia que hoy se vive en irak sab a que r o piedras dej de ser municipio por error de sus residentes en un refer ndum probablemente tampoco sabe que durante ocho a os el partido independentista tuvo una fuerza electoral que puso a temblar al gobierno y que la independencia ten a muchos m s simpatizantes que la estadidad en ese caso querr saber c mo se invirtieron los papeles
8480228 achieving the goal is really not that difficult its the pursuit that really makes it worth while
8480229 i have no regrets my choices made me who i am today
8480230 well if this had happened then id have never met done
8480231 oh i need to go to walmart and get toliet paper and while im in the same parking lot lets go in and buy new dress pants that i couldnt get in my size
8480232 sorry you have to work on sunday or lose your job
8480233 im certainly supporting sen mccain will do whatever i can to help him get elected but im focused on being governor of louisiana

8480235 it strikes me that its going to be very hard for obamas campaign to explain that jindal as a governor who has served as an assistant secretary of health and human services has served as a congressional staffer has served as a congressman is not qualified but sen obama is qualified
8480236 obama is a very articulate very intelligent harvard law graduate who is extraordinarily smart and hes not going to come across in a debate like some guy whos dopey
8480237 hes going to come across as fully prepared he knows how to study all this stuff he has the military advisers
8480238 the problem with obama is hes wrong its not that hes inexperienced its that his policies are wrong

8480287 by specifically supporting all of the major carriers in canada this new version of interreach fusion will further accelerate our success in the north american market
8480288 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access
8480289 we wanted our staff to have cellular connectivity throughout the complex and we decided to purchase a system ourselves to speed deployment and provide multi carrier coverage
8480290 adcs interreach unison system was clearly the best of the systems we evaluated because it offered high performance with high cost efficiency and it could support multiple carriers without requiring additional cabling
8480291 our interreach unison product was created specifically to address the wireless coverage challenges of buildings larger than 250 000 square feet delivering strong and consistent performance in dense traffic environments

8480298 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8480299 my assumption would be that if we could actually stabilize iraq in such a way that you do not have warfare between the sunnis the shiias and the kurds some semblance of law and order in that country then i think that there is no doubt that the kerry administration is going to be interested in bringing back the reservists and the national guardsmen who are currently there but
8480300 i think it is also true that the bush administration would bring the troops back
8480301 were going to stay in iraq forever no matter what
8480302 whether john kerry is in the white house or george bush is in the white house that is not going to cause the french or the germans or the russians or others who do not see it in their national interest to be engaged in iraq right now to suddenly say well john i like you a lot better than i liked george
8480303 well ted you have been there and i have not
8480304 i do not know whether or not we can accomplish that in six months if we can then i think john kerry will bring our troops home
8480305 we got a driver who drove the bus into the ditch now we can argue about how that happened but weve got to get the bus out of the ditch that does not mean you dont fire the driver
8480306 and i think that there is a strong feeling that even among those that supported bushs decision initially to go in that there was some fudging of the numbers and shading the truth
8480307 all of us assume that when we make that commitment that we have to finish the job we owe it not only to the troops who sacrificed their lives but also the iraqi people
8480308 presidents often talk about the importance of their personal relations with other leaders but essentially that is a lot of hooey you know nations do things because of national interest
8480309 errr uuummmmm i am not the me ahhhh i thought i knew
8480310 presidents often talk about the importance of their personal relations with other leaders but essentially that is a lot of hooey you know nations do things because of national interest
8480311 all of us assume that when we make that commitment that
8480312 the failure of the iraqi state would be a disaster
8480313 it would dishonor the 900 plus men and women who have already died it would be a betrayal of the promise that we made to the iraqi people and it would be hugely destabilizing from a national security perspective

8480452 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8480453 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8480454 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8480455 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8480480 the status quo was all the tie being altered by israel in her favor
8480481 i imagine that a number of those evicted settled somewhere in the golan heights and that their children have watched the land that had been in their families for hundreds of years being cultivated by israeli farmers from time to time they opened fire on these farmers that of course was a violation of the armistice agreement though i could not help thinking that in similar circumstances norwegian peasants would almost certainly have acted in the same way
8480482 all japanese people are nice but all canadians are mean
8480483 what is the need for such a picture vijender did us all proud at the olympics but glamorising smoking this way can only prove harmful to all those who admire him and his achievement
8480484 its quite possible that he didnt understand the implications of what he was doing at the time but it is now his responsibility to dissociate himself from this immediately
8480485 theres no doubt about this some schoolchildren dont even think that smoking is a harmful habit because they see their icons doing the same
8480486 vijender has just returned after his achievement and were already descending upon him in this mean manner why is it that when you become a national icon you lose your right to live the way you want to
8480487 he must not have realised the implications of such a photo nonetheless he should have known better i am sure he wont do it again
8480488 cancer is not a contagious disease like chicken pox in fact it is the cancer patient who has to take precaution and should not sit next to a person suffering from cold cough or chicken pox as that may endanger his life many times cancer patients ask if they can play or sit next to a normal person and we tell them clearly that they can live a normal life
8480489 loud music is disturbing and distracting the police must ban that however i cannot drive without playing music it relaxes me and keeps me awake the cops should instead nab those who watch tv while driving
8480490 as long as i dont play music at a high volume it does not harm anyone the police must ban only those who play loud music
8480491 the dna sample of the accused was never asked for as it is an open and shut case for the prosecution we are quite confident that the evidence scientific circumstantial gathered in the case against both the accused would be enough to establish their role in the killing and subsequent act of disposing the evidence in the court
8480492 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day in the first round didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8480493 i still look at it as this is where i should be if im healthy and can play halfway decent
8480494 im obviously probably more excited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches
8480495 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practising for singles
8480496 so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8480497 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8480498 business dealings of biden family could be problematic for him
8480499 i just wanted to come here for a little something to say
8480500 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8480501 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea that change doesnt start from the top down its starts from the bottom up
8480502 i think you know the answer your people also enslaved african americans you killed my son so its fair in a cosmic sense you cant comprehend
8480503 were all just cereal mascots stop reading the fucking horoscopes
8480504 i then said to him i dont care about god bless america i just need to use the bathroom as soon as i said that he immediately pinned my arm behind my back
8480505 he shoved me out the front gate and told me get out of their country if i didnt like it
8480506 because they are enforcing a rule of that imposes political correctness through refusing to let somebody go to bathroom while a patriotic song is playing that violates constitutional rights
8480507 the officers observed a male standing on his seat cursing using inappropriate language and acting in a disorderly manner while reeking of alcohol and decided to eject him rather than subject others to his offensive behavior
8480508 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8480509 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8480510 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8480511 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8480512 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8480513 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8480514 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8480515 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8480516 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8480517 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8480518 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8480519 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8480520 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8480521 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8480522 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8480523 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8480524 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8480525 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8480526 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8480527 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8480528 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8480529 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8480530 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8480531 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8480532 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8480533 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8480534 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
8480535 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
8480536 even though the government has been tolerant of anti government positions and criticisms on the internet we are very concerned about statements that insult religion and reek of racism
8480537 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8480538 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8480539 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play

8480541 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8480542 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8480543 si ha habido alguna rajadura ha sido o muy coincidente o anterior pero de este sismo no creo
8480544 el monitoreo nunca termina porque siempre estamos a la expectativa no podemos evitar que se produzcan estos fen menos adversos pero por lo menos estamos preparados para actuar con serenidad
8480545 esta no es una zona de sismos aunque no es tan malo que la energ a vaya liber ndose gradualmente
8480546 you know what i hear about obama if he gets into the white house hes going to tear up the rose garden and put in watermelons
8480547 ive got a big old tear in the front seat of my pickup think you can come out and fix it for me with that
8480548 its got a boom on the end of it and theres that semi next to it and the train wagon behind im a foreman and me and my team we go along the track fixing it clean out the mud from under the track and fill it with stones that wagon out there is full of stones
8480549 over there in wyoming how big a hole do you think that produced huh
8480550 oh oh wait they used to feed me this really great thing made of potatos and other stuff fried and spicy whats it called
8480551 you know all over the world theres a certain look that just says wealth dont you think thats what these guys had
8480552 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008
8480553 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8480554 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing
8480555 he is willing to abide by whatever conditions the court imposes
8480556 he does not want to live this lonely wretched life hes been living
8480557 first id like to apologize to the victim and to the general public i made the wrong choice im 100 percent ready to take full responsibility
8480558 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8480559 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8480560 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8480561 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8480562 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8480563 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8480564 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8480565 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8480566 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8480567 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8480568 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8480569 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8480570 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off

8480577 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew
8480578 mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel 7 miss his energy and smile
8480579 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8480580 depression affects people regardless of their age gender cultures and social economic group depression is an illness that can affect anyone
8480581 whether youre famous or not what it just means is that the rest of us will hear about it it doesnt mean that theyre the only people who will experience it theyre all equally tragic
8480582 but it can be harder for famous people to seek help because of their high profiles
8480583 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many
8480584 bless you for giving us such enjoyment in watching you blossom in front of our eyes its a shame you arent with us anymore

8480589 for 15 months mr gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8480590 allege that the illicit trafficking scheme from their recruitment in nepal to their eventual employment in iraq was engineering by kbr and its subcontractor
8480591 so it is premature for us to comment at this time
8480592 in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8480593 i dont know i havent been keeping track of what ricks saying
8480594 this is kind of like the presidential race the guy has to say i endorse this i dont know laughter make him document it whatever no i havent paid much attention there
8480595 sark offensive coordinator steve sarkisian and i kicked it over the other day uscs pete carroll said of
8480596 much confidence in our offense they didnt really need to go for the long range field goals
8480597 the whole internet infrastructure is based on the assumption of trust with security overlaid on top
8480598 this is an inherent problem that internet infrastructure is insecure
8480599 generally its carriers that use bgp and the issue is really about strictly managing the bgp set
8480600 ideally isps should only allow authenticated servers to propagate changes but that means everyone in the trust chain would have to participate the easiest mitigation is that isps monitor their address space and monitor who is peering with bgp through blacklists and whitelists

8480607 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8480608 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8480609 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8480610 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8480611 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8480612 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8480613 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8480614 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8480615 because i believe and my parents brought me up that way
8480616 they want an easy answer so that they can sleep at night and know this is not going to happen tomorrow at their school and there is no such thing in this case theres not an easy answer ive been working on this nonstop daily since april 20th and i cant tell you why it happened
8480617 its pretty clear now that the initial plan was to have the two propane bombs they put in the cafeteria go off
8480618 and thats as indiscriminate as you can get every kid killed was a target of opportunity
8480619 sticking a gun underneath a table and firing they didnt even know who was under that table
8480620 how many of the jocks hang out in the library at lunch time
8480621 every young boy or girl happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time including isaiah shoels
8480622 many of the kids were actually hiding under desks and hearing only bits and fragments of the conversation
8480623 it appears that exactly who they taunted what questions were asked and who replied what may never be crystal clear
8480624 probably about god probably was there a nigger comment probably but thats not what it was about
8480625 we can tell you why they did it because they tell us why theyre going to do it
8480626 they could have killed a lot more if they wanted to if they had gone in two different doors they could have literally had a murderous crossfire they could have killed hundreds of students and thats not counting the pipe bombs
8480627 i know the plan was to kill as many kids as they could
8480628 why didnt they kill more when the bombs failed i dont know lets just call ourselves lucky
8480629 either go in or wait as students came streaming out and then start shooting at them
8480630 then it looks like they decided well what the hell the bombs didnt go off lets just start shooting
8480631 we know after they killed them in the library they had kids that had locked themselves in classrooms all over the place
8480632 they could see harris and klebold walk by and they had glass on the doors there were still little pockets of two or three kids here or there hidden under tables in the cafeteria they could have easily walked around and in numerous ways killed more people so why didnt they maybe were just lucky that these were 17 and 18 year olds who were not as superior as they thought
8480633 the two trench coat mafia teens who were responsible for the columbine high school massacre last april
8480634 harris and klebold were never part of the trench coat mafia
8480635 suddenly there were thousands of trench coat mafia all over the country
8480636 i get internet threats from like iowa that theyre the trench coat mafia
8480637 because of the raw emotions the strong feelings that existed right after the tragedy
8480638 twelve of the 18 said thanks but no thanks and returned to school
8480639 six of the 12 accepted the offer there was only one student who we were not going to allow back to school
8480640 no student can recall ever seeing eric wear a trench coat other than once this past fall 1998 other than the day of the shooting
8480641 i can say firmly that the reason they wore coats was for logistical practical reasons
8480642 the idea was so they could walk up to the school without being seen walking across the parking lot carrying a gun
8480643 but im here to tell you i sat down and ive spent a lot of time with the klebolds and theyre nice people its not like theyre these monsters that raised a monster i mean they truly are clueless about any warning signs that this was going to happen
8480644 perhaps the parents were somewhat naive but i think there was a very deliberate attempt to mislead a lot of people their friends teachers when they got caught breaking into a car they were able to successfully get past a magistrate a probation officer and everyone else
8480645 so he quite often would act out somewhat inappropriately more to get a reaction than what he may have been thinking or feeling
8480646 taunt the jocks back by hugging and kissing on one of the other trench coat mafia guys
8480647 what i see is a guy kind of chasing around skirts like i guess many seniors do
8480648 he talks about being frustrated because he cant get laid
8480649 students heard what other students said on tv and started repeating that as if it were true
8480650 i know to the minute but im not going to tell you
8480651 put together with gunshots going off and just the most terrifying situation in their life what they remember now may not be anywhere near what really happened
8480652 i have to say that was not a very professional introduction before please dont tie me into family and my establishment
8480653 do you think they didnt stop because were not white
8480654 we have to run a new line out here itll take two or three hours you want us to do it tonight
8480655 we could turn it back on for you whatever you want to do
8480656 a federal judge ruled yesterday that the government owes native american plaintiffs 455 million for mismanaging and withholding mineral royalties grazing fees and other revenues overseen by the department of interior
8480657 in fact the name of the case has changed through the years with each new secretary of the interior
8480658 the legal saga has been nearly as astonishing as the story of government incompetence
8480659 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
8480660 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
8480661 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
8480662 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
8480663 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
8480664 mr wilsons central involvement in the cold war in south asia does not warrant the honor of establishing a university chair in his name
8480665 a named chair sends a public message that not only the holder of the chair but its donor represent standards to which the university and larger community should aspire
8480666 theres a range of sentiments from mild to outrage truly we had assumed this thing was not going to go anywhere
8480667 or if it did we would be consulted we learned about the charlie wilson chair not from the south asian institute or the dean but from the newspapers
8480668 no faculty members have requested a meeting with either of us to discuss their concerns
8480669 but at the nanoscale there is not enough space or time to create these dislocations
8480670 the recoil is too weak to beat the adhesion forces between the nanoparticle and the substrate
8480671 adhesion is a very important property especially if you are using the film in an aggressive environment like industrial machining
8480672 the thing about my family is theres five of us marge bart girl bart the one who doesnt talk and the fat one how i loathe him
8480673 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8480674 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8480675 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8480676 you always want to see the big league team do well
8480677 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8480678 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8480679 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8480680 i think the race will come down to the end
8480681 there are many ways that a legal couple status may support a relationship more family understanding acceptance by friends and coworkers greater commitment that results from a public declaration and enhanced legal protections in the form of health care benefits and community property
8480682 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8480683 the only one who leaves me both breathless and speechless at the same time
8480684 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8480685 tenho que dizer que n o foi nada profissional da sua parte a introdu o dessa entrevista por favor n o me prenda minha fam lia e aos neg cios do meu cunhado
8480686 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8480687 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion
8480688 i say to you it will be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city
8480689 the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart
8480690 all we can offer is a tease of sorts there are a lot of issues and the accc cant yet give out its views but we will have significant discussions over the coming year on the big topics
8480691 the issue for developing nbn cost models is how to set values of existing infrastructure which is considered legacy or a sunk cost
8480692 the problems arent all unique to telecommunications and are common in the utilities market but they have settled on them and moved on

8480722 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8480723 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8480724 how frail is humanity how short is life and how full of trouble like a flower we blossom for a moment and then wither like the shadow of a passing cloud we quickly disappear

8480780 i want as much time as i can get with the guys and now im limited with their two situations
8480781 were going to do everything we can to get ready whatever it takes
8480782 if we dont have a full game plan in because were not comfortable with some of the stuff that theyd normally run had they had a full offseason to work out and get ready then well go with a smaller game plan and figure out what works best for us
8480783 theyve been trying to get me out of here for a long time now im just waiting on the call looking at the clock i could be gone any minute now
8480784 im not disappointed im not bothered im not worried just move on thats part of the game part of the business so ill let it be ill be fine
8480785 it is rumor and it really makes no sense for me to confirm or deny anything at any point in time until something is done one way or another with a player
8480786 thats the time of the year it is everybody is a rumor right now
8480787 its out there so evidently its true im prepared im ready im fine with that its no big deal to me
8480788 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8480789 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8480790 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8480791 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8480792 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8480793 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8480794 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8480795 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8480796 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8480797 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8480798 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8480799 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8480800 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8480801 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8480802 will allow me the chance to gain their trust back
8480803 i spoke with him and thanked him in person for giving me this opportunity
8480804 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asked we do the best job we can to prepare him and get him ready to play thats what he asked me to do and thats what were going to do
8480805 im not really worried or focused on that because i dont plan on getting into any trouble im happy to be back and just ready to move forward work on my game and do whatever i can to help the team
8480806 this last three four months have been very humbling for chris
8480807 the week after the charges were dropped the phone didnt ring being on the street was very humbling
8480808 it would have been a terrible waste for his talent to be on the street
8480809 im glad hes getting another chance hopefully he can right the ship i know its going to be an uphill battle for him but hes my teammate and im going to support him

8480811 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8480812 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8480813 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8480814 the light of day needs to be shone onto the activities of the sect
8480815 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge he said
8480816 we had quite a reasonable lead from the us overnight
8480817 there is a bit of life left in the old dog yet
8480818 the banks have had a bit of relief rally mr bishop said
8480819 silliest moves it would now oppose the whole bill in the senate
8480820 family to lineal descendants children and grandchildren for certain tax purposes
8480821 de facto inheritance tax at the top marginal rate that would create complicated hurdles for small business and farming families and provide money for lawyers and advisers
8480822 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8480823 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog
8480824 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8480825 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line
8480826 duff mckagan sold more than 90 million albums between 1987 and 1993
8480827 this is another proof to how much cruel the arabs are in driving our sisters to sufferings and sucide
8480828 this kind of cruel treatment by these barabarians makes you pray to god to give israel the power to destroy these koshasha arabs
8480829 i feel sorry for my sister who are now facing a brutual tretment by these failthy arabs
8480830 if we go back in history since the 17 and 18th centuries arabs were enemy number one for african communities by raiding africans hunt and ship them as slaves
8480831 arabs can sometimes be the worst racists that one can imagine omo
8480832 something i really am sad about when such reports are revealed is how the eyes of the readers view them
8480833 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8480834 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8480835 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8480836 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for a number of acoustically communicating animals
8480837 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8480838 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8480839 as in humans if an anole can do a number of of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8480840 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
8480841 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
8480842 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
8480843 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
8480844 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
8480845 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
8480846 researchers have been so preoccupied with creating a barcode of life that they have not been careful in monitoring the accuracy of the underlying data
8480847 talk about an extreme makeover scientists have transformed one type of cell into another in living mice a big step toward the goal of growing replacement tissues to treat a variety of diseases the cell identity switch turned ordinary pancreas cells into the rarer type that churns out insulin essential for preventing diabetes but its implications go beyond diabetes to a host of possibilities scientists said its the second advance in about a year that suggests that someday doctors might be able to use a patients own cells to treat disease or injury without turning to stem cells taken from embryos
8480848 new taxes to support dirigo care the maine state governments attempt at providing universal healthcare have so angered maine residents that a coalition dedicated to repealing the tax increases was able to collect nearly twice as many signatures as required to put a repeal referendum on the states ballot this november

8480854 yall sit down weve got to get on with the show here
8480855 ladies and gentlemen i am honoured to be here tonight sit down please please sit
8480856 you know i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight i am here first to support barack obama
8480857 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you that supported her to vote for barack obama in november and heres why our country is in trouble
8480858 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world and heres what i have to say about that everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8480859 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas understanding and insights america will have the national security leadership we need
8480860 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8480861 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8480862 the choice is clear the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8480863 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8480864 lets send the republicans a simple message that will echoe from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8480865 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8480866 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8480867 australia picked up 31 medals with the assistance of sportstecs coaching tools including in basketball equestrian hockey softball swimming water polo and synchronised diving
8480868 this is a fantastic result and a gold medal performance in itself for this terrific nsw company
8480869 i did it on my show first with claudia charriez
8480870 but you know what theres not going to be a moment where tyras not going to knock me off so im not bothered by her
8480871 i never got a note or call from tyra thanking me for helping to put her show on the map
8480872 you can definitely play as us or you can play against us
8480873 to this day people ask me about the cockroach it was disgusting
8480874 i have a fear of bugs and i had to disinfect my mouth with 100 proof vodka and just spit the bug out
8480875 but theres so much of it im not worried its going to go away
8480876 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8480877 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8480878 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8480879 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8480880 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8480881 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8480882 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8480883 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8480884 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8480885 obama est mon candidat il doit tre notre pr sident
8480886 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8480887 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8480888 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8480889 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8480890 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8480891 i want you to know this has been a joy boy did we have a good time trying
8480892 i cant push it off anymore i need to talk tonight or tommorw night

8480898 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
8480899 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal

8480943 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8480944 it doesnt really pigeonhole you into one specific area but gives you a broader perspective and understanding of the world around us
8480945 it would be valuable to someone in business whos manufacturing in one country and shipping across the world for example or to someone working for a non governmental organization providing aid in different countries
8480946 anyone completing the program will have a unique set of business legal cultural and social skills to use in whatever work they end up doing
8480947 what were doing is taking advantage of the strengths of the university wherever they exist and bringing them together so a student can access them
8480948 this is the real benefit of a research university and part of the beauty of the university of utah that we are much more able to do this than most other places
8480949 were going to be pulling costumes from past productions instead of making new ones
8480950 we also have plans to bring costs up for ticket prices
8480951 it adds a few thousand dollars and we need every dollar we can get
8480952 for a theater department with such a long history at the u they get overlooked all the time for funding
8480953 it means hiring new tenure line professors you can have auxiliary or adjunct faculty who sign a contract from year to year but for a strong graduate program we need to select the right people to fill that tenure line
8480954 if you have 300 students in a class thats really good but if youre an advanced russian class with six students its not so good
8480955 to have a strong undergraduate and graduate program we need more national high quality faculty to help us strengthen the program further
8480956 the performing arts building theyre in is an old aging space that was built in the 1930s
8480957 the university said were on the list as the new tenant
8480958 we would share with the fine arts dean and film studies department
8480959 theater students in all areas need experience in a range of theaters not just black box theaters
8480960 weve managed to squeak by in the past but now we cant
8480961 were looking at the basic needs and well have to cut some corners
8480962 there are more options than single car single occupant this is mostly educational to help people see whats available
8480963 i hope this will become an emphasis for the whole year
8480964 were wearing these shirts to support the parking services incentive for mass transit
8480965 there are a lot of things that we are doing to provide better service to our consumers but that also falls under the go green label
8480966 we have to come up with something each year to help people know that we can help the environment
8480967 this is a part of our contribution as a member of the salt lake valley community
8480968 as a university we need to reduce our traffic air pollution and carbon footprint by getting people not to drive alone in cars
8480969 access to this site is denied by its own decision
8480970 power engineering is becoming more complex with so many more power sources such as wind and solar
8480971 when i was an undergraduate it was a required course it hasnt been a required curriculum for some time
8480972 many of the engineers were hired in the late 70s and early 80s and that workforce is beginning to retire
8480973 the whole industry experiences a shortage of power engineers in the market now we see fairly high attrition rates and anticipate a higher attrition rate over the next five years
8480974 as we see our industry change we looked for engineers
8480975 we decided to see if the u could help make some engineers for the workforce
8480976 this program is in part a response to student surveys and exit interviews
8480977 we were not getting the initial competencies from hired engineering students
8480978 this program will prepare them for that hefty project when they walk through the door
8480979 a professor and group of students get together and we pose an industry problem we fund this coming together of students its almost a consultancy
8480980 as far as hiring one year ago i was eight engineers in the hole
8480981 since we started working with the u now im where i need to be
8480982 they will handle hefty engineering problems in the first few months
8480983 the senior design project last year with rocky mountain power is the most industry input weve had so far
8480984 one thing i want to do with this class is to take a field trip to a rocky mountain power site to have industry professionals talk to the students directly
8480985 although the program hasnt grown enough industry folk will and can be very helpful
8480986 we have the money we have the classes we have the people to teach the classes
8480987 were just looking for a faculty member with a developed research program to build the program over time and make it sustainable
8480988 we still dont have a good handle on what causes cerebral palsy in preterm babies
8480989 and how magnesium fits in this whole equation we dont really know but we have used it long enough to know that its safe im sure that this will change some aspects of high risk obstetrics and change habits and practices in delivery rooms
8480990 the rate of cerebral palsy incidence certainly isnt going down
8480991 there are an average of two pre term children born each week with cerebral palsy in utah this is a significant problem
8480992 i had two treatments and my son was born the next day he never had any of the complications or surgeries that so many premature babies undergo i cant really say if it was the magnesium but im glad i opted for the treatment
8480993 i really do think our findings are going to change things
8480994 im very grateful to all of the women who took part in the study and to all the researchers and university of utah faculty that made it possible

8480997 there is no excuse for people to be too fat the conservatives will declare today as they launch a drive to encourage healthier lifestyles in a speech which points to conservative demands for greater personal responsibility across social policy the tories health spokesman andrew lansley will insist that people claiming biological or environmental causes for their obesity are simply making excuses
8480998 uk no excuse for being fat tory health spokesman declares

8481009 we built a reputation around doing high quality work and delivering it when we said we would
8481010 we needed to make a significant jump in the technological curve so we felt strongly about purchasing a new press
8481011 plus the extra help a new press manufacturer gives you has been great heidelberg has been really good about training troubleshooting and helping us grow into this the cd 74 was one of the smoothest installations we have ever had it just was an easy transition we had no hiccups
8481012 i think we are going to be one of the first in the state of alabama to go web to print and this press has given us the capability to do that
8481013 the industry reacted very well to the introduction of printvalue at drupa and now we are bringing it to north america at graph expo
8481014 in todays economic climate it requires more than just being a good printer with a good press the printvalue program offers an across the board service strategy that puts you ahead of the competition you can continue doing great work and now at the same time you can reduce costs and increase your efficiency by taking advantage of everything these programs have to offer
8481015 its not only performance but production reliability workflow and doing what it takes to be more profitable
8481016 we hear from printers all the time about giving them the tools to make them more productive

8481019 its great to know that ive been here since day one
8481020 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8481021 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8481022 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me

8481052 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8481053 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8481054 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8481055 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8481056 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply

8481079 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first

8481088 jdf integration is capable to rendering far more than only the streamlining of internal processes in the printing industry the aim is the efficient integration of the complete value added chain which reaches from the print buyer to the printer and then to delivery in this process jdf is the key technology
8481089 with the help of our jdf capable sprint software the open and standardized communication between our customers the print buyers and their suppliers in print production is feasable
8481090 this jdf connectivity to the sprint system of star publishing provides our customers a remarkable additional benefit because formerly completely separated process flows are now interlocked and completely automated improving speed reducing labor and providing significant value to the print buyer
8481091 were thrilled to be a part of this premier event no place is more important for gathering information on the newest techniques and technologies in the commercial package printing and converting industries than in chicago
8481092 visitors at our booth 5439 during the show will get to know some of our staff and receive complete information how estimator can eliminate estimating errors reduce estimating time by 70 or more and improve sales 10 15 by doing instant quotes while the client is on the phone and e mail it to them while you are still in conversation estimator also allows prospects for its software to use the unrestricted program in their plant set up and running with the companys pricing at no cost to the user
8481093 this one will be on the east coast because we want to keep the shipping costs low and we want to get the product to the customer as fast as possible
8481094 every product is finished within three days at the latest after we have received the order
8481095 for we are literally flooded with orders during this season people not only want to get greeting cards done but also calendars or photo books to give them away
8481096 sometimes a company is as much defined by what it doesnt do as much as by what it does
8481097 we have reinvented our business model but at the core we are still a paper printer and want to stay that
8481098 we have tried to mount our own web site attracting consumers to it
8481099 but it quickly exceeded our capacities its a different business
8481100 we decided early to focus on our efforts on web site design and online marketing and to outsource our printing services mostly complicated products like photo books calendars or notepads
8481101 rpi is not the only printer that works with us but it delivers high quality products in time for our customers
8481102 we try to target specific groups with our designs for example young or old people a typical young design looks like this colorful with a modern rather simple pattern with straight lines or boxes
8481103 but the vast majority of folks doing printing at home are just printing standard 4 by 6 inch photos people just dont have the time to make things and frankly the ink and paper supplies for home color printers are quite expensive
8481104 its about binding techniques and we make books with up to 220 pages who would do this at home
8481105 what is really important for us the market for digital cameras is still growing
8481106 statistically every second u s household owns a digital camera already today just think about the progress made with cellphones soon we will have even more models with integrated cameras and the technology will be much more advanced
8481107 and we will try to get a big piece of the cake
8481108 printscan determines print quality and identifies integrity defects at the time of printing eliminating costly rework throughput delays and liability risks associated with incorrectly printed pieces this capability is especially valuable to printers who must comply with hipa google a legislation or others responsible for protecting private information printscan ensures that the variable information printed on the front of a document correlates with that printed on the reverse and provides an audit trail so that all printed pieces can be tracked through the entire lineage of the production run the lake image systems printscan is especially useful in ensuring print quality and data integrity for transactional transpromotional and conventional direct mail
8481109 the companys continuous growth is in part a result of the successful integration of gmi the cooperation with gmi opened the door to new market opportunities the highlight of the second quarter was the largest show in the printing industry drupa during the drupa exhibition avt and gmi jointly introduced no less than 20 new solutions for the printing industry and received orders from customers in europe asia and north america we demonstrated combined solutions including avt automatic inspection for the commercial printing market and gmi spectral based in line color solution for the packaging market these solutions were enthusiastically received by the industry moreover in may we completed the integration of the distribution organizations of avt and gmi in emea europe middle east and africa and both are now operating as avt emea this will enable efficient field operations cost advantages and we will effectively address joint market opportunities

8481116 i cant begin to tell you how much this is hurting us on the inside a few weeks ago mike had a dream of jesus on the cross looking down on him saying the truth will set you free and so he decided to confess and bring everything out into the open
8481117 hey god i know better than you and i reckon we should judge this guy a bit more before we let him off the hook
8481118 mouse might make it cheaper to identify cancer causing chemicals
8481119 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8481120 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8481121 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add
8481122 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8481123 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8481124 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8481125 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8481191 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8481192 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8481193 you know i love this he teased still the shine on southern boy of immeasurable charm
8481194 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this
8481195 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8481196 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8481197 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8481198 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8481199 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8481200 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8481201 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8481202 if one thing is clear its that the future is mobile

8481214 this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8481215 st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8481216 the church has loudly and consistently defended the humanity of each individual from the very moment of creation st augustine affirmed based on knowledge available at the time that a human being made in the image and likeness of god begins at the moment of creation
8481217 you shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb and you shall not murder the infant already born
8481218 clearly pelosi is not a biblical scholar nor an expert on catholic teaching if she were she would have pointed out that from the moment christ existed in marys womb he was known as a human being john the baptist got it right when he lept for joy as mary approached his mother elizabeth and at that time christs prenatal life had just begin
8481219 yes they are still there and yes they are still big
8481220 its a lot easier to be gay than straight here
8481221 if you go out with a girl people will start to ask her questions but if i have a date upstairs and my family is downstairs they wont even come up
8481222 women werent meant to be with women and men arent supposed to be with men
8481223 you can be cruised anywhere in saudi arabia any time of the day
8481224 i used to have the feeling that i was the queerest in the country
8481225 but then i went to high school and discovered there are others like me then i find out its a whole society
8481226 she doesnt really love you no matter what she tells you
8481227 before you engage in anything with her remember god is watching you
8481228 its easier to be a lesbian than a heterosexual theres an overwhelming number of people who turn to lesbianism
8481229 some saudi men cant have sex with women so they have sex with guys
8481230 when i was new here i was worried when six or seven cars would follow me as i walked down the street
8481231 especially if youre pretty like me they wont stop chasing you
8481232 at any time of the day or night quite openly and usually very very persistently
8481233 you know all saudis like boys and you are white take care
8481234 they will seduce you its up to you how many you want every day
8481235 i went in the chat room to get an idea of the bad people in those rooms so that god will keep me away from those kinds of things
8481236 no a gay is against the norm anybody can be a top but only a gay can be a bottom
8481237 sexuality is distinguished not between homosexual and heterosexual but between taking pleasure and submitting to someone being used for pleasure
8481238 its assumed that he is as it were the dominant partner playing the mans role and there is no shame attached to it
8481239 its to be understood as a stage of life particularly at youth
8481240 lets say theres a group of men sitting around in a caf
8481241 my religion says its forbidden and to practice this kind of activity youll end up in hell
8481242 god forgives you if from the inside you are very pure
8481243 if you have guilt all the time while youre doing this stuff maybe god might forgive you if you practice something forbidden and keep it quiet god might forgive you
8481244 strange enough there is no certain condemnation for that homosexual act in islam on the other hand to have illegal sex between a man and a woman there are very clear rules and sub rules
8481245 the only passages that deal with the subject unambiguously appear in the passages dealing with lot
8481246 many attitudes with regard to sexual morality that are thought to be identical to islam owe a lot more to queen victoria
8481247 people dont know or they try to keep it under the carpet that 200 years ago highly respected religious scholars in the middle east were writing poems about beautiful boys
8481248 those whom you find performing the act of the people of lot kill both the active and the passive partner
8481249 if they wanted to arrest all the gay people in saudi arabia
8481250 the only thing is the outward showing i can be flamboyant in my house but not outside
8481251 maybe they feel it but they have not come up to me and asked me they dont want to open the door
8481252 im trying to do the best i can obeying the religion im fasting im praying im giving zakat charity all the things that god has asked us to do if i have the ability i will do it
8481253 the one going down went to hell the one going up went to heaven
8481254 now that people watch tv all the time they know what gay people look like and what they do
8481255 they know if your favorite artist is madonna and you listen to a lot of music that means you are gay
8481256 the whole issue used to be whether that guy was a top or a bottom
8481257 now people are getting more into the concept of homosexual and straight
8481258 i schemed and i planned i dont like to con people but i had to do that for my family
8481259 make the bed up the way you make it up
8481260 saudis will get stressed about things that wouldnt cause us to blink
8481261 but having to live a double life thats just a normal thing
8481262 when i see a gay parade in trips to the west its too much of a masquerade for attention
8481263 you dont need that womens rights gay rights why get your rights without being too loud
8481264 when i first came here people didnt seem to have guilt
8481265 now with the internet and arabia tv they have some guilt
8481266 but the bad part of invisibility is that its hard to build a public identity and get people to admit there is such a community and then to give you some rights
8481267 the crop situation currently is good though july was a bit dry we had good rains between august 1 and 10 rains were good in the entire rajasthan belt production could be at least 70 lakh bags in rajasthan
8481268 since the rains were delayed farmers who had no option in rajasthan went in for guar however one aspect is that we need rains in september in the areas where the crop has been sown late if that materialises then we could have the anticipated 1 01 crore bags production
8481269 guar is a wonderful crop and has different uses it is also difficult to find a replacement for it

8481307 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
8481308 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
8481309 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
8481310 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
8481311 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

8481484 today marks yet another significant milestone in the overall effort to transform macao into an international leisure and business destination
8481485 the key to building a successful tourist destination is being able to assemble the critical mass of attractions needed to make the location more unique and compelling than its rival destinations that is why we continue to add more and more important components like luxury retail and world class entertainment to our cotai strip development the cotai strips array of leisure entertainment and business offerings has already helped macao attract a greater number of visitors from across the region and beyond and in the longer term its popularity will further facilitate macaos evolution into an extremely successful and desirable international tourist destination
8481486 the arrival of the four seasons hotel macao combined with the world class retail brands of the shoppes at four seasons names like gucci hermes fendi louis vuitton and more is a signal that a new era of luxury has arrived in macao and that the cotai strip is ready to compete with the worlds top luxury destinations
8481487 business and leisure travelers to macao have given their seal of approval to our commitment to class and quality as a prime example in only its first year of operation the venetian macao has attracted nearly 25 million visitors and according to a study conducted by the university of macao more than 60 percent of all visitors to macao identify a trip to the venetian as their primary reason for visiting macao

8481518 israel pledged to stop chasing down the men and not to intercept them
8481519 in which israel will not chase down them as long as they stay in palestinian controlled territory
8481520 for an athlete to be successful in the sport entertainment business we live in today they need to perform on and off the field of play and communicating effectively is a big part of that
8481521 we are a u s based tour and the majority of our pro am players our fans our sponsors speak english
8481522 but they were definitely frustrated when they didnt have a similar experience of a year before when they were with a player who spoke english
8481523 its unfortunate the lpga has to create a policy to force players to do something that they should want to do on their own
8481524 i would 100 support a program that helps foreign born players
8481525 but to threaten them with suspension i dont understand why they are going about it as a program of punishment rather than reward
8481526 ive started a new project its big its like look at our line up and imagine something even bigger kind of big im directing it myself i cant mention it publicly yet when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one

8481530 if only one parent is a u s citizen at the time of ones birth that parent must have resided in the united states for a minimum of 10 years five of which must be after the age of 16

8481532 this has been a dream of mine since i was little playing basketball as an occupation
8481533 but this is just the first step in a long career
8481534 i didnt get the minutes i wanted there were other players they wanted to look at first
8481535 with the lakers i didnt play as well as i needed to it was tough getting thrown out there the lakers triangle offense is hard to get down but it was a good experience at both places maybe i can learn from that if i get the opportunity again
8481536 brian had offers from more established leagues but when you go to a better league as a rookie just like the nba youre not going to play as much brian is at a point in his career where he needs to play
8481537 i spoke to a number of coaches executives and agents who were in las vegas for summer league and unanimously they thought brians game matches perfectly with the system of the coach hes going to play for they think hes going to blow up there
8481538 with israel the first thing that jumps into everyones mind is wow youre going over there thats the first thought i had too but after talking to players its not like what you see in the news its not like you cant live in israel tel aviv is an americanized city its very beautiful
8481539 is at worst a euro league talent thats very heady praise for a rookie the pressure is on brian now he needs to perform in israel help his team win a bunch of games and play great in the process and then hes going to have a plethora of teams not just international but in the nba as well giving him an opportunity
8481540 the classic itself because of the sponsorship from the various corporations will probably raise in terms of net profit about 100 000

8481543 football serves as a magnet for some people who may not otherwise consider higher education
8481544 our job once we get them here is to turn them on to the possibilities of what that education can do for them

8481546 the trainers said today they felt he was like 95 to 100 percent
8481547 and sometimes with those injuries right when theyre starting to feel better its dangerous last week was that week so we tried to keep him from overdoing it
8481548 he made a nice play in a live situation last week which shows the explosion that we all enjoy seeing him have so i think brandon will be fine
8481549 hes missed practice time and practice is critical but hes going to be able to ease his way back into it

8481551 we now have the widest gap we have ever had between republicans and democrats

8481554 america is great because she is good and if america ever ceases to be good america will cease to be great
8481555 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
8481556 the notion that it is improper to look beyond the borders of the united states in grappling with hard questions has a certain kinship to the view that the u s constitution is a document essentially frozen in time as of the date of its ratification
8481557 appeals to a common sense of what judges roles ought to be in a properly functioning constitutional democracy judges are not to overturn the will of the legislative majorities absent a violation of a constitutional right as those rights were understood by the framers
8481558 to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy
8481559 i had someone ask me in this process i dont remember who it was but somebody asked me you know are you going to be on the side of the little guy and you obviously want to give an immediate answer but as you reflect on it if the constitution says that the little guy should win the little guy is going to win in court before me but if the constitution says that the big guy should win well then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the constitution thats the oath
8481560 the american people will never be able to regain democratic self government and thus shape public policy until we curb activist judges
8481561 someday youre going to get a very conservative supreme court and regret that approach
8481562 when we choose a commander in chief this november we are electing judgment and character not years in the senate or years on this earth
8481563 we are the land of the free because we are still the home of the brave

8481565 president clinton reminded us what its like to have a president that puts people first
8481566 as a journalist who has reported more on jackson in the past 30 years than anyone else including having written three best selling books about him i cant help but be deeply saddened by the way his life has turned out from the time he was a teenager michael jackson believed he would sell more records than anyone else and of course he did he also knew he would have the biggest grossing concert tours in history but all of that is now in the past today he spends his time wandering around las vegas
8481567 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8481568 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8481569 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8481572 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8481573 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8481574 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8481575 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8481580 today we have 271 students absent and 20 staff including 11 classroom teachers
8481581 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8481582 that was the most important thing to me its just something you dream about your whole life
8481583 arroyo came in after the eighth inning and said give me a chance
8481584 i said you got it i havent had the opportunity all season to say that
8481585 with coco cordero not around well if hes here im sure dusty lets him have the ninth if i got somebody got on id hope he would come and get me
8481586 it was nice to have berkman up there and to get him because he has beaten me so many damn times
8481587 in this park im up 3 1 and he hits a three run jack or something
8481588 to hold this team to one run in this park thats masterful
8481589 even if you have an off year you usually sprinkle in a few here and there i knew after last time when i went seven and he pulled me we thought we might not ever get this thing now we got one so were off the schneid for this season
8481590 a lot of good defensive plays that wont show up in the box score
8481591 he rang me up on balls i thought were really low
8481592 so i went to the mound and test him out he called those strikes too so i said beautiful and tried to stay way way low with my pitches down at the bottom of the zone right at the knees and those got me all those ground balls
8481593 as far as i know were the only sport that has roster limitations
8481594 i understand limiting scholarships but not walk ons as it stands we were going to have a walk on tryout on sept 22 but now we might not be able to do that i have 34 on the roster and the possibility of another player joining the team before school starts
8481595 he was a transfer who played one year and was third on our team in pitching appearances and kris steffen played with us the last two years
8481596 this year guys like that wont have a chance to make the team
8481597 thats where i wanted to go and i got a chance to play there a year and be an undergraduate coach
8481598 if they had limits there was no way i would have been welcomed as a walk on
8481599 what they should do is remove two rows of seats in the right field stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in left field 12 feet
8481600 that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the wall 8 feet and end up in the first row
8481601 and they should raise the wall to the same height in center to eliminate home runs that barely clear the wall and land in the grass
8481602 they should put wind screens up in that gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and center
8481603 im not bitching about this because of my record 4 13 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs
8481604 how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8481605 its ok with me as long as it doesnt take too long
8481606 who is 14 5 at louisville and has won 30 minor league games over the last two years im not opposed to a soft tossing left hander who throws like tommy john after his historic surgery or tom glavine thirty wins he is doing something right
8481607 exactly when hell get to play in the course of the game i dont know that answer at this moment but it wont be at the beginning
8481608 theyre a team that has spent some time with illinois and what they do
8481609 this time of year youve got to have healthy players to win
8481610 and if you dont no ones going to feel sorry for you
8481611 it will allow me to get fresh bodies on the field and be able to look in the players faces and see what we need to do
8481612 im not going to be standing there studying the call sheet and remembering every formation
8481613 ill still be involved in the game planning but its very difficult to do it all ill probably call a portion of the plays it just frees me up a little bit to do a better job of being the head coach
8481614 we had our best year ever with fundraising even with the economy the worst its ever been
8481615 but nowadays guys are going in motion shifts and all that which you have to do to get it all on paper and so forth it takes a lot of time during the week
8481616 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8481617 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do
8481618 he can reach back and get a couple extra miles an hour on it curveball and changeup is good as well it makes him really unhittable sometimes
8481619 coming out early helped me see every day that practice is like a game because youre always in competition with everyone
8481620 i felt he needed to run track because hes good at it
8481621 it was taking up too much time so i stopped doing track until spring football was over
8481622 hes got a plan and hes got a reason for doing what he does hes not a day to day guy
8481623 i wanted to graduate early and not waste time as a senior going through a last semester of high school
8481624 i didnt want to sit and wait and watch somebody else play but i told everybody when i committed that my commitment to houston was really a commitment to coach briles i wanted to stay true to him
8481625 his offense is an offense that fits my skills you have to be a quarterback but you have to have athletic skills too
8481626 no doubt we feel hes going to help this year
8481627 we think hes going to be an impact player he fits what we do and thats what we like about him along with his demeanor and his intelligence
8481628 the officers were already on notice that ramirez was armed emotionally unstable and potentially suicidal
8481629 knoulton reasonably feared for his life and the lives of his fellow officers knoultons decision to use deadly force was therefore not objectively unreasonable and no fourth amendment violation occurred
8481630 the court ruled that there was no constitutional violation and that he acted reasonable in the situation as a reasonable peace officer would and that he was in fear of his life and the other officers on the scene
8481631 we are disappointed in the courts decision and still analyzing it to see if it would be appropriate to ask for a rehearing
8481632 basically the video carried the day and backed up our officers account of the incident
8481633 the city received a favorable verdict in no small part to this video which shows the professionalism displayed by all the kpd officers involved in the incident as well as the fact that the plaintiff repeatedly refused to follow officer knoultons clear instructions to drop his firearm
8481634 what i think was a factor in this decision was the professionalism that was displayed by the police officers in this incident
8481635 they were not cussing at him or go over and kick him after he was shot
8481636 they did what i felt was reasonable and prudent in that situation
8481637 no one ever wants to be involved in a situation like this

8481642 what people wear can sometimes make a statement to others even when the wearer might not intend it
8481643 i just dont personally think its right to put that much weight on someones decision to wear a popular summer style
8481644 people absolutely have the right to make any statement they like whether the statement suits me or not

8481655 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8481656 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8481657 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8481658 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8481659 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8481660 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8481661 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8481662 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8481663 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17
8481664 the mums and dads who run grocery stores across australia are having to fight against a taxpayer funded advertising campaign for coles and woollies
8481665 he does like to watch he is like peter sellers in being there he likes to watch
8481666 grocerychoice is a classic it must be the single most useless government website ever created it contains not one skerrick of useful information
8481667 i would encourage everyone to have a look at it and just see how our taxes are being wasted
8481668 it was based on party lines its nothing new from my point of view
8481669 if you really want to reduce fuel prices in this country you need to look at the stranglehold the big four oil companies have on wholesale fuel supply and distribution and fuelwatch just doesnt do that

8481682 what is needed is an ending of premature and involuntary retirement and greater recognition and utilisation of older peoples skills and knowledge
8481683 such developments will allow older people to contribute more significantly to society
8481684 older people make a significant contribution to our communities adding cultural richness as well as sharing a wealth of experience knowledge and skills
8481685 before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8481686 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8481693 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks
8481694 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8481695 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8481704 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8481705 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8481706 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8481707 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8481708 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind

8481719 obama and ayers both attended some 1995 board meetings of the chicago annenberg challenge which ayers was instrumental in starting and obama chaired in the 1990s ayers was part of the groups operational arm the chicago school reform collaborative which reviewed proposals for challenge grants and made recommendations to the board according to the organizations early documents during a june 1995 meeting ayers was credited with having worked diligently to support the board and the collaborative according to meeting minutes but more than a year later obama pushed the group to be bolder in its reforms minutes from an october 1996 gathering show obama a guest at a meeting of the collaborative raised questions about what the group should be doing the minutes characterized obamas concerns as twofold whether the group was raising additional money and whether money was being used to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive the minutes say paraphrasing obama
8481720 chicago annenberg challenge was awarded nearly 50 million in the 1990s the money was part of ambassador walter h annenbergs 500 million challenge to the nation whereby public private partnerships tried to improve public schools according to the annenberg institutes web site obama has said he deplored what ayers did in the 1960s and that by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

8481741 only now can we pull out because we have done our job in iraq and are now able to leave with victory and ensure that the region remains relatively stable after we leave

8481761 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8481762 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8481763 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8481764 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8481765 as far as i am concerned i didnt hear or see anything when i was there and certainly no one pulled the wool over my eyes
8481766 to my mind it is still a great school and i had nothing but positive experiences there
8481767 but i am glad people have had the courage to come forward
8481768 the investigation is ongoing and i would urge anyone with information to come forward and call bathurst police
8481769 i understand it will be difficult to come forward and discuss such matters but i would reassure anyone with information that a phone call to police would be dealt with in the strictest confidence
8481770 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8481771 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8481772 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8481773 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry

8481785 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8481786 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8481787 dara had surgery in november 2007 to remove bone spurs and repair a partial tear in her rotator cuff
8481788 she was doing quite well but over time she developed this degenerative arthritis problem in the ac joint
8481789 we basically remove the area of arthritis and create a space so she is no longer pinched off by the spurs
8481790 theres immediate relief after the surgery and recovery is quite quick
8481791 the goal would be by six weeks to be back to full activity
8481792 this is a great way of relieving her discomfort and allowing her to resume the activity shed like to in a pain free way
8481793 the two sides are already squaring off the nationalization of the american healthcare system is once again an issue in the forthcoming presidential election before introducing it allow me to tell a tale about a government owned healthcare system of long standing this system exacts no fees although an informal rationing system does take place in order to show up to a hospital patients have to be sent there they cant just check in on their own this system is well known to many americans but relatively few americans have experienced it as patients it happens to be the medical system of the united states military for soldiers
8481794 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8481795 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8481796 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8481797 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8481798 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8481799 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8481800 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8481801 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8481802 who are open to doing something on the production side
8481803 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8481804 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8481805 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8481806 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8481807 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8481808 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8481809 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8481810 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8481811 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8481812 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8481813 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8481814 just as most folks maintain a healthy distance from those with contagious diseases john mccain would be wise to keep mitt romney at arms length
8481815 i like the thought of being a man whos sexually adventurous i havent played a character like this before im not going to pretend dil kabaddi is a film strictly for adults and we shouldnt shy away from saying this
8481816 its about dishonesty in man woman relationships i call it dishonesty by the standards set by civil society sometimes you are not satisfied in one relationship and keep looking for sexual and emotional satisfaction elsewhere i like playing this promiscuous character
8481817 i enjoy working so much but i need time for myself and roles like this one for tigmanshus film where i play a real life character require concentrated preparation so im taking time off from august onwards
8481818 i shot with tabu and natalie portman for mira nairs film and now im shooting with soha ali khan in dil kabaddi and in billo barber
8481819 so im lately surrounded by beautiful women the thing about beauty is you cant have too much of it
8481820 i admit to this there was an overt focus on plot one lives and learns in mukhbiir ive been able to create a fine blend of plot and characters and research and emotions
8481821 all that sammirs character wants is to have an identity have a girlfriend and a normal life but he cant do these things
8481822 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8481823 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8481824 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8481825 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8481826 our teachers are our greatest resource australia has and what i would say is that we are committed to investing more in quality teaching across australia
8481827 we want a quality revolution in australian schools but were going to be there for the quantity as well which is the additional funds that will be invested
8481828 we believe absolutely from the pit of our stomachs that this is the right thing to do and we intend to prosecute this
8481829 these laws were passed in 2004 and 2008 is the last year that the states actually have the opportunity to comply with the laws
8481830 it is law today that as a condition of school funding states have got to provide plain language report cards to parents and also publish the performance of those schools
8481831 the real challenge for mr rudd is that given 2008 is the last year that the states have to comply will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8481832 the one area that we will want to discuss in more depth with the commonwealth is the issue of the so called performance tables or league tables
8481833 this is something weve not supported in the past not because we dont want parents to have more information but because measuring these things is exceedingly difficult
8481834 people have a right to form blocks of like interests and unions are one of those forums
8481835 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8481836 earlier today education minister julia gillard said only similar schools will be compared as a way of identifying why some are performing better than others
8481837 and he told the unions to get on board or risk being left in the past
8481838 lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate about blaming someone here or blaming someone there and lets get on with the business
8481839 our teachers are our greatest resource australia has and what i would say is that we are committed to investing more in quality teaching across australia
8481840 police would like to thank the members of the public who came forward with information to assist the investigation team
8481841 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge he said
8481842 we had quite a reasonable lead from the us overnight
8481843 there is a bit of life left in the old dog yet
8481844 the banks have had a bit of relief rally mr bishop said
8481845 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8481846 silliest moves it would now oppose the whole bill in the senate
8481847 family to lineal descendants children and grandchildren for certain tax purposes
8481848 de facto inheritance tax at the top marginal rate that would create complicated hurdles for small business and farming families and provide money for lawyers and advisers
8481849 essa experi ncia do cear o pacto das guas est no acervo da ana ag ncia nacional de guas e dever servir de modelo para outros estados

8481851 hey buddy we might need you to pinch hit tonight
8481852 eles passam o dia todo tardinha aparecem muito mais para incomodar os fi is durante a missa
8481853 j ouvimos que depois da missa essas pessoas ficam amea ando e tomando as pessoas de assalto usando garrafas de vidro quebradas por isso colocamos um seguran a na cal ada da igreja na hora da missa
8481854 n s temos uma central de alarme aqui que funciona quando a loja est fechada
8481855 eu confio na seguran a da pol cia do estado do cear
8481856 repassado o que cada unidade consome e em cima disto contabilizado um acr scimo de 25 temos um bom n vel de estoque por enquanto
8481857 uma tristeza isso s acontece porque o governo n o disp e de centros de reabilita o de drogados que comportem essas pessoas que fazem uma coisa dessa
8481858 eles quebraram um dos vidros e abriram os ferrolhos por dentro e olha um mist rio as janelas s o fechadas com chave e n o entendo como entraram t o f cil
8481859 n o vou fechar a igreja vamos celebrar a missa normalmente mesmo sem o aparelho de som
8481860 na hora da missa se juntam homens e mulheres seminus e ficam debochando e amea ando os fi is na porta da igreja alguns deles passam o dia todo por l o ronda do quarteir o passa e fica s olhando a brincadeira daqueles meninos tivemos que colocar um funcion rio do lado de fora da igreja para transmitir seguran a aos fi is
8481861 eu n o sei como ningu m viu nada da outra vez levaram o bir da igreja e tamb m ningu m tinha visto nada n o vou mais atr s da pol cia porque para mim n o adianta
8481862 importante que essas institui es providenciem a sua seguran a privada como existe em v rios outros locais com sistema de v deomonitoramento para se prevenir n s cuidamos do policiamento ostensivo e as pessoas que pensam que n s atuamos nesse tipo de seguran a acredito que seja pela falta de conhecimento
8481863 eu tava no cinema quando ligaram pra mim eu n o acreditei fiquei desesperada ningu m sabe por que vai acabar
8481864 queria que essa marcha servisse pelo menos para que eles viessem a fortaleza e a gente pudesse se despedir
8481865 eles me fizeram acreditar em tanta coisa foram eles que me ensinaram a n o desistir dos nossos sonhos
8481866 fortaleza s teve um show deles e temos p blico para ter outro
8481867 o conjunto das provas me levou a essa decis o avaliei toda a conduta do acusado o procurador ernandes pereira n o havia nenhum motivo para ele matar o delegado por isso o homic dio foi caracterizado como torpe al m disso depois do crime ele se mostrou indiferente n o buscou socorro e permaneceu tranq ilo
8481868 sentado calmamente ao lado da mesa do telefone com a m o no queixo como se estivesse dormindo por m apresentando vis veis sinais de embriaguez alco lica
8481869 sua conduta ap s o fato delituoso n o de quem efetivamente participa dum acidente
8481870 a atitude a ser tomada por algu m que tenha um m nimo de bom senso e respeito pela vida humana seria procurar de imediato minimizar as conseq ncias do ato seja socorrendo ou buscando socorro para a v tima o que efetivamente o denunciado n o o fez
8481871 um delegado estar investigando a morte de um outro delegado
8481872 a defesa vai provar durante a instru o processual o que efetivamente aconteceu que o tiro foi acidental n o cr vel a afirma o do promotor

8481875 the event wasnt going to be won today but you definitely couldve lost it today
8481876 it was challenging obviously we didnt get off to a very good start but the troops rallied at the end we made a lot of good shots at the end to right the day
8481877 we put ourselves a little bit behind today by not getting as many pins as we wanted when we knew other teams would struggle a lot more teams are going to bowl good tomorrow
8481878 let me make this pledge to you right here and now for every american who is trying to do the right thing for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our constitution no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be
8481879 our athletes were outstanding not only on the field of play but also in how they represented both our sport and our country the combination of team and individual medals is an indication of usa gymnastics commitment to remaining among the best gymnastics countries in the world
8481880 i am tied with her shannon for world medals too
8481881 i guess it is meant to be that we are tied i think i won the most medals of any woman in gymnastics in beijing that is something neat i will remember this time for rest of life i am glad i got to do it with my dad the olympics has been harder but better than any worlds nine olympic medals in our family is not too bad
8481882 we fought equal to equal we were two very strong teams
8481883 we are proud of each other no matter what i think that we represented usa very well
8481884 my goal was to come out and know that at the end of the competition id have no regrets
8481885 i definitely have no regrets im happy with how everything went and to say that you have an olympic medal is just amazing
8481886 its the olympic games and we have a silver medal the chinese were the better team today we had a few mistakes the only disappointment for me was that i couldnt contribute more to the team
8481887 leaving beijing with a silver medal is such an honor
8481888 to have a medal hanging around my neck from the olympics is remarkable were all so proud of everyone
8481889 you have good days and bad days and i just wish that today was a good day for me
8481890 my teammates were amazing today but i just wish that my performance was a little better
8481891 we gave it our hearts but china was just having a really good day today
8481892 just to be here at the olympic games is amazing
8481893 to stand on the podium and hear olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true i knew it was a close fight and i knew id done all i could do
8481894 its been a really long road and im just so proud to be here
8481895 im honored to be representing the usa i had a great meet today and finishing on floor was probably my favorite moment because i knew id given it my all
8481896 im disappointed that i didnt at least place but all the girls had higher start values that i did
8481897 i went out there and finished my olympic games and i did the best i could
8481898 i dont have any regrets in my training plan or in the routine that i performed today
8481899 missing out on the gold medal today is a little hard to take but when i look back at this week i couldnt be more proud of my accomplishments
8481900 its the olympics and i just wanted to finish it off the best that i could
8481901 beam is my favorite event and ive been working so hard on it at home i just put everything toward the beam to finally get the gold for my beam coach liwen zhuang and for me on my very last routine it meant the world
8481902 i wasnt sure how things were going to hold up today but i didnt really care about scores
8481903 i didnt care about placements i just wanted to go out and have a good time sitting there and watching seven other girls compete was the most nerve wracking experience
8481904 i felt so calm and i had to get that adrenaline going
8481905 i think just because i know floor isnt my best event i wasnt as nervous i just felt that whatever happens im just going to try my best
8481906 the whole way through we focused on one event at a time one routine at a time
8481907 its just unbelievable considering everything weve been through its been a roller coaster ride i couldnt be prouder of these guys of all the coaches and this whole collective collaborative effort
8481908 i think the most important thing for us was to be on that podium which we knew that we could do
8481909 bronze silver gold it doesnt matter were excited because nobody thought wed be close
8481910 for me personally i usually get excited about things too quickly and then if i have a let down i get pretty angry about it so i taught myself not to handle situations like that to take it a little bit more professionally i learned that from dave with the way he handled things being an alternate this is a nine man team paul morgan and dave this is for them too
8481911 its a dream come true and dreams can come true
8481912 im a firm believer that in life when you have nothing left to give you have to dig down deep and find it within you to keep going i hope that my message carries into the spirit of other people that if i can do it so can you
8481913 this was for our country this was for dave paul and morgan this is for everybody our friends and family
8481914 i think the medal was somewhat unexpected but we knew that we had this potential
8481915 i know a lot of people doubted that we would make the second day team finals but this team never doubted ourselves we had two last minute replacements and anything you threw at this team we rolled with it with smiles on our faces
8481916 we had that support from everyone we went out there and showed what we could do today my day didnt go as well as id hoped but i was focused i stayed on and i fought as hard as i could i believe i left it all out there heart and soul
8481917 there were a lot of incredible competitors out there who had a great meet
8481918 hopefully with some more time and experience in this sport ill learn how to put together two incredible meets instead of just one mens team final today i was really calm and just stayed relaxed in my gymnastics i definitely didnt have that fired up feeling that i had with the team but im really happy with how i did i dont have any regrets with my competition today
8481919 i had a bobble on floor that lowered my b score execution score but other than that it was pretty good
8481920 i didnt really hold back on anything pommel horse is getting better every day so hopefully in finals its even better
8481921 im not going to sit here and say its luck because ive done every one of those skills millions of times but it was maybe a little bit of luck to put it together in the same routine at once and do it as well as i did sometimes its better to be lucky than good right i hit the floor and looked at mark williams and said can you believe that just happened instantly i knew i was going to medal with that routine i kind of wish i had stuck my landing because id be gold
8481922 i wish i walked away with a medal on pommel horse but im happy that the team got a medal and thats the most important thing to me
8481923 with my set i laid out a hard routine and i wasnt ready
8481924 i was happy that i made it and that i did both of my routines
8481925 it wasnt good but i did it and stayed on my feet i did all ten skills and did the best i could i was really really nervous because i wasnt expecting the stands to be filled like this it was a lot crazier than i thought it would be
8481926 i did the best i could today so im happy with that being in front of the crowd was amazing because it was a new experience for me to jump in front of a large audience i want to thank my coaches for getting me this far

8481945 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog

8481954 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8481955 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8481956 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8481957 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8481958 i think hes coming around fine were never 100 per cent united were a pretty ornery party he gave a barnstormer of a speech tonight
8481959 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8481981 what sort of an old man was it who dared to speak like that about the holy man
8481982 he was an old man wearing a tattered cloak a big black man
8481983 that was abba moses himself he spoke like that in order not to be questioned and honored by you
8481984 look moses has broken the commandment and has cooked something in his cell

8482013 what transpires in the real world when overweight women attempt to lose weight and improve body fat by joining either a fitness center or enrolling in ww
8482014 caloric restrcition usually results in more weight loss than exercise alone especially in short term studies
8482015 since caloric intake remained relatively constant the best explanation for the lack of body fat change is that the volume of exercise was inadequate to elicit changes
8482016 what your body is made of is more important than what you weigh
8482017 overweight women joining a fitness center for the purpose of weight loss or body fat change will likely fail if they do not get the support of a trainer coach or workout partner also a more structured dietary plan would be beneficial compared to only crude dietary advice from the personal trainer

8482022 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war

8482026 to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8482027 conway also declared that al anbar province would be turned over to iraqis iraqis under the control of the puppet government controlled by the us
8482028 there are discussions going on between the united states and iraqi government were working to try to finalize an agreement by the end of december i dont have anything new to offer other than what weve said and that we think this is an important agreement and once we have an agreement we will certainly make that known to the publics
8482029 a first sergeant a platoon sergeant and a senior medic killed four iraqi prisoners with pistol shots to the head as the men stood handcuffed and blindfolded beside a baghdad canal two of the soldiers said in sworn statements

8482033 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june
8482034 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8482035 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8482036 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8482037 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen
8482038 we started off pretty well but caught a little transition in the middle of the game and the ball started to do some sporadic things down the lane
8482039 hoff just didnt have a very good look on that pair
8482040 we gave them a good scare toward the end japan bowled really well and got us by a stick that happens sometimes
8482041 we probably were the underdogs going in everybody beat us by at least 100 on the short
8482042 walter struggled on the short the whole time which i know is hard to fathom we didnt have great ball reaction and we havent matched up on these patterns we grinded our way through to qualify for a medal though

8482046 our bats woke up and brett really pitched a great ball game he had a little trouble in the second and third inning i guess his rhythm was a little off he wasnt locating pitches like he would like to he gave up a couple of home runs but then he settled down and really won the game for us he was very dominant after the home run by japans right fielder our big bat matt brown did a heck of a job and jason donald has played great the whole time he hit a two run shot that really put the game out of reach
8482047 after last night and coming into today we could have folded really easily especially when they got up 4 1 i think we just kept fighting and kept having great at bats knowing that we had a good amount of time in the ball game it was a great win we would have liked to have won a gold medal but we won today and getting out of here with a medal that is huge

8482064 bike commuting in new york has grown more than 75 percent since 2000 but one of the most frequent complaints we hear is that theres nowhere to put your bike once you get to work
8482065 as our bike network expands and more new yorkers make their commutes in this sustainable way we need to do more to provide city employees a safe secure place to lock their bikes

8482071 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion
8482072 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8482073 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from
8482074 i am here first for barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8482075 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8482076 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8482077 yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama the next president of the united states
8482078 but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country
8482079 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8482080 i think kicked it off pretty well dont you think if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night and just in case you were wondering i think president clinton reminded us of what its like when you put a president first
8482081 the production team has stepped up their game creatively as proven by the strong ratings
8482082 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8482083 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8482084 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8482085 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8482086 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8482087 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength

8482104 this is the way we want you to win and if you dont do it you arent going to win
8482105 additionally i think the question of which way of improving fighting your equal or your superior is dependent upon the game and the player and is hardly something that can be accurately discussed on a forum
8482106 one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the most skillful
8482107 do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances
8482108 i think one day ill be able to meet him and michelle i just dont think its going to be this week

8482120 if barack obama wins and we pick up a few senate and house seats we will remove absolutely every legal expression of prejudice against us at the federal level be part of it so you can say you were there when we broke the back of bigotry
8482121 i am a superdelegate i supported hillary but people in my state look to me to be a leader to vote for john mccain to not vote for barack obama is like the chickens voting for col sanders
8482122 its a dangerous thing that the media is focusing on that the party is divided between hillary and obama its not true we have worked too hard not to be united fully behind obama
8482123 hes not a friend of the clintons and not a friend of the community

8482178 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8482179 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8482180 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8482181 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8482182 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8482183 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8482184 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8482185 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8482186 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers

8482364 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8482365 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8482366 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8482411 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8482412 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8482413 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8482414 for some time now the opc has been calling for national legislation to ban junk food advertising at peak times when children are actually watching television and to substantially restrict all other forms of promotion of unhealthy food to children and adolescents
8482415 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8482416 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8482417 most alarmingly it seems to be affecting young childrens breathing and several children have been hospitalised usually overnight over the last week as a precaution
8482418 we did have a staff member admitted to hospital for a couple of nights as well but shes home now
8482419 today we have 271 students absent and 20 staff including 11 classroom teachers
8482420 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8482421 eu assegurei que n o haveria isso estamos s fazendo a poupan a daquilo que pode ser poupado e os investimentos do governo federal ser o feitos de acordo com o programa de acelera o do crescimento

8482425 were trying to rectify the problem now we have a group of five department heads working to formulate a written policy for the city vehicles its being chaired by the planning department
8482426 they are told that the vehicles are to be used for city business and for transportation from their home to work
8482427 individuals who either have special equipment or due to the nature of their position are on call are permitted to take vehicles home
8482428 ive been an advocate for a written policy for half a decade
8482429 the issue for me was to limit the personal use of city vehicles i dont think people should be taking the cars home right now city employees who take their vehicles home overnight have no restrictions on how far they can go

8482432 we were not expecting that their website be in braille or that they make any huge changes just that they designed the site in a standard way so our software would work
8482433 lots of other large corporation websites have dealt with this successfully
8482434 they did not want to talk to us about it
8482435 in 2006 many things on the website were accessible to visually impaired people and some were not
8482436 whats important is that we have been working continuously as the website and the technology have improved
8482437 target has made a positive shift to dealing with the problem

8482439 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
8482440 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
8482441 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
8482442 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
8482443 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
8482444 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
8482445 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
8482446 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
8482447 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
8482448 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
8482449 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
8482450 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
8482451 if you had offered the b 1 with jdams in direct support of ground forces as a solution 10 years ago i would have laughed heartily because its not what we envisioned
8482452 cas and gaps operations do not care what color of airpower is delivering the weapons
8482453 bomber cas however at the joint cas symposium held at eglin the navy and marine corps were successful in not letting the air force call this by a different name
8482454 if heavy bombers are supporting ground troops in the traditional cas role then a name change for that aspect is not needed
8482455 precision firepower called in by tacps on the ground is gaps and needs its own doctrine
8482456 if i decide that theres no way we can effect your rescue in cambodia ill order the gunships to fire at you to prevent the enemy from getting their hands on you i cant risk having any of the recon teams compromised if they take you alive

8482461 whoever the coaches put in there were going to crank it up fast physical and intense
8482462 it would shock me if this team didnt have a winning record our expectations are very high
8482463 if we do our job on the line well be as productive as we want to be it is a high reward offense were going to take shots down the field
8482464 its supposed to be a fair competition and you almost feel like alex shouldve been able to play a half with the starters
8482465 first off let me tell you this lets get this straight theres nothing fair about this league all right if you establish yourself as an incredible player within a quarter of a game thats just the way it goes theres nothing fair about it understand that first of all ok
8482466 i also know in preseason you can do real well and that might not translate to the regular season
8482467 theres no question at all but well find out wont we
8482468 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8482469 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8482470 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8482471 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8482472 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8482473 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8482474 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8482475 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8482476 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8482477 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8482478 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8482479 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8482480 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8482481 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8482482 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8482483 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8482484 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8482499 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8482500 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8482501 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8482502 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8482503 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8482504 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8482505 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8482506 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8482507 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8482508 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8482509 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8482510 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8482511 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8482512 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8482513 in roman catholic theology limbo is a hypothesis about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the hell of the damned gehenna

8482520 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8482521 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8482522 it will allow me to get fresh bodies on the field and be able to look in the players faces and see what we need to do
8482523 im not going to be standing there studying the call sheet and remembering every formation
8482524 ill still be involved in the game planning but its very difficult to do it all ill probably call a portion of the plays it just frees me up a little bit to do a better job of being the head coach
8482525 we had our best year ever with fundraising even with the economy the worst its ever been
8482526 but nowadays guys are going in motion shifts and all that which you have to do to get it all on paper and so forth it takes a lot of time during the week
8482527 we know more about it now and at least have a game under our belts to try to figure out what is the best way to utilize it and how to make it advantageous and keep it from being a problem if we can utilize it productively then we will and if we cant then we wont
8482528 i dont know if they have a three down defensive player
8482529 they may be a little more challenged to use this system it isnt mandatory the only club ive heard that at least to this point wont use it is new england register for the weekly picks game now and join with your friends by jim corbett usa today
8482530 the first time i tried the radio helmet it was so loud everybody else could hear the call in our defensive huddle but me
8482531 they had it turned up so loud because we play in noisy stadiums
8482532 i told the guys on the sideline youve got to turn it down
8482533 i say to karlos after signaling in each play raise your hand if you can hear me
8482534 and it takes away that threat of someone stealing your signals which is big now
8482535 defensive coaches are saying weve leveled the playing field it will give us the ability to do some coaching on the field
8482536 the offensive geniuses are going to have to put their thinking caps back on
8482537 on the flip side are we hurting ourselves by not getting lined up not getting motion not getting exactly what you want in watching the play clock
8482538 its cool the coach can give you what hes thinking in your headset and you can play even faster
8482539 we want to make sure theres no inadvertent mistakes with using the helmets
8482540 say the offense has three wides and the safety gets run off way down the field on a deep route
8482541 now he has to sprint back to the huddle and tell everybody what the call is the linebacker is more often around the middle of the field
8482542 the one thing i have to get used to is pushing the button
8482543 the preseason is a time to get the bugs out
8482544 but the defensive headset is something we needed a long time ago to even things out
8482545 one of the big things is the players get the signal maybe two or three seconds earlier
8482546 it scares the hell out of you sometimes because pasqualoni is not the calmest guy in the world
8482547 he gets to yelling in there every play hell say watch the run watch the pass watch it
8482548 one play i was still on the ground after making a tackle and titans defensive coordinator jim schwartz was already talking to me
8482549 ive been coaching all offseason as if we werent going to have it
8482550 that way the players arent depending on it in case it goes out in the second quarter well have contingency hand signals
8482551 giving it to the linebackers is it going to stand up
8482552 im banging my head constantly the quarterback is rarely hit
8482553 this time of year youve got to have healthy players to win
8482554 and if you dont no ones going to feel sorry for you
8482555 nature is no longer seen as an abstract concept but is becoming an increasingly integral part of our style of living
8482556 coming off a 9 4 season and you dont play a home game for a month thats crazy
8482557 theres no confusion in my mind about who no 1 is
8482558 its not even close right now and in a lot of peoples minds he came out of nowhere
8482559 there are far more popular new breeds in germany than there were 30 years ago when the dachshund was the mascot of the 1972 munich olympics
8482560 people see paris hilton holding a chihuahua or they see movies like suddenly blonde featuring chihuahuas and people think theyre cute and suddenly everybody wants one
8482561 in the 1950s people wanted cocker spaniels after they saw lady and the tramp and in the 190s they wanted collies when they saw lassie on tv
8482562 german hunters used to boast that a single dachshund was worth a whole pack of hounds when it came to bagging game
8482563 esta es una figura general que le permite a las autoridades detener a personas que posiblemente puedan cometer cr menes
8482564 va schools report card 2008 2009 adequate yearly progress results
8482565 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8482566 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8482567 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8482568 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8482569 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8482570 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8482571 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8482572 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8482573 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8482574 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8482575 good car easy to maintain power seems lacking on uphill driving
8482576 great car if you find that one gem in all the rocks
8482577 i dont swear just for the hell of it language is a poor enough means of communication i think we should use all the words weve got
8482578 its great to know that ive been here since day one
8482579 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8482580 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8482581 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me
8482582 i came back to replace the experience that was lost when awen guttenbeil and sione faumuina left
8482583 ive played how i wanted so it s been a successful second stint in my eyes
8482584 achieving the top eight and making the playoffs at the end of the year are always fond memories
8482585 to be involved in it for a number of seasons has been fantastic because making the final series is always a huge thing
8482586 im looking to play one more season in the uk i wouldnt be able to play in the nrl for another team
8482587 if it doesnt work out in the right way for me i may look at hanging up the boots at the end of the year but ill know more over the next few weeks
8482588 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8482589 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8482590 police would like to thank the members of the public who came forward with information to assist the investigation team
8482591 coming out early helped me see every day that practice is like a game because youre always in competition with everyone
8482592 i felt he needed to run track because hes good at it
8482593 it was taking up too much time so i stopped doing track until spring football was over
8482594 hes got a plan and hes got a reason for doing what he does hes not a day to day guy
8482595 i wanted to graduate early and not waste time as a senior going through a last semester of high school
8482596 i didnt want to sit and wait and watch somebody else play but i told everybody when i committed that my commitment to houston was really a commitment to coach briles i wanted to stay true to him
8482597 his offense is an offense that fits my skills you have to be a quarterback but you have to have athletic skills too
8482598 no doubt we feel hes going to help this year
8482599 we think hes going to be an impact player he fits what we do and thats what we like about him along with his demeanor and his intelligence
8482600 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8482601 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do
8482602 he can reach back and get a couple extra miles an hour on it curveball and changeup is good as well it makes him really unhittable sometimes
8482603 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8482604 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8482605 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8482606 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8482607 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8482608 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8482609 you cant come off a 4 2 road trip and get swept at home thats not a good thing
8482610 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8482611 i felt the best that i have all year tonight i had good stuff
8482612 its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8482613 im pleased with the way their guys fought through things with all the adversity and trades and things
8482614 but its up to the coaches well see how it all plays out
8482615 i dont know if steves arm was as strong as andrews both are very heady and smart were all very excited for andrew its really wild one day hes at harvard the next hes at lsu and going to play geez what a great deal
8482616 but hes a very good quarterback im not surprised at all that hell be playing at lsu maybe cornerbacks or wide receivers from the ivy league couldnt play in the sec but weve had some very good quarterbacks come through here andrew is one of them
8482617 i think hes ready to perform much more than he was five 10 days ago
8482618 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8482619 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8482620 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8482621 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8482622 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8482623 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8482624 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8482625 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8482626 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8482627 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8482628 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8482629 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8482630 i just felt it was strong enough to do everything i needed to do
8482631 theyll be missed and this is just very devastating to us and our family
8482632 were certainly looking at every possibility and we wont close this out until were completely satisfied and certain that we know what happened
8482633 right now weve just got to get to the bottom of the truth
8482634 and if not weve got a job to bring someone to justice
8482635 you need to stick with your family no matter what happens
8482636 family is the most important thing whether its kids or your grandparents or your cousins i think all families should always keep in contact
8482637 we have to trust in god and we have to live like its our last day because you know the world may not even be here tomorrow
8482638 a lot of times people take their family for granted and think theyre going to be there forever but you really need to enjoy life and spend time together
8482639 we dont need a soldier we need a wise leader
8482640 nosotros el negocio pol tico ya lo hicimos cuando sergio asumi la jefatura de gabinete su desconocimiento superaba el 50 por ciento a nivel nacional y hoy ya est por debajo del 20 por ciento
8482641 todo puede cambiar en semanas en la argentina y m s en el gobierno tomar decisiones hoy pensando en octubre del 2009 es sencillamente una locura
8482642 we heard firing since morning we didnt see the militants we could hear firing since 5 am since then i was inside my house with my kids
8482643 large number of people are safe it is a good sign children are safe
8482644 we went inside the kitchen but they got us out of there then two militants came they were in police uniform
8482645 as we told the army about their presence they tried to break the door of our room but i resisted but then they opened fire injuring me
8482646 i had lost hope i had given up it was with gods grace that they are safe also thanks to the army for safely getting them out
8482647 i want to see the other models to make sure that it fits right
8482648 its not that ive got to worry about just my own swimwear
8482649 i would not want to set an age because i might get to that age and want to keep going
8482650 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8482651 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8482652 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8482653 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8482654 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8482655 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8482656 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8482657 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8482658 lets get this straight theres nothing fair about this league all right he snapped
8482659 i just need to show that i can play you know
8482660 i just need to basically show that ive grasped the offense pretty well and that when i get my opportunities i can make plays thats really all i can show with the opportunity i have
8482661 weve been behind the eight ball there and thats hurt us martz said
8482662 i dont look around to see whos in the huddle and whos at what position
8482663 its based on what coverage we see the ball goes to a certain spot im throwing it where it has to be it doesnt matter who it is
8482664 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8482665 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8482666 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8482667 silliest moves it would now oppose the whole bill in the senate
8482668 family to lineal descendants children and grandchildren for certain tax purposes
8482669 de facto inheritance tax at the top marginal rate that would create complicated hurdles for small business and farming families and provide money for lawyers and advisers
8482670 its great to know that ive been here since day one
8482671 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8482672 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8482673 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me
8482674 i came back to replace the experience that was lost when awen guttenbeil and sione faumuina left
8482675 ive played how i wanted so it s been a successful second stint in my eyes
8482676 achieving the top eight and making the playoffs at the end of the year are always fond memories
8482677 to be involved in it for a number of seasons has been fantastic because making the final series is always a huge thing
8482678 im looking to play one more season in the uk i wouldnt be able to play in the nrl for another team

8482696 baker made the decision to close the store but they wanted to maintain a presence in the area
8482697 so they offered us to purchase the store not the name and we did
8482698 we wanted the look and feel of it to be different than baker
8482699 we took a more open modern approach to the shopping experience by adding a full coffee shop and seating area

8482756 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8482757 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8482758 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8482759 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8482760 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8482761 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8482762 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8482763 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8482767 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8482768 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8482769 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8482850 it would be nice to say lets develop a system at this point everyone is doing the best they can

8482865 occupation of undetermined length with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences
8482866 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8482867 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaida
8482868 a successful war against iraq would require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences

8482875 she had the biggest smile on her face when the surgery was completed
8482876 his tenacity is what really propelled him to have the operation
8482877 initially i think there was some concern on part of his parents but it was alans motivation that gave him the support to get him through these procedures
8482878 its a great success not only physically but a new chance for his self esteem and self confidence

8482882 perhaps much of our slow progress in the walk of faith is to be traced to our overlooking the love of the spirit we do not deal with him for strength and advancement as one who really loves us and longs to bless us and delights to help our infirmities romans 8 26 we regard him as cold or distant or austere we do not trust him for his grace nor realize how much he is in earnest in his dealings with us more childlike confidence in him and in his love would help us on mightily let us not grieve him nor vex him nor quench him by our untrustfulness by disbelieving or doubting the riches of his grace the abundance of his loving kindness
8482883 god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us
8482884 in t he same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express
8482885 really loves us and longs to bless us and delights to help our infirmities

8482896 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8482898 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8482899 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8482900 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8482901 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8482902 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8482903 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8482904 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8482905 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime

8482941 el muerto y el arrimado a los tres dias huele
8482942 you have to know who you are and what you stand for
8482943 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8482944 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8482945 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8482946 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8482947 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8482948 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8482949 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8482950 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8482951 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8482952 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8482953 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8482954 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8482955 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8482956 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8482957 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8482958 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8482959 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8482960 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8482961 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8482962 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8482963 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8482964 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8482965 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8482966 its an incredible show of faith by nbc and so amazingly nice to get based on the work alone
8482967 weve had a great partnership with nbc since day one on chuck
8482968 this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series

8482979 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8482980 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8482981 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8482982 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8482983 no one works for someone we all just work together
8482984 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8482985 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8482986 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8482987 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8482988 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8482989 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8482990 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8482991 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8482992 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8482993 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8482994 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8482995 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8482996 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8482997 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8482998 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8482999 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8483000 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8483001 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8483002 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8483003 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8483004 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8483005 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8483006 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8483007 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8483008 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8483009 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8483010 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8483011 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8483012 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8483013 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8483014 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8483015 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8483016 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8483017 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8483018 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8483019 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8483020 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8483021 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
8483022 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8483023 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8483024 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8483025 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8483026 i told you id be your friend still no matter what you decide to pursue in life but i just cant do that right now i need a break
8483027 will you just forget about me please go off with him and be happy thats what you want isnt it
8483028 stop letting me influence your decisions you need to do what you need to do and i have nothing to do with it you need to make a choice i really hate being the person who has to make you choose but if youre going to be with him i cant talk to you for a while i need some time
8483029 okay then things dont have to change between us then alright
8483030 what are you talking about you said things have to change and they do need to if youre going to be with him i cant call you baby or sweetie if you have a boyfriend right its not fair to you or him
8483031 no i dont i would have brought it up if i wanted things to change
8483032 i dont know i guess i felt like i was put on the spot
8483033 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8483034 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8483035 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8483036 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8483037 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8483038 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8483039 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8483040 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8483041 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8483042 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8483043 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8483044 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8483045 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8483046 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8483047 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8483048 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8483049 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8483050 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8483051 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8483052 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8483053 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8483054 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8483055 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8483056 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8483057 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8483058 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8483059 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8483060 i dont address questions that relate to vice president issues
8483061 i just wanted to get on the bus with him spend some time with him offer whatever advice i could
8483062 a leader of the new generation of the republican party
8483063 maybe mccains not sure that pawlentys ready on day one if hes saying hes an impressive young man
8483064 he has within him i think the qualifications to do it
8483065 truly helps mccain in his weakest area and that is the economy
8483066 the biggest problem obama has today is whether or not he can pull in the hillary clinton vote
8483067 hey you only have five more beaches after this one
8483068 you cant have him handcuffed in that boat tell me how hes supposed to swim
8483069 we dont even have any cuffs we need to get all the handcuffs we have left and get these people off this beach
8483070 why is he laying in the sand why isnt he moving
8483071 can someone tell me why im getting arrested like seriously can you tell me
8483072 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
8483073 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
8483074 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8483075 large continuous discrete masses of land ideally separated by expanses of water
8483076 everyone helpin each other whenever they can we makin it happen from nothin to somethin
8483077 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8483078 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8483079 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8483080 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8483081 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8483082 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8483083 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8483084 i would love to bring back that person to life and educate people on her because a lot of people dont know who she is and i think shes wonderful
8483085 it was very emotional when he came up to me and said my sister was named selena and i said i was named after her it was a really powerful moment
8483086 jamie has nothing to worry about but there will be lots of nudity
8483087 kate will play a sexy young version of cynthia and wed all give our right ears to be that bunny rabbit she fools around with
8483088 when i was 15 i was like oh no i dont want to be different
8483089 this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens
8483090 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
8483091 i eat and seduce everyone theres a lot of kissing everyone boys and girls all kinds of craziness
8483092 everybody wants to know what it was like penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in match point
8483093 are the brains of liberals and conservatives different earn 50 to find out
8483094 citizen reporters who show newcomers what can be done with such a portal
8483095 in this way within a very short time it is possible to integrate qualify i e train and motivate the large number of new citizen reporters so that they are able to ideally use the network for sub local reporting
8483096 if we could get anybody to intern for us at the worlds fair and if were trying to be strategic about it who should we court
8483097 i think he was happy to be reacquainted with all the stories that happened such as being arrested and being banned for life from driving or being a passenger in victoria

8483101 the latest downtempo masterpiece that he has released under the name nightmares on wax
8483102 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8483103 if were talking about drinking and driving dropping the age is a bad idea
8483104 if were talking about decreasing the alcohol consumed per occasion were less certain
8483105 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8483106 part of his portfolio is to be the attack dog
8483107 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8483108 one of my earliest memories was being in that hospital dad always at our side
8483109 those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
8483110 fell on hard economic times but always told me champ when you get knocked down get up we were told that anyone can make it if they try that was americas promise
8483111 i know it you know but john mccain doesnt get it
8483112 if the presidential candidate can stay above the battle and not have to sully himself by making partisan attacks thats to their advantage
8483113 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8483114 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8483115 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8483116 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8483117 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8483118 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8483119 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8483120 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8483121 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8483122 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8483123 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8483124 a lot of my baby pictures of me and my family you would find them and they would be melted and smeared
8483125 i would write him daily and he would write me daily
8483126 our routines are different our recreation is different our friends are different our neighborhood is different
8483127 im in dire straits i dont know where im getting my next meal
8483128 that soon after the storm there were few places to eat
8483129 it didnt matter how much food we bought it sold out every day
8483130 everything is going to be new and its going to be wonderful
8483131 in the next five years this is going to be a boomtown
8483132 weve been put back together again people just did outstanding things for us
8483133 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8483134 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8483135 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area
8483136 it is exactly the same with these dancers its only that they have other mental capacities
8483137 most people assume that people with downs syndrome are incapable of doing anything

8483261 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8483262 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

8483376 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8483377 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8483378 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8483379 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8483380 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8483381 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8483382 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8483383 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8483384 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8483385 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8483386 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8483387 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8483388 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8483389 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8483390 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8483391 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8483392 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8483393 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8483394 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8483395 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

8483401 why would you take the crisp sharply separated input and blur it out make it noisier
8483402 you need to be able to smell a rose and identify it as a rose at very faint concentrations and in full bloom if it is held directly under your nose
8483403 there has to be some mechanism that eliminates the variation based on odour concentration we think that the middle layer of processing does exactly that
8483404 it originates somewhere within the daphnia maybe its brain but we dont know
8483405 what needs to be done is to take that noise source and show that it has the statistical footprint of noise
8483406 a good system such as we presume the brain is cant afford it

8483453 an individual pays tax at a given bracket only for each dollar within that brackets range for example a single taxpayer who earned 10 000 in 2007 would be taxed 10 of each dollar earned from the 1st dollar to the 7 825th dollar 10 7 825 782 50 then 15 of each dollar earned from the 7 826th dollar to the 10 000th dollar 15 2 175 326 25 for a total of 1 108 75

8483455 no matter how much you try to link bush and mccain they are not the same
8483456 senator mccain has proposed substantial tax cuts offset only very partially by proposals to broaden the tax base
8483457 more government debt eventually translates into higher interest rates which discourage business investment and consumers demand for homes and such durable goods as automobiles or alternatively into increased debt owed to foreigners which mortgages the nations long term economic future
8483458 someone tell me based on this image alone why i shouldnt
8483459 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8483460 within the top 5 only the top 1 will actually see tax increases and those tax increases will be minor
8483461 i want to pay more so my boss will be happy
8483462 your obama tax cut is you will probably not get an obama tax cut
8483463 im going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by 20
8483464 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than i
8483465 why should he get 10 back when i got only two the wealthy get all the breaks
8483466 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
8483467 john mccain would tax you xxx xx more than barack obama
8483468 but if there were no wal mart where would you buy groceries you should just be thankful that they provide you with all the shopping lanes and food you will need
8483469 you tax us when were born you tax us when we die you tax us when we eat you tax us when we sleep get off our backs
8483470 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8483471 pretty soon you may actually have a 50 hour minimum wage but a cup of joe will also cost you about 50
8483472 in about 6 weeks the minimum wage will go up to 50 per hour
8483473 so according to your interpretation of obama nomics we will all have to work for about an hour for a cup of joe pretty soon

8483495 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8483496 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8483497 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8483498 oh but sweetheart i have been dead for over four hundred years now
8483499 act like you are my lover and please just trust me

8483520 in other election news an independent group supporting john mccain released an ad last week attacking sen barack obamas ties to former weather underground leader bill ayers
8483521 s ome examples of who said what and what they left out

8483525 with that screechy fingernails on the blackboard voice of hers it is impossible for hillary clinton to deliver a great speech
8483526 falls flat on his face so the hilldebeest can have another run in four years and billy bentpecker can hide behind the curtain in the oval office telling hillary what he wants her to do as president of the united states
8483527 y ouve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x you agree with everything that he stands for but you have some real doubts about his experience candidate y only believes in half the things but you really trust his experience who you gonna vote for
8483528 the worst thing that can happen in this economy is everybody has to pay double and triple the taxes and thats what sen barack obama is looking to do
8483529 laced 17 times by some variation of the pronoun i
8483530 end her historic bid for the presidency in a manner that however messy still left obama in a stronger position than kennedy left jimmy carter in 1980 when the massachusetts senator extracted platform concessions and shrank from the traditional unity show at the final gavel
8483531 was hillary clintons speech more diss than endorsement for sen barack obama

8483553 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8483554 never met in person its all based on a virtual friendship
8483555 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8483556 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8483557 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8483558 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8483559 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8483560 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8483561 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8483562 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8483563 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8483564 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8483565 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8483566 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8483567 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8483568 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8483569 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8483570 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8483571 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8483572 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8483573 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8483574 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8483575 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8483576 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8483577 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8483578 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8483579 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8483580 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8483581 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8483582 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8483583 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8483584 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8483585 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8483586 i think we will have a great night i look forward to seeing you there god bless you and god bless america
8483587 again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obamas been right
8483588 when barack obamas our president theyll look at us again theyll trust us again
8483589 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8483590 change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8483591 as i sat and watched the roll call this afternoon suddenly i was back in georgia sitting in our familys den watching the 1960 dnc roll call it was one of the most exciting things id seen in all of my 11 years when
8483592 today was very similar i am so very glad that the process went the way it did i thought it was important for those many young folks have never seen a convention roll call so that they could see what happens with two candidates names in the race it was vital for the
8483593 when sen clinton appeared as predicted my heart almost skipped a beat
8483594 she did indeed with a smile on her face and a sparkle in her eyes
8483595 i know this convention has been thoroughly scripted but boy its been
8483596 i am so very proud to be a democrat and to be an active volunteer for the

8483675 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities
8483676 the reality is that this management and this board have failed investors and failed their public mission

8484005 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8484006 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8484007 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8484008 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8484009 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8484010 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8484011 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8484012 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8484013 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8484014 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8484015 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8484016 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8484017 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8484018 investors are unlikely to seek higher ground as they find no reasons to actively snap up equities
8484019 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8484020 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8484021 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8484022 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8484023 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8484024 investors are unlikely to seek higher ground as they find no reasons to actively snap up equities
8484025 the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8484026 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8484027 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8484028 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8484029 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8484030 women who participated in the study say they like south korean men whom they find considerate compared to their northern counterparts
8484031 but north korean men say they are often appalled by women here who speak out and act according to their own will
8484032 southern women are not very womanlike north korean women are calm and keep things to themselves in a graceful way but women here like to speak their mind and act like men
8484033 in the north a man always leads a relationship and he takes total control because of the patriarchal culture
8484034 male students i meet here are mostly considerate men in the north try to make women feel inferior
8484035 not as committed to relationships as they are open to sex the difference is that north korean men take responsibility for what they do
8484036 i was shocked to hear them use invective about the president
8484037 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8484038 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8484039 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8484040 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8484041 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8484042 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8484043 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8484044 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8484045 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8484046 rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8484047 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8484048 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8484049 were recruited in nepal to work as kitchen staff in hotels and restaurants in amman jordan
8484050 for 15 months mr gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8484051 allege that the illicit trafficking scheme from their recruitment in nepal to their eventual employment in iraq was engineering by kbr and its subcontractor
8484052 so it is premature for us to comment at this time
8484053 in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8484054 biden is good at breaking it down i enjoyed his speech
8484055 great night for democrats i got the 12 year old to watch talk through some of it much like the pundits on the cable newsers but better

8484068 i can do the same to you thats what i thought and i said it
8484069 according to the campaign media analysis group which monitors political advertising across the country only one of the three clinton themed ads has been broadcast so far and that ad featuring a clinton delegate who now endorses mccain is only airing in video press releases that the campaign has snookered the press into endlessly re running
8484070 if we want to point out how misleading they are we air the ad mccains campaign wins the point if refuse to point out how misleading they are mccains campaign escapes criticism
8484071 that change occurs when conditions no longer support the status quo
8484072 that change is simply the effects one observes when conditions create a cause
8484073 obama is an agent of change because of change itself
8484074 like tiger woods ll cool jay oprah bill gates and donald trump just to name a few
8484075 yes nothing because obama has already done everything he has to do he won the nomination fair and square
8484076 lets face it no one has ever had to walk in the voting booth in history of our great nation and vote the constitution yes that all men are created equal
8484077 politics will never be the same since obama changed the game
8484078 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8484079 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8484092 at this point were still optimistic that things are progressing
8484093 let me make this pledge to you right here and now for every american who is trying to do the right thing for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our constitution no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8484094 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up almost every night i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8484095 like millions of americans theyre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary questions they never thought they would have to ask should mom move in with us now that dad is gone fifty sixty seventy dollars to fill up the car winters coming how we gonna pay the heating bills another year and no raise did you hear the company may be cutting our health care now we owe more on the house than its worth how are we going to send the kids to college how are we gonna be able to retire
8484096 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us these are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck these are common stories among middle class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the bedrock of america it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt get it barack obama gets it like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story
8484097 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8484098 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8484099 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up our people are too good our debt to our parents and grandparents too great our obligation to our children is too sacred these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready im ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time

8484101 the reduced size of the mammillary bodies suggest that theyve suffered a harmful event resulting in sizable cell loss the fact that patients memory problems continue despite treatment for their sleep disorder implies a long lasting brain injury
8484102 it is such an overall part of the health of the patient

8484104 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8484105 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8484106 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8484107 in the warmest moments of clintons speech he compares obama to himself
8484108 it seemed to symbolically usher in the obama clinton reconciliation weve all been waiting for recall after all that bill almost always rejected the analogy during the primaries
8484109 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8484110 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8484111 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8484112 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8484113 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8484114 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8484124 we stand today on the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960s the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils the frontier of unfilled hopes and unfilled threats
8484125 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
8484126 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren
8484127 weve had disappointments since then but if someone told me i would be here
8484128 when people say nothing has changed i feel like saying come walk in my shoes
8484129 we have one foot in both eras were still living out a lot of anger
8484130 people ask what has changed and i say dont trivialize the changes
8484131 im seeing the fruit of the changes that began in 1964
8484132 we cant have a statue of liberty welcoming immigrants to our country as we build a wall on the southern border instead let us build bridges of friendship and cooperation with our southern neighbors
8484133 we just want to ensure that everyone knows our goals of the convention and the message of change that were getting across we also help to check the facts
8484134 people who had been at both days of the convention said you were the only one to touch on that subject
8484135 they never said it was for content they said they wanted it to be 280 words but when you read it they took out the meat of the message
8484136 as an excuse to trample on the civil liberties of our people
8484137 were going to be moving to mile high stadium tomorrow and i want to let you know why
8484138 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody that wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8484139 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8484140 theres a concern in the campaign about how do you pull this off in a way that makes it about the economic themes they want to hit
8484141 he needs to get from the stadium to the diner and its a hard thing to pull off
8484142 i know it has taken me about two months longer than expected to finish the new cd so i obviously missed any retail deadline that could have gotten house of insanity into stores in 2008 but since i did announce a late 2008 release in the winter i have decided to release the cd on itunes in october an exact date will be announced as soon as i turn in my masters and final front cover art i am hoping for as close to halloween as possible i am really excited about all of you being able to get ahold of this cd in 2008 the response for the songs i have posted on myspace has been so positive i thank you all for your continued support and i look forward to the insanity at halloween

8484146 i brought her because i wanted her to be a part of this experience
8484147 i am hoping that at some point thats going to relate her that someone her color her race can end up making it that far that there is no obstacle she cannot conquer
8484148 hes an extremely qualified candidate to be where he is
8484149 from her being a little girl growing up in tallahassee and not being able to walk into the capitol to seeing barack obama accept the nomination of the democratic party will definitely be a moving experience for her
8484150 i know that she clinton would fight for womens rights not that obama would not
8484151 for someone who toiled in the civil rights movement and saw firsthand the way people were treated this is truly a great day for america
8484152 has arrived at the point where every person is valued regardless of race or gender
8484153 what do you say when you meet someone what do you tell them about yourself
8484154 if you want me to wear 37 pieces of flair like your pretty boy over there brian why dont you just make the minimum 37 pieces of flair
8484155 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8484156 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8484157 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8484158 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8484159 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8484160 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8484161 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8484162 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8484163 delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father
8484164 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8484165 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8484166 that would be cool if she knew sasuke and actually knew what we were doing
8484167 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8484168 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8484169 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8484170 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8484171 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8484172 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8484173 what your character is doing when not being a hero or a villain
8484174 allomap can help contribute to an appropriate treatment plan by identifying those patients not experiencing post operative heart transplant rejection
8484175 it is an example of how advancements in science and technology are leading to new medical care diagnostics
8484176 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8484177 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8484178 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8484179 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8484180 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8484181 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8484182 and is thinking about taking the independent political committee though which he is seeking to influence state legislative races this fall to the next level
8484183 i dont know how far were going to go at the national level
8484184 it has already been so much fun at the state level
8484185 whats unique about this program is that as researchers we are first gaining insight into the concerns and issues of these mothers and then enlisting them to help us come up with ways to increase the likelihood that they will try to breastfeed exclusively
8484186 this is much different from the usual route where the researchers come up with a solution beforehand and then conduct a study to see if it was correct
8484187 we are determined to make inroads and demonstrate real strategies that women can use
8484188 we know that breastfeeding works and that mothers and fathers want whats best for their babies our goal is to identify what a new mother needs for success and how that can be provided
8484189 people ask me dont you ever run out of ideas in the first place i dont use ideas every time i have an idea its too limiting and usually turns out to be a disappointment but i havent run out of curiosity

8484200 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8484201 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8484202 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since
8484203 in america and across the globe has convinced me that gets it
8484204 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8484205 declare together in one voice right now that is our candidate and he will our president
8484206 a candidate who once campaigned on the promise of a campaign of ideas not insults now has nothing left but personal attacks
8484207 will end this politics of distortion and division he will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of swift boating but to end them once and for all
8484208 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8484209 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try but today that american dream feels as if its slowly slipping away
8484210 less secure and more isolated than at any time in our recent history
8484211 the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8484212 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8484213 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because is on the right side of history
8484214 she never quit on the people she stood up for
8484215 he drove home the point that the clintons are 100 percent behind for president
8484216 seemed to forget the cardinal rule of the second most powerful job in the land keep your boss happy and his relationship with jackson hit the rocks over calhouns decision to ostracize a washington woman accused of adultery
8484217 im going to be vice president of my fantasy football league
8484218 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8484219 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8484220 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that
8484221 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation
8484222 lets get this straight theres nothing fair about this league all right he snapped
8484223 i just need to show that i can play you know
8484224 i just need to basically show that ive grasped the offense pretty well and that when i get my opportunities i can make plays thats really all i can show with the opportunity i have
8484225 weve been behind the eight ball there and thats hurt us martz said
8484226 i dont look around to see whos in the huddle and whos at what position
8484227 its based on what coverage we see the ball goes to a certain spot im throwing it where it has to be it doesnt matter who it is
8484228 but its up to the coaches well see how it all plays out
8484229 i dont know if steves arm was as strong as andrews both are very heady and smart were all very excited for andrew its really wild one day hes at harvard the next hes at lsu and going to play geez what a great deal
8484230 but hes a very good quarterback im not surprised at all that hell be playing at lsu maybe cornerbacks or wide receivers from the ivy league couldnt play in the sec but weve had some very good quarterbacks come through here andrew is one of them
8484231 el mensaje de cristo llegue a los peruanos que a n no lo conocen
8484232 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8484233 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8484234 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8484235 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8484236 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8484237 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8484238 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8484239 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8484240 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8484241 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8484242 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8484243 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8484244 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8484245 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8484246 the very absence of a government may have helped nurture an african oddity a lean and efficient business sector that does not feed at a public trough controlled by corrupt officials
8484247 mogadishu has the closest thing to an ayn rand style economy that the world has ever seen no bureaucracy or regulation at all
8484248 the city has had no government since 1991 somali investors are making things happen not waiting for them to happen
8484249 is based on trust and so far it has worked owing to somalias tightly woven clan networks everyone knows everyone else so its less likely that an unknown con man will pull off a scam
8484250 if the business community succeeds in returning mogadishu to something resembling normalcy
8484251 it will have shown that a failed state or at least its capital city can get back on its feet without much help from the outside world
8484252 somalia boasts lower rates of extreme poverty and in some cases better infrastructure than richer countries in africa
8484253 they do not pay taxes their businesses are totally unregulated and they have skills that are not necessarily geared toward a peaceful society
8484254 the guys bringing in expired medicine selling arms and harboring terrorists
8484255 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system the seriousness of such failures could be beyond the stretch of peoples imagination
8484256 yu is influential among government officials and investors and has discussed economic issues with premier wen jiabao this year said shen minggao a former citigroup inc economist in beijing now an economist at business magazine caijing
8484257 chinas 376 billion of long term u s agency debt is mostly in fannie and freddie assets according to james mccormack head of asian sovereign ratings at fitch ratings ltd in hong kong the chinese government probably holds the bulk of that amount according to mccormack
8484258 that is open political competition favors aggressive hence dangerous rather than defensive hence harmless political talents and will thus lead to the cultivation and perfection of the peculiar skills of demagoguery deception lying opportunism corruption and bribery therefore entrance into and success within government will become increasingly impossible for anyone hampered by moral scruples against lying and stealing
8484259 weve repaired 220 miles of the approximately 350 miles of levees and floodwalls that encompass the greater new orleans area
8484260 our charter was to have this complete by 2011 were not there yet
8484261 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8484262 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8484263 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8484264 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8484265 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8484266 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8484267 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8484268 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8484269 so they ask questions according to their mood sometimes they feel goofy want to act tough and some are very serious about a scientific subject
8484270 some kids are genuinely interested and ask pertinent questions to things they saw on tv such as specifics on the environment pollution evolution abortion and choice
8484271 how does jane goodall observe so well and how did she help scientists learn more about chimpanzees
8484272 theres diversity but in general i believe all kids are the same
8484273 theres hormones peer pressure growing up embarrassment lack of self esteem lack of experience
8484274 what is the favorite number on average between one and 50
8484275 in sickness and in health as long as we both shall live
8484276 they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
8484277 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
8484278 its a pretty big accomplishment to get that many people together to do one thing at the same time
8484279 i normally run by myself to get away from everything
8484280 it relieves stress but its a nice change to be out there with so many people to share stories and to run with a purpose
8484281 well get together with friends and family and get a world outlook on things
8484282 to have people all over the world running at the same time together
8484283 i work at the community stage area with another lady and we facilitate all the groups that perform there

8484285 theres a watermelon seed spitting contest at 1 p m saturday a root beer chugging contest at 1 p m sunday and the ice cream eating contest is 1 p m monday
8484286 im hoping for good weather but just seeing all the performers we have every year come back to the stage you wouldnt believe how much like family it is when its such a big festival but it is
8484287 how many not for profit organizations make the majority of their funds at the festival whether it be the optimists clubs selling their hotdogs or churches selling corndogs on a stick all those places make the majority of their funds for sending kids to camp or whatever it may be from our festival
8484288 we have a dj who plays music and there are disco lights and we play games such as limbo and racing games like green light go
8484289 parents can feel comfortable leaving their children here so you can either come with your family or drop your kids off and go off and go do something else
8484290 its kind of like revenge of the nerds but were not really nerds
8484291 we just dont really care that much my character is pregnant so i really dont feel like doing anything
8484292 im not going to say this business is easy because its not but im definitely grateful that im a part of it if thats because of idol then thats because of idol im not afraid to look back to where i got my start
8484293 guys of my generation after watching army of darkness or the evil dead movies bruce becomes a type of superhero to you
8484294 if im free ill jump at the opportunity to do it
8484295 i love working with my stargate family it was my first big job and its been going on for a dozen years now and it still goes on
8484296 i have to teach people what i know worked for me im responsible but what they poured into me how they blessed my life the older generation now that im a part of the older generation its my responsibility to pour into the generation thats come after me
8484297 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value
8484298 they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for im fired up about firing up young people to understand their power and their worth
8484299 i just about died when i went in the store
8484300 i dont know how traffics been but from an aesthetic perspective i think it looks great for me to be taken aback is kind of a big thing
8484301 where each catholic senator was suppose to be evaluated against catholic doctrine and usccb
8484302 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
8484303 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
8484304 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
8484305 kalau boleh saya tak mahu menceritakan tentang majlis perkahwinan itu dengan mendalam bukannya apa ia adalah satu memori yang indah dan sangat bermakna buat kami ini hal peribadi lagipun perkahwinan kami sangat sederhana kami bernikah di sebelah petang dan bersanding pada waktu malamnya yang penting inilah impian saya iaitu berkahwin di tepian pantai tetamu yang hadir pula kebanyakannya merupakan saudara terdekat dan juga kawan rapat saya yang dikenali sejak sekolah sahaja

8484308 in cases where it looks like an officer needs training they direct that it happens in a timely manner
8484309 weve done a major initiative on compliance with seat belts and we attribute that decline to that directive

8484313 organizing scheming or acting to subvert the political power of the state and overthrow the socialist system
8484314 incitement to subvert the political power of the state and overthrow the socialist system by spreading rumors slander or other means
8484315 rudolf carnaps principle of tolerance is an early formulation of the idea of logical pluralism in logic there are no morals everyone is at liberty to build his own logic i e his own form of language as he wishes but is the logical validity of an argument just a matter of language choice and if so is this really a pluralism about logical pluralism also insists that there is more than one correct logic classical intuitionist and relevent logic as well as a number of other logics all correctly govern our reasoning within a given language but apply to different cases can we make sense of genuinely different but equally good logical consequence relations
8484316 the cost is about dealing with loss and the processes one might use to help get things back to a better balance in life
8484317 loss can cover a lot of ground but the cost is focused on two areas in particular love and freedom how each are tied together and how each must maintain their autonomy in order to flourish

8484323 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8484324 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8484325 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8484326 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8484327 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8484328 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8484329 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8484330 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8484331 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8484332 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8484333 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8484334 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8484335 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8484336 this is an operation that hasnt been done before it took a real team effort
8484337 we also took a skin graft from his thigh area to help fill in the large indentation of his lower lip to rebuild the area
8484338 its really the work of the doctors in ireland that have helped alan come this far they were essential in his early life saving resuscitation and permanently maintaining his breathing and feeding tubes throughout the years
8484339 we suspect based on what we were able to see that the tongue is so undeveloped its unlikely at this point that we will be able to restore swallowing and breathing
8484340 his mom bernie has been so supportive throughout this entire process
8484341 she had the biggest smile on her face when the surgery was completed
8484342 his tenacity is what really propelled him to have the operation
8484343 initially i think there was some concern on part of his parents but it was alans motivation that gave him the support to get him through these procedures
8484344 its a great success not only physically but a new chance for his self esteem and self confidence
8484345 this capability is a crucial first step in defining translational therapies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease in humans
8484346 although still a long way from the clinic the work shows that gene therapy is a potential treatment to combat some forms of congenital deafness
8484347 with one in 2 000 children born deaf because of genetic defects such a therapy would clearly be of value
8484348 si vingt cinq ans tu nes pas mari e tu auras de bonnes raisons davoir honte

8484353 todo el equipo dedica este logro a palermo por ser el jugador y la persona que es
8484354 boca tiene jugadores que son muy unidos y mart n es un pilar de este grupo
8484355 es muy importante para boca juniors ganar otro t tulo
8484356 es muy importante para el club ganar otro t tulo
8484357 es importante para boca y para nosotros los jugadores boca est siempre en la b squeda de t tulos y para mi es una satisfacci n muy grande porque he ganado varios con este equipo
8484358 le dedicamos el t tulo a mart n palermo que est pasado un momento dif cil y le decimos que esperamos que regrese al equipo cuanto antes
8484359 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8484360 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8484361 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8484362 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8484363 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8484364 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness
8484365 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8484366 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8484367 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8484368 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8484369 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8484370 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8484371 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8484372 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8484373 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8484374 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8484375 her face swelled like a balloon liquids and pus seeped from her skin and she was given several rounds of antibiotics
8484376 sores and lesions opened up throughout her body and she became so gravely ill that even her family found their visits to her bedside to be horrific
8484377 the two doctors diagnosed her condition as listeria and she got antibiotics for the listeria
8484378 ive gone to see a doctor he says listeria is highly unlikely but were going to try to rule it out
8484379 its the not knowing thats the unbelievable part here for everybody including myself
8484380 this has touched almost everybody somehow im not a happy camper about this at all
8484381 i feel sad that i dont know what happened to her i am sure her family would love to have some closure so would i
8484382 the bridgewater loan is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world
8484383 the present initiative is intended to secure the long term future of the loan for the public benefit
8484384 we are delighted to be working in close collaboration with the duke and our colleagues in london in order to achieve this
8484385 have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8484386 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8484387 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8484388 saying i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8484389 why did the lord allow us to be defeated by the philistines
8484390 lets bring the ark of the covenant of the lord from shiloh if we carry it into battle with us it will save us from our enemies
8484391 why did the lord allow us to be defeated by the philistines
8484392 why did the lord allow me to get injured in an accident
8484393 why did the lord allow me to fail in the examination
8484394 this is a disaster we have never had to face anything like this before 8 help who can save us from these mighty gods of israel they are the same gods who destroyed the egyptians with plagues when israel was in the wilderness 9 fight as never before philistines if you dont we will become the hebrews slaves just as they have been ours stand up like men and fight
8484395 change in america doesnt start from the top up top down it starts from the bottom up
8484396 arnelle had a fight with christie over christies behavior thats what started the whole thing christie has some problems with drinking and arnelle got mad o j said dont talk to her like that and arnelle pushed him
8484397 cut on the back of his head blood was coming out the side of his mouth and his lip was cut
8484398 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be open
8484399 enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in by it because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life and there are few who find it
8484400 since ive never been called a man of few words let me say this simply as i can yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama the next president of the united states
8484401 he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept the situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8484402 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8484403 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8484404 these times require more than a good soldier they need a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8484405 in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he obama hit it out of the park
8484406 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8484407 this time of year we buy general things like school supplies underwear pants
8484408 i figured silver hair and love to shop equaled silver shoppers
8484409 back to school and christmas are our favorite times but we buy all year round if there is a need
8484410 each member decides how much she can spend a month and regulates her expenditure accordingly
8484411 the school nurses are the ones who come in contact with these kids
8484412 some dont have clean clothes some need haircuts some even come in hungry
8484413 my father loved life and lived it to the fullest
8484414 he wasnt afraid to surf anywhere you wanted to go he was such a positive guy
8484415 even when he was having all his hip problems and back problems when a lot of guys wouldve felt sorry for themselves he was just always hey ill be back no matter how bad it was he would always see the good in it
8484416 everybody just loved being around him i thought rooms lit up whenever he came in people were so happy to see him when he got there
8484417 he was a guy who was really respected obviously look at all the people who are here
8484418 i really learned in the last week and a half how important his friends were to him
8484419 a woman will forgive infidelity but she wont forgive poverty
8484420 my dad always said even if theyre with someone girls are always looking for their next boyfriend
8484421 thats why you make sure not to be nice to them
8484422 the grad school tuition grants san antonio grants for intervention and rehabilitation of girls mine and kissed grants for homeschool state grants california taking her preserve america grants nonprofit grants awarded in 2006 funding
8484423 my plan would provide three times more tax relief to the middle class
8484424 i am so confused joe arent you racing this weekend is this what you do in the taper a 23 mile run 5 days out is that what you do for an ironman that is just cawazy
8484425 are you trying out something and not telling us about it a little non taper im
8484426 ok cant stand it any more did you really do a 23 miler 4 days before your ironman is this some new brett sutton torture test
8484427 the state of texas water code is being violated the work that has already begun has altered drainage flow quantities and velocity of storm water to my property and my neighbors
8484428 i expect that either the city or the county is responsible to make sure appropriate engineered drainage plans are submitted and approved
8484429 it doesnt look like there is any planning that has been done for the runoff
8484430 i dont know how many acres will be paved over or roofed over
8484431 right now it just trickles into the ground and there is a great potential that the water will now runoff into our subdivision and possibly flood homes
8484432 we dont have any general regulatory land use authority out in the county
8484433 it seems that at this point the enforcement authority lies with the state agencies specifically the tceq texas commission on environmental property
8484434 if there is not a subdivision plat in the etj then we dont have any authority and i dont think the city does either
8484435 our subdivision regulations apply to the etj but the issue here is that the property owner does not need to plat so we cannot regulate it
8484436 we have very limited authority outside of the city limits if someone does not need to plat then we cant do much
8484437 it looks like tceq will take care of the immediate concerns we have
8484438 the way it is being constructed there is actually less drainage onto the homestead and the woods than there was before
8484439 i think for the safety health and welfare of the citizens the city and the county need to have one person saying this is what you have to do
8484440 you want to make sure that whatever is being done is something that everyone can live with
8484441 i would certainly think about that decision and anything that would help the european cause i would be for
8484442 i would help in any way shape or form potentially yes
8484443 being the only european thats won five ryder cups im very honoured to be that person
8484444 id be watching and hoping the team make it four wins in a row which would be exceptional
8484445 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8484446 qu es lo que puede hacerse con el ind gena
8484447 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8484448 while the tape shows part of the story what it cannot show is officer simoes intent
8484449 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8484450 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today

8484462 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
8484463 this competition is leading the direction of the worlds dance trend
8484464 people nowadays use arts as a way to pour out emotions while people of the past used arts as a way to worship and honor the gods
8484465 one big difference between this and last years competition is that the contestants improved dramatically overall
8484466 their dance fundamentals have improved a lot from which they can manifest the inner meanings of classic chinese dance even better
8484467 it is in fact inherited from ancient history we have been constantly explicating our understanding on classic chinese dance and as to whether it is the same as chinese opera or martial arts everyone seems to have distinct concepts so it is our mission to show the true and pure classic chinese dance to the world
8484468 we are happy to see that the contesters are trying to convey the inner feeling of the characters and not using the dance vocabulary randomly
8484469 it allows the audiences to have a more vivid image of classic chinese dance it is different from modern dance and ballet for their concepts forms and inner connotations are all different

8484485 se ha realizado un gran trabajo previo al inicio de la temporada y por eso pensamos que nuestro objetivo es estar en la final sabemos que es una temporada larga y dif cil por eso debemos ir paso a paso y el primero de ellos es vencer a frailes el pr ximo 6 de septiembre
8484486 creo que somos muy afortunados hemos logrado conformar un gran grupo de coacheo y esperamos reflejar todos nuestros conocimientos en los jugadores para tener la campa a que esperamos
8484487 este cambio ser ben fico para el futbol americano de nuestro pa s ste es el primer paso de lo que vendr en el futuro ya que existen proyectos y propuestas para llevar esta liga a niveles m s altos
8484488 yo no entiendo por qu el presidente de onefa hace comentarios negativos sobre la liga por eso es necesario que en un futuro exista una especie de comisionado que tome las decisiones para beneficio y no para perjuicio del futbol americano de nuestro pa s
8484489 we will eventually need to build a new jail there is no doubt about that as the countys population increases
8484490 i think we need to look at how to be more efficient right now however to avoid spending millions of taxpayer dollars before we need to
8484491 the second alternative is to figure out a way to get those prisoners who are incarcerated some kind of disposition
8484492 my job is to provide the tools to the court system to do just that
8484493 the state only gives so much to the region for visiting judges they will use that money to hire judges to come in here and sit and bring some resolve to some of these prisoners
8484494 then when that state money runs out the county has put a large sum of money in the budget to finish the job
8484495 in the 198th weve already started taking some action this last month where weve done a special day to deal with motions to revoke
8484496 everyone has to be on the same page judges prosecutors and defense attorneys all need to be available
8484497 as long as everyone understands that my district has five counties and we have to do each one of them due diligence i think we can work something out
8484498 commissioner baldwin is absolutely right in setting this up and getting everybody talking
8484499 we have been working to get some things done but we have not had a discussion as a whole with everyone involved i think its a good thing to do
8484500 it just makes sense to me to figure out a way to comply with the state law as far as housing the number of prisoners without spending a lot of money
8484501 if this program doesnt work i dont know what we will do other than spend 10 million to 15 million on a new jail
8484502 these guys are all just super guys and this is to my knowledge the first time that we will all be in the same room
8484503 there can be a resolution there is no question of that in my mind
8484504 its a good starting point it has to be done we have to look at all the aspects
8484505 but one meeting is not going to solve it theres just so many different variables that go into it it isnt just about the judges
8484506 i cant control when dps kerrville pd or ingram get their reports back which can delay the court process

8484525 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8484526 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaida
8484527 a successful war against iraq would require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8484528 i support barack obama because of my beautiful granddaughter as i sit and watch in awe of her growth her intelligence and her innocence i think about the current state of our nations public education
8484529 lets get you taken care of first and well talk about your buddies later
8484530 if you always do what you did youll always get what you got
8484531 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8484532 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8484533 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8484534 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8484535 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8484536 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8484537 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8484538 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8484539 how many events do you think i should be working
8484540 well you know we had a long primary season which means that a lot of stuff was backed up
8484541 which means that ive got to still do work preparing for thursday night
8484542 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago
8484543 theyre more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families
8484544 the better off this campaign is going to be because i think i can make the case im the right choice for them thats what i want to spend my time doing
8484545 i was surprised given the convention but i think its great hes here
8484546 seems to know what were thinking what we need hes not one of those multimillionaire guys
8484547 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8484548 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8484549 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8484550 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8484551 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8484552 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8484553 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8484554 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8484555 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling

8484565 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8484566 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8484567 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8484568 well sir its obvious that this just isnt a priority for you unfortunately for you it is for me be prepared for my notice of resignation
8484569 well uh ill give you an answer by the end of the week
8484570 i noticed you like sisterhood of the traveling pants i like those books as well i just saw the second movie
8484571 yeah my mom says theyre good for me at this adolescent stage of my development
8484572 i then said to him i dont care about god bless america i just need to use the bathroom as soon as i said that he immediately pinned my arm behind my back
8484573 he shoved me out the front gate and told me get out of their country if i didnt like it
8484574 because they are enforcing a rule of that imposes political correctness through refusing to let somebody go to bathroom while a patriotic song is playing that violates constitutional rights
8484575 the officers observed a male standing on his seat cursing using inappropriate language and acting in a disorderly manner while reeking of alcohol and decided to eject him rather than subject others to his offensive behavior
8484576 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8484577 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8484578 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8484579 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8484580 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8484581 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8484582 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8484583 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8484584 again and again on the most important of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8484585 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8484586 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8484587 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8484588 be there because will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8484589 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is
8484590 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8484591 it was a true pleasure to work with you i loved the patience and time that was taken to help me understand the process and no question were too small or too many i loved the finish product and am so happy with it it looks so professional and beautiful it is more then i thought i would get worth every penny
8484592 heather is very responsive intuitive supportive and patient with all my questions and has now transformed my blog which i absolutely love i think that what stands out most of all to me about heather is her integrity she follows the guidelines set out by stampin up regarding the release of information and i admire that quality about her
8484593 heather has started a new business creating and maintaining blogs for busy computer illiterate people like me i was thrilled to win one of her grand opening prizes but didnt really know what to tell her i wanted done not to fear heather made it easy and fun
8484594 who do you think you are on tg4 at 10 30 is a repeat of bills episode

8484597 congratulations to mr scott on taking on the leadership of the liberal democrats with such a small membership and so little support for the liberal democrats tavish scott faces an uphill task with polls showing few people know who he is the libdems have voted for more of the same in an invisible election for an invisible man tavish scott is responsible for their dire election results and their catastrophic decision to reject a coalition

8484603 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8484604 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8484605 we wish we could help we wish we could be with her
8484606 we take allegations of excessive force very seriously and will investigate fully
8484607 as soon as we know the facts well provide more information
8484608 just shown in that context you dont get what the whole dynamics or the full situation is
8484609 i dont know if theres anything thats before or after that sort of thing
8484610 obviously looking at that id want to look at the use of force report
8484611 my job is to maintain objectivity until the completion of an investigation what i can say is i think that that warrants additional review but i have to maintain objectivity on anything because you cant rush to judgment
8484612 its really frustrating that we have this incident of violence now
8484613 theres been hundreds of contacts with officers that have gone very well
8484614 we may have an isolated instance here and there and the department is committed to fully looking into those instances and if its deemed inappropriate well take the appropriate actions
8484615 its very very important that the disability community be inclusive with the general population
8484616 they need to learn who we are and we need to do outreach to them and tell them that we want to work
8484617 i guess from the day that i was injured i started working and advocating because i was advocating for myself
8484618 but as i went to rehabs and hospitals i saw people that didnt have the skill level that didnt have the family support that i had that were not being able to access services
8484619 when hitler finally appeared on the balcony for a moment they reminded me of the crazed expressions i once saw in the back country of louisiana on the faces of some holy rollers they looked up at him as if he were a messiah their faces transformed into something positively inhuman
8484620 some of the reasons for hitlers astounding success borrowing a chapter from the roman catholic church he is restoring pageantry and color and mysticism to the drab lives of 20th century germans this mornings opening meeting was more than a gorgeous show it also had something of the mysticism and religious fervor of an easter or christmas mass in a great gothic cathedral the hall was a sea of brightly colored flags even hitlers arrival was made dramatic the band stopped playing there was a hush over the thirty thousand people packed in the hall then the band struck up the badenweiler march hitler appeared in the back of the auditorium and followed by his aides g ring goebbels hess himmler and the others he slowly strode down the long center aisle while thirty thousand hands were raised in salute
8484621 every word dropped by hitler seemed like an inspired word from on high mans or at least the germans critical faculty is swept away at such moments and every lie pronounced is accepted as high truth itself
8484622 the german form of life is definitely determined for the next thousand years
8484623 a few months ago a black shadow spread over the movement neither the sa nor any other institution of the party has anything to do with this shadow they are all deceived who believe that even one crack has occurred in the structure of our united movement only a lunatic or deliberate liar could think that i or anybody would ever intend to dissolve what we ourselves have built up over many long years in the past you have proved your loyalty to me a thousandfold and it cannot and will not be different in the future

8484631 eso va m s all de la voluntad de alg n entrenador es un tema reglamentario porque existen plazos para designar los estadios si se hace en el plazo establecido por la fifa no hay ninguna voluntad de entrenador que lo pueda cuestionar

8484636 we are your brothers and we are committed to non violence
8484637 the democratic party portrays itself as the anti war party but that is not the case
8484638 its a party that has not done anything to stop the war and is as compliant in the way this country is being run
8484639 we will be meeting with the obama campaigns veterans liaison who will figure out how we can read our letter to senator obama and the delegates
8484640 this is a wonderful example of how diplomacy can work
8484641 were coming into a time when conventional warfare simply is not something thats going to keep my nation safe iraq is a prime example anyone with half a brain knows that were less safe now
8484642 im sure senator obama would like to hear what we have to say
8484643 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8484644 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8484645 its a lot of citizen journalism which means everyone participates
8484646 weve gotten to the point where weve opened up the mainstream media to anybody
8484647 it doesnt matter where theyre from or the size of the blog they can be part of a news feed that goes out to the entire country
8484648 i think journalists are much more on their toes these days nowadays if you want to find more information on a candidates tax proposal you can find that information from hundreds of resources through google rather than just a few mainstream providers
8484649 when you open up journalism to the marketplace it fosters new innovation not four years down the road but in just a few months were paving the way in denver and the same is true for next week more access is the right direction
8484650 sure wed love to but only if you support single sign on with google apps
8484651 shes a funny girl to watch its not like i dont like her but if you know it before its okay i guess its just the way she is she takes a long time between balls when i am going to serve but when she serves its really fast
8484652 i was so exhausted at that moment i was breathing hard and i didnt have the energy to get up
8484653 i always know with her shes always complaining about something then shes running so good any way so i knew she would start to complain when shes down
8484654 i mean she was running a lot so she must have been tired
8484655 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8484656 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8484657 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8484658 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8484659 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8484660 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8484661 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people

8484663 para ajusticiar al alcalde del pueblo sanagor n santos ruiz sindicado por un testigo como autor del asesinato de mashi yupanqui un top grafo muy querido en sanagor n
8484664 a cuyo cad ver le faltaba parte del t rax
8484665 the next six months are going to tell the story
8484666 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8484667 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8484668 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8484669 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8484670 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8484671 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8484672 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8484673 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8484674 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8484675 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8484676 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8484677 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8484678 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8484679 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8484680 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8484681 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8484682 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8484683 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8484684 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8484685 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8484686 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8484687 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8484688 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8484689 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8484690 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8484691 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8484692 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8484693 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8484694 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8484695 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8484696 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8484697 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8484698 we hire smart people who are passionate about their love of politics and love of news

8484700 this has been something the city has wanted for many years
8484701 it gives the people another access point to the river that will draw a lot more people into that part of downtown
8484702 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8484703 i sure did hes one a the best presidents we ever had
8484704 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq
8484705 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8484706 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first
8484707 when john mccain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after 9 11 and proclaimed
8484708 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
8484709 ive said it before they may be the best team since urbans meyer team went to the bcs
8484710 they have a very athletic quarterback who runs the spread that weve had problems against in the past they have explosive players and they have some of the fastest corners well play against
8484711 any opener has an element of unknown regardless of circumstances
8484712 it is always a best guess scenario it is positive for us both offensively and defensively there are similarities to us in schematics
8484713 we have to go into the game with a broad based game plan
8484714 two to three series in you get a good idea of your game plan football is a game of adjustments we will make them based on what we are seeing
8484715 we have to go play well and play our best football
8484716 whether adoption of ifrs is in the public interest and would benefit investors
8484717 the sec estimates that 110 companies would be eligible to use ifrs at the end of fiscal years ending after dec 15 2009 depending on their size and industry
8484718 we believe the capital markets ultimately will insist on ifrs for public companies
8484719 this action by the sec continues a robust and thoughtful debate that is critical as the transition occurs
8484720 time is cruel to everything but it seems to have singled out eyeglasses for special punishment
8484721 look how sad and beautiful we all are in our randomness
8484722 people just wanted to stick with the status quo there was no desire to innovate
8484723 the difference is that we love what were doing weve acquired a great team with really good chemistry
8484724 radio is so commercialized they play it because they have to not because they want to radio has lost its edge
8484725 these reports are being investigated in afghanistan and well look for the results of that investigation
8484726 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
8484727 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
8484728 we continue at this point to believe that this was a legitimate strike against the taliban
8484729 we call it the jihad of game controllers you get kids that are in their low 20s that are gamers and they go right to the game paddle and they dont know why us old timers like using the f 16 hands on throttle and stick controllers
8484730 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8484731 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8484732 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse
8484733 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8484734 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8484735 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8484736 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8484737 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8484738 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8484739 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8484740 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8484741 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8484742 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8484743 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8484744 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8484745 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8484746 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8484747 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8484748 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8484749 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8484750 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8484751 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8484752 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8484753 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8484754 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8484755 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8484756 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8484757 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8484758 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8484759 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8484760 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8484761 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8484762 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8484763 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8484764 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8484765 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8484766 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8484767 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8484768 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8484769 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8484770 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8484771 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8484772 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8484773 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8484774 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8484775 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8484776 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8484777 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8484778 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8484779 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8484780 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8484781 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8484782 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8484783 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8484784 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8484785 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8484786 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8484787 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8484788 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8484789 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8484790 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8484791 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8484792 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8484793 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8484794 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8484795 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8484796 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8484797 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8484798 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8484799 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8484800 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8484801 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8484802 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8484803 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8484804 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8484805 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8484806 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8484807 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8484808 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8484809 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8484810 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8484811 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8484812 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8484813 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8484814 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8484815 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8484816 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8484817 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8484818 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8484819 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8484820 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8484821 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8484822 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8484823 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8484824 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8484825 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8484826 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8484827 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8484828 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8484829 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8484830 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8484831 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8484832 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8484833 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8484834 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8484835 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt
8484836 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare sen mccain to candidate mccain candidate mccain now supports the very wartime tax cuts that sen mccain once called irresponsible candidate mccain criticizes sen mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would vote against the immigration bill that sen mccain wrote are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before youre against it
8484837 just think john mccain voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8484838 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8484839 it integration and soa are not getting enough board level attention
8484840 we want to establish a dialogue between neuroscience and cognitive art
8484841 why is it that humour will engage attention to such a powerful degree that you cant do anything else at the same time
8484842 weve fallen into this false sense of urgency that they create
8484843 that idea that everything is breaking news and that if youre not watching us youre going to miss this thing
8484844 but nothing theyre saying is of any import because nobody filters it
8484845 nobody wanted to have a beer with him he would have been a terrible president hes an elitist can he bowl somebody could have bowled him i just find it stunning as to where this election is going to be decided or where we allow it to be decided
8484846 blog readers should remember that reading and commenting on a blog is a privilege that can be revoked at any time
8484847 the press still own us an approach that will help to overthrow prejudices against indigenous peoples and question the idea that the amazon can survive to the extensive livestock and agriculture
8484848 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
8484849 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
8484850 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8484851 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8484852 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
8484853 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
8484854 direct action buys you time indirect action wins the war against insurgents and terrorists in a given location
8484855 how can the country of the declaration of independence madison avenue and hollywood be losing the war of ideas to people who think its rational to cut other peoples heads off
8484856 do you consider the killing of women and children to be jihad
8484857 known to those in the underground mainly as dr fadl
8484858 one of the first members of al qaedas top council twenty years ago he wrote two of the most important books in modern islamist discourse al qaeda used them to indoctrinate recruits and justify killing now fadl was announcing a new book rejecting al qaedas violence we are prohibited from committing aggression even if the enemies of islam do that fadl wrote in his fax which was sent from tora prison in egypt
8484859 the contrast in types of action throws the opponents off balance politically causing their repression to rebound against their position and weaken their power
8484860 i have seen a great impact on the young youth because they are carrying themselves in a different way
8484861 i never thought it would happen but it did and it is going to happen
8484862 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8484873 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8484874 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8484875 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8484876 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8484877 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8484878 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8484879 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8484880 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8484881 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8484882 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8484883 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8484884 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8484885 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8484886 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8484887 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8484888 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8484889 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8484890 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8484891 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8484892 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8484893 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8484894 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8484895 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8484896 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8484897 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8484898 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8484899 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8484900 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8484901 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8484902 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8484903 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8484904 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8484905 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8484906 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8484907 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8484908 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8484909 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8484910 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8484911 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8484912 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8484913 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8484914 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8484915 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8484916 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8484917 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming

8484921 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8484922 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8484923 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8484924 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8484925 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8484926 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8484927 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8484928 hemos detectado que un 9 1 de ellos no ha pagado la tarifa por lo tanto se ha convidado a pagar la tarifa o descender del bus lo que se ha dado de una forma muy normal y de colaboraci n
8484929 cada vez que los inspectores suben al bus hay mucha gente que se baja del bus antes de que se realice el control entonces nosotros estimamos que estas son personas que pueden estar evadiendo y que pueden bajar del bus para evitar ser fiscalizados
8484930 lo que nosotros hemos constatado en la ma ana es que hay una actitud de mucha colaboraci n de parte de los usuarios hemos visto que les interesa pagar la tarifa les interesa que el tema funcione le interesa que el control se haga
8484931 estamos 100 seguros que las m quinas funcionan y en caso de que se detecte alguna anomal a va a ser subsanado el problema

8484936 they had lots of guns including a revolver and an ak 47
8484937 most of the shots hit the bonnet which caused the engine to break down
8484938 the robbers then ran to his car and one of them used his pistol to
8484939 in the meantime other cars came driving towards them and the robbers fled
8484940 they kept on telling us to be quiet but i got such a fright

8484964 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8484965 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8484966 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8484967 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8484968 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8484969 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8484970 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8484971 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running

8484978 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8484979 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8484980 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8484981 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8484982 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8484983 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8484984 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8484989 although there is a risk of vitamin d deficiency it is always far better to exclusively breastfeed babies through six months and partial breastfeed through at least a year and deal potential vitamin d deficiency through regular exposure to the sun a balanced diet on the part of the mother and supplementation either of mother or infant depending on situation than to not breastfeed due to potential vitamin d deficiency
8484990 i thought i was doing the best thing for her
8484991 i completely support breast feeding and i think breast milk is the perfect food and the healthiest way to nourish an infant however were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up they may start their lives vitamin d deficient and then all theyre getting is vitamin d deficient breast milk
8484992 new york times watch exclusive breastfeeding may not be best for your baby ugg
8484993 if three years ago someone had said to me on the streets of new york that somebody named barack obama would be our nominee i would have said they were crazy

8485005 it is a milestone that we witnessed here tonight in our countrys ability sometimes to just say you know the past is the past
8485006 look how hard he had to fight just to win the nomination
8485007 its not just democrats that are going to vote in this election i want to think he can win but i live in the real world

8485015 to provide relief from ocular discomfort during contact lens wear in adverse environmental conditions
8485016 the measurement of stray light can be a discriminative test to assessing patients glare complaints
8485017 off flap epi lasik offers comparable postoperative pain a lower level of haze formation a rapider visual recovery and better visual quality
8485018 in conclusion aliphatic beta nitro alcohols can cross link scleral tissue at physiologic ph and temperature
8485019 the wf amp vp group had greater reduction in corneal astigmatism
8485020 while lasers have been effective in eye surgeries for decades they were not used for corneal transplants until the femtosecond laser was shown to be a superior cutting tool to the trephine
8485021 both zernike and fourier algorithms performed best when reconstructing simulated wavefronts from normal eyes and worst with pkp eyes
8485022 liposomes that are surface bound to a biomaterial such as a contact lens are of interest for localized delivery of therapeutic agents
8485023 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
8485024 the primary endpoint is the reduction in iop at day 28 compared to baseline
8485025 the systemic noel was 30 ppm bpa approximately 5 mg kg day the reproductive developmental noel was 300 ppm approximately 50 mg kg day therefore bpa is not considered a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant in mice
8485026 there are few reports concerning mrsa in the united arab emirates uae
8485027 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8485028 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8485029 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8485030 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8485031 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8485032 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina

8485034 special gel and ultrasound sound waves in a handheld device to send drugs through the outer layers of the eye and into the damaged retina at the back of the eye
8485035 eating tryptophan rich foods like poultry chicken soup and chocolate can boost serotonin levels
8485036 the therapeutic ophthalmology market in which we participate is also less influenced by recessionary pressures than those medical markets which are based upon primarily elective or private pay procedures
8485037 in germany approximately one million photocoagulations are performed on the retina every year
8485038 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
8485039 the presence of mmps in post lasik corneas correlates with an ongoing wound healing process
8485040 eye drops have difficulty in efficiently delivering drugs to the back of the eye and ordinary injections are invasive as the needle penetrates across eye tissues
8485041 edaravone can protect the retina from i r injury in rats through reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis of retinal neurons
8485042 accurate determination of cdr is important in tele screening for vision threatening diseases and can aid in identifying subjects with suspicious onh in need of specialty eye care
8485043 improperly applied makeup is a risk to the eye if you have eye surgery do not wear makeup around the eye until your ophthalmologist tells you it is safe to do so and then only use fresh new makeup

8485045 age onset of cataract is the distinguishing characteristic about 14 of blind children are affected half of the adult population worldwide aged 60 and older suffers from age related cataract
8485046 visual disability in this population was common highly correctable and frequently un corrected
8485047 no cause and effect relationship could be proven between rd development and lasik procedure in myopia
8485048 address an unmet need providing evaluation and possible treatment of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy regardless of the ability to pay
8485049 a focused dose of radiation will be delivered directly to the area of the eye affected by wet amd minimising damage to healthy adjoining tissue
8485050 phacoemulsification with foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is beneficial for pacg with cataract
8485051 in symptomatic wearers of disposable soft contact lenses the total hoas the fi and the si with the lens with pvp were significantly lower than with the conventional lens
8485052 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8485053 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8485054 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8485055 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina

8485059 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8485060 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8485061 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us

8485072 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8485073 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it

8485099 where would you like to have the next company party
8485100 all i can think about is this game at this point
8485101 well see what happens today but the bottom line is they sucked
8485102 even without having our two best pitchers so forth and so on they still stunk thats the bottom line
8485103 you dont want to think about that until youre counted out by the numbers were still going to go out there play hard and see what happens
8485104 everybody has that month where were as good as alex rodriguez is
8485105 ive had those months before where i was pretty darn good and i know a bunch of these other guys have all of us just need to be really good
8485106 double vision part 2 which covered the colecovision part 1 covered the intellivision
8485107 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8485108 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8485109 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8485110 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8485111 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8485112 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8485113 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8485114 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8485115 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8485116 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8485117 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8485118 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8485119 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8485120 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8485121 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8485122 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8485123 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8485124 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8485125 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8485126 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8485127 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8485128 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8485129 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8485130 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8485131 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8485132 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8485133 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8485134 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8485135 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8485136 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8485137 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8485138 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8485139 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8485140 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8485141 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8485142 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8485143 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8485144 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8485145 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8485146 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8485147 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

8485155 measles is back and its because your kids arent vaccinated
8485156 vaccination rate that has fallen to 85 percent already one child has died
8485157 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which was change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up
8485158 geological maps are essential tools in finding natural resources e g water hydrocarbons and minerals and when planning to mitigate geohazards e g earthquakes volcanoes and radon natural resources are a crucial source of wealth for all nations especially those that need to develop and build their economies identifying geohazards is often a matter of life or death other challenges facing all nations in the 21st century include rising sea levels management of waste nuclear or domestic and storage of carbon knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial
8485159 today you can go to the onegeology website and get geological maps from across the globe from an overview of our entire planet to larger scale maps of the rocks of individual nations you also have the ability to hop from this web site to higher resolution applied maps and data on linked national web sites participating nations are contributing to a legacy for humankind by acting locally they are thinking globally
8485160 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8485161 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8485162 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8485163 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8485164 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8485165 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8485166 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8485167 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8485168 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8485169 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8485170 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8485171 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8485172 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8485173 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8485174 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8485175 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8485176 u s lawyers are free to outsource legal work including to lawyers or nonlawyers outside the country if they adhere to ethics rules requiring competence supervision protection of confidential information reasonable fees and not assisting unauthorized practice of law
8485177 if we didnt include pro life democrats in the big tent of the party we democrats would be in the minority
8485178 a strong and unequivocal support for roe v wade and that portion was strengthened
8485179 thats very encouraging and its a step in the right direction
8485180 im excited that democrats at this convention for the first time are listening to those of us who believe that we have to champion the unborn child
8485181 the fact that the party is actively supporting and recruiting pro life democrats is also a big step in the right direction
8485182 if obama is elected president i want him to make sure he realizes that he is the president of the united states and that people have very different views on the abortion issue and before he overturns things when it comes to that issue to really think about it
8485183 really represent the whole party and not just naral and planned parenthood

8485194 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog
8485195 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on

8485204 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8485205 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8485206 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8485207 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8485208 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player

8485215 i dont know if you can compare it because we havent played any real games
8485216 i think the comparisons come when you play the regular season games its too hard to tell in preseason how to compare a team but i know this team is going to be a good team thats something i definitely know
8485217 having a lot of guys returning that played last year plus adding wide receiver bernard berrian as the deep threat weve got a lot of good guys that are going to definitely contribute to this being a good season
8485218 having that veteran experience is always a plus with madieu but tyrell has been playing like a veteran
8485219 hes getting out there and being in the starting lineup and we expect him to play as though he is a starter and when madieu comes back its going to be an extra plus to have another guy that can be a starter too
8485220 im like a fine wine a cabernet merlot shiraz blend
8485221 it can do a lot of things its gets better as you open it up and let it get out there and air out filtrate do all those things i dont even need a decanter just let me go out there and run pour me in your mouth suck it up and enjoy the run
8485222 be a big tv commentator or do what youre doing come on man and have to ask guys like myself questions like that im not ready for that yet
8485223 im the no 2 guy behind heath miller but still playing a lot yeah were doing two tight end formations every time im out there i just make the most of it and keep them wanting to use two tight ends whenever they can

8485227 we depend on the community to help us in this important effort each fall we hope that when families begin their back to school shopping they pick up a few extra things that we can share with the vulnerable children we serve
8485228 we were not happy about being asked to hold our meeting away from the main venue but we recognize that the treatment we received this year from the organizers and the pif secretariat office was a significant improvement over previous years

8485250 as long as detroit was making money it was easy for us to accept union demands and recoup them later in the form of price increases
8485251 without it nothing may seem worth doing or if some things have value for us we will lack the will to strive for them all desire and activity becomes empty and vain and we sink into apathy and cynicism
8485252 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8485253 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8485254 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8485255 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8485256 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8485257 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8485258 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8485259 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8485260 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8485261 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that

8485269 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8485270 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8485271 none of this would have been possible without del and phyllis nieto said from the billy de frank center in san jose a gay and lesbian social center
8485272 every time i run into a rough patch i keep telling myself im doing this for phyllis and del
8485273 lesbian woman a book written in 1972 by martin and lyon
8485274 it was a profound impact on me to be in college and that book told me i wasnt the only one we werent the only ones that you could be lesbian and enjoy life be yourself and have basic rights
8485275 they graciously agreed and invited us into their home nieto said
8485276 now its not going to happen this is hitting me really hard
8485277 how they put all of us in that little house was a miracle brock said with a laugh
8485278 there was a lot of planning going on about strategy but there was a lot of friendliness too the group started mostly as a social one then it evolved into more of an activist group
8485279 he was a hippie and out in the open nieto said
8485280 if thats all there is published in 1970 she tore into the sexism she believed relegated lesbians to lower standing and power in the fledgling gay rights movement
8485281 the police were actively finding ways to harass the community there was no hugging no holding hands in public nothing at work that said you were gay or lesbian martin had a profound impact for all of us
8485282 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8485283 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8485284 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8485285 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8485286 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8485287 more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8485288 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8485289 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8485290 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8485291 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8485292 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8485293 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8485294 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son please respect his familys grief and privacy at this time
8485295 as a quarterback you cant worry about everything else thats going on around you
8485296 all you need to do is go out and play for your teammates and show its a whole different guy out there and i want to go out and win ballgames with you i can praise him a whole lot ill say hes a man hes brave definitely
8485297 were going to keep playing let the game come to us
8485298 if it happens it happens if it doesnt were not going to go to try to force it we want to stay in our game plan
8485299 the more you play the more opportunities there are for big plays
8485300 he just hasnt had the reps i think people would have liked to see this offseason
8485301 we knew we had to play well and we did
8485302 we played the kind of football were expected and used to playing we didnt turn the ball over we made good decisions we limited our mental mistakes and converted third downs thats the kind of football we want to play when the regular season hits well polish things up this week and get ready for minnesota
8485303 i think its good preparation for the season coming up its going to be good for me a learning experience to go against the first team defense see what it feels like just see how far along i am
8485304 and really preseason to me is about finding out as much information as you possibly can not only about your team but about the individuals this will give us a great look at a lot of guys that are fighting for jobs
8485305 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8485306 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8485307 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8485308 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon
8485309 the wm printclient message is sent to a window to request that it draw its client area in the specified device context most commonly in a printer device context
8485310 thats very different from taking money out of social security and making a personal account part of todays benefit structure
8485311 politically the charge is understandable but factually what mccain is proposing is different
8485312 i cannot tell you what i would do except to put everything on the table
8485313 there is nothing thats off the table i have my positions and ill articulate them but nothings off the table
8485314 i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
8485315 joe biden has certainly been a good example of a working class kid who grew up and got himself a scholarship to a great university worked really hard and has really made good
8485316 one of the least wealthy members of the u s senate i think he remembers his roots and i think hed tell you what a great country this is given his own experiences
8485317 in the most recent rankings 2006 he was the least wealthy poorest i guess you could say of the senators
8485318 hasnt changed much i suspect hes still at the bottom of the list
8485319 and isnt bill clinton partly responsible for why our military needs to be rebuilt
8485320 oh theres no hardship we just want to walk away from the property
8485321 we need to be pragmatic and move beyond rhetoric to make progress as we move towards copenhagen
8485322 there is a real need to strengthen the capacity of countries particularly in africa to cope with such climate shocks
8485323 i would therefore like to call for an international deal or compact in which developing countries commit to plan for climate resilient development
8485324 parties meeting under the kyoto protocol must swiftly reach agreement on the rules and tools that will be available to developed countries to meet future emission reduction targets beyond 2012
8485325 this is essential because the toolbox will in turn determine the level of ambition of developed countries when setting their new targets
8485326 because forest products are traded globally and some of the drivers of deforestation are the result of international pressures countries agreed that there needs to be properly designed incentives for all countries to ensure that reductions in one country dont lead to increases elsewhere i e leakage
8485327 this is a movement from the previous situation where you had countries in each stage essentially elbowing to make their stage of deforestation the main focus of incentives
8485328 parties will look not only at what is needed in terms of funding but also at how funding should be generated in the context of a new international deal and precisely what technologies are required
8485329 the debate will also give an indication of the infrastructure needed to implement a shared vision in the areas of finance technology and capacity bulding

8485355 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8485356 these hypocrites who turn a blind eye to mccains dirty past but sure didnt waste a single solitary second
8485357 the fbi shouldnt have the unreviewable power to impose gag orders on the recipients of national security letters
8485358 as the district court ruled the fbis power to silence the recipients of these letters has to be subject to judicial oversight without that check the fbi can use its power to hide abuses and silence its critics and thats exactly what its been doing
8485359 this amendment violates not only the first amendments strong presumption in favor of free speech but also impermissibly limits the capacity of courts to behave as courts and to adjudicate fairly the propriety of any gag order

8485366 tommy i dont think youll ever find him but i am absolutely certain that he will find you
8485367 tommy ive thought about you so often i hear you are sick
8485368 whats it like to be only twenty four and dying
8485369 well like being fifty and having no values or ideals like being fifty and thinking that booze seducing women and making money are the real biggies in life
8485370 is something you said to me on the last day of class he remembered
8485371 i asked you if you thought i would ever find god and you said no which surprised me then you said but he will find you i thought about that a lot even though my search for god was hardly intense at that time
8485372 but when the doctors removed a lump from my groin and told me that it was malignant then i got serious about locating god
8485373 did you ever try anything for a long time with great effort and with no success
8485374 i decided to spend what time i had left doing something more profitable
8485375 dad i love you i just wanted you to know that
8485376 then one day i turned around and god was there
8485377 but the important thing is that he was there he found me you were right
8485378 i think you are saying something very important and much more universal than you realize
8485379 tom think about it if and when you are ready give me a call in a few days tommy called said he was ready for the class that he wanted to do that for god and for me so we scheduled a date however he never made it he had another appointment far more important than the one with me and my class of course his life was not really ended by his death only changed he made the great step from faith into vision he found a life far more beautiful than the eye of man has ever seen or the ear of man has ever heard or the mind of man has ever imagined before he died we talked one last time tell the whole world for me
8485380 i will tom ill tell them ill do my best
8485381 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is becoming the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird

8485395 when i came into defence and thought we get a fair bit of money what do we spend it on but it was very hard to track it all down
8485396 at least within my group we now have a work plan that shows what it is were allocating resources to
8485397 we were working with something like 130 different vendors in the infrastructure space and 350 in the application space
8485398 it wasnt possible for us to have proper engagement and understand what we were about and build a relationship
8485399 theres no point putting out bundles of services we need to understand the markets position and how we bundle services
8485400 this isnt a philosophical debate around whether nothing should be outsourced or everything should be outsourced
8485401 we need to make a decision based our value proposition there are some things that wed probably never outsource
8485402 they were quite low level problems but fundamental to having any further discussion and engagement

8485418 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8485419 the message i heard tonight was america its time to rise up and these are the leaders who embody what we are and its time to capture that again we must have the courage to change we have to change even the greatest nation in the world can realize its mistake and such realization will allow us to reclaim our moral authority in the world
8485420 you could see the sons eyes welled up with tears appropriately so
8485421 i thought it was extraordinary i was incredibly moved my joe bidens story by his sons introduction its clear why hes on the ticket hes going to be a tremendous asset
8485422 its an inspiration and hopefully the start to a great campaign
8485423 this should be a coronation not an election but the republicans will unleash negative ads against barack that will make the swift boating of kerry look like kindergarten
8485424 they have to distort the truth to get elected we dont but we have to speak the truth and speak it with toughness throughout this campaign
8485425 but we have to speak the truth and speak it with toughness throughout this campaign
8485426 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8485427 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8485428 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8485429 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8485430 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8485431 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8485432 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8485433 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8485434 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8485435 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8485549 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8485550 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8485551 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8485552 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

8485561 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8485562 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8485563 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8485564 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8485565 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8485566 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8485567 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8485568 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8485569 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8485570 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that
8485571 this is great coming to the ballpark every day and fighting for a playoff spot makes it even better

8485601 during the falkland war the british government said the gurkhas are an integral part of the british army
8485602 yes i remember reading about it it was because the argentinians protested in the uno that the british were deploying mercenary soldiers
8485603 for our bravery and loyalty the queen of england awarded us 6 500 decorations including 13 victoria crosses and two george cross medals but you can t live on medals alone you know mr singh

8485649 the bank of england is losing the battle when it comes to influencing british inflation expectations
8485650 the timing and the forum used for the comment are ominous the cpi m and its leader seem to be ready to forego the interest of the working class in their eagerness to keep the capitalists in good humour do they believe that communism as a dictum of societal transformation is finished
8485651 on the contrary the relevance of bandh seems to have grown as the interests of the working class and the farmers are facing grave threats from the sponsors of globalisation we would not forego the right to strike
8485652 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
8485653 its a picture about good and evil right and wrong
8485654 but how can you draw a picture about wrong that is right
8485655 whatever i draw is right even that which i let look wrong to those i draw to observe it so its something in the lighting and my drawing you see keep observing i will not explain further until the picture is complete come close little one so that i may ask you a question now why do you suppose i would draw you here to ask me annoying questions when im trying to work
8485656 well i suppose i uh eh i dont know why well it seems to me that you must know all about your own art say why dont you just draw me to stop it huh
8485657 what youre drawing me to do is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
8485658 i suppose i can wait until the picture is complete
8485659 very well and besides the answer does not exist yet in any form that you can understand you see ive not drawn you to understand it yet but perhaps you can think of it in this way as i work for now making a picture about good and evil consists of drawing the line someplace
8485660 why are things this way rather than that i can think of things my way and want them to be so so why should they not be my way why
8485661 say they are a little like me in that way a rather likable likeness if i do say so myself so i suppose their next question about what will be will be why dont you just take their will away
8485662 only i know as i know all of my own art yet i would think that some of the answers about the will would be rather obvious if you will
8485663 ah but what if i knew you knew see how my knowledge increases to approach your own
8485664 well can you draw me to have some of your knowledge
8485665 for now you do not even have the symbols imagery in your head or the forms of thought necessary to think many of my thoughts so some of the best truths about my art and this picture will remain ineffable and paradoxical to you that is my will if you are willing to learn how my will must be done in all of my pictures then i will naturally draw you to have more knowledge of my nature
8485666 going through withdrawal over here very painful do your duty and post something man
8485667 the very first thing i tell my new students on the first day of a workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth

8485676 just because its not in the newspaper doesnt mean everything is finished and folks whove been down and seen the damage understand that
8485677 its awesome when you see people like that who hadnt had electricity for 18 months with tears in their eyes
8485678 its pretty fresh for us and i think that has a lot to do with the perspective of people wanting to help
8485679 i dont want people to forget theres still a tremendous amount of work to do down there

8485686 the letter from the state home secretary mr ashok mohan chakrabarty which reached us today is addressed to the party president mr bimal gurung it states that the tripartite meeting will be convened on 8 september in new delhi
8485687 it is a positive sign from the government and we welcome it the letter states that talks will revolve around the morcha demand which obviously means gorkhaland
8485688 it is a positive move and we should all respect it
8485689 all the police stations in siliguri have been instructed to impound vehicles featuring gl number plates and arrest the persons including the driver of such vehicles stern action would also be taken if anyone tries to tar the west bengal number plates here
8485690 the creative process is a process of surrender not control

8485692 perjanjian pangkor 1874 sebagai titik mula dilihat bagaimana inggeris menghormati islam dan tahu mana kekuatan yang ada pada orang melayu islam mereka tahu batasan orang melayu iaitu islam inggeris memutuskan bahawa soal agama diurus oleh sultan dan soal pentadbiran dikendalikan oleh residen inggeris kenapa ini berlaku kerana inggeris tahu bahawa orang melayu sensitif terhadap agama mereka
8485693 the main reason why such forum should be allowed to be held is that it did not only invite the non muslims as speakers there were muslim speakers who were invited to air their views in the said forum these three speakers i believe were competent to defend the muslims interest in that forum when two out of the said three speakers pulled out from the forum at the eleventh hour the inescapable conclusion was that the muslim scholars were not ready to engage intellectually with other non muslim speakers in that forum the pulling out with respect was not the good option
8485694 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
8485695 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster

8485703 and the show itself just seemed like an incredible fantasy to me because i didnt grow up around money
8485704 people are always interested in what is not like them
8485705 they know their friends and family they dont know the super rich some of this is curiosity some of it is envy some of it is jealousy some of it is snarkiness
8485706 its interesting because when you look at when shows like this were very popular dynasty and dallas back in the day they debuted when there were economic hard times
8485707 and so a lot of times when the country goes through times like these where were in what is perceived by many as a recession having entertainment be escapist entertainment is what our viewers look for
8485708 on one hand it is acceptable in popular culture to show a fantasy lifestyle contrary to what most people are experiencing think about the kind of escapist films produced during the great depression for instance on the other hand there is a fine balance that must be struck so that the public is not pushed into scoffing at or rejecting portrayals of wealth
8485709 you want to make sure that youre not alienating a lot of viewers across the country who might be in tough financial situations

8485719 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8485720 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8485721 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8485722 there may be some inner confidence that they can move those numbers closer to a majority
8485723 its good motivation for us but that motivation is already there
8485724 the gtx 260 is exceptionally powerful quiet even power miserly it too has dropped in price you can find them for around 200 with a rebate anyway although evgas ftw is more however i believe that the price premium is totally fair with the step up program warranty and ridiculous overclocking potential if the 280 is a heavyweight then the 260 is a ninja and everyone knows that ninjas are cooler
8485725 to start off the overclocking on the corsair xms2 dhx memory i started pushing the frequency up by changing the memory dividers on the motherboard bios i was able to get the memory to 1000mhz by loosening the memory timings to 5 5 5 15 and keeping the voltage at 2 1v i did try to get the ram to go to 1066mhz by raising the voltage to 2 2v however it would not remain stable at 5 5 5 15 i was able to get them stable at 6 5 5 18 but the scores were lower than at 1000mhz 5 5 5 15 so that is what i stuck at the overclocking tests will be run then at 1000mhz with timings of 5 5 5 15 at 2 1v which is a 20 overall overclock for these modules

8485739 pak saya ingin sekali menjadi penari kelas dunia apakah anda punya waktu sejenak untuk menilai saya menari saya ingin tahu pendapat anda tentang tarian saya
8485740 pak ada satu pertanyaan yang mengganjal di hati saya ini tentang penampilan saya sewaktu menari di hadapan anda bertahun tahun yang silam sebegitu jelekkah penampilan saya saat itu sehingga anda langsung pergi meninggalkan saya begitu saja tanpa mengatakan sepatah katapun
8485741 oh ya saya ingat peristiwanya terus terang saya belum pernah melihat tarian seindah yang kamu lakukan waktu itu saya rasa kamu akan menjadi penari kelas dunia saya tidak mengerti mengapa kamu tiba 2 berhenti dari dunia tari
8485742 sikap anda telah mencuri semua impian saya kalau memang tarian saya bagus mengapa anda meninggalkan saya begitu saja ketika saya baru menari beberapa menit anda seharusnya memuji saya dan bukan mengacuhkan saya begitu saja mestinya saya bisa menjadi penari kelas dunia bukan hanya menjadi pelayan toko
8485743 tidak tidak saya rasa saya telah berbuat dengan benar anda tidak harus minum anggur satu barel untuk membuktikan anggur itu enak demikian juga saya saya tidak harus menonton anda 10 menit untuk membuktikan tarian anda bagus malam itu saya juga sangat lelah setelah pertunjukkan maka sejenak saya tinggalkan anda untuk mengambil kartu nama saya dan berharap anda mau menghubungi saya lagi keesokan hari tapi anda sudah pergi ketika saya keluar dan satu hal yang perlu anda camkan bahwa anda mestinya fokus pada impian anda bukan pada ucapan atau tindakan saya lalu pujian kamu mengharapkan pujian ah waktu itu kamu sedang bertumbuh pujian itu seperti pedang bermata dua ada kalanya memotivasimu bisa pula melemahkanmu dan faktanya saya melihat bahwa sebagian besar pujian yang diberikan pada saat seseorang sedang bertumbuh hanya akan membuat dirinya puas dan pertumbuhannya berhenti saya justru lebih suka mengacuhkanmu agar hal itu bisa melecutmu bertumbuh lebih cepat lagi lagipula pujian itu sepantasnya datang dari keinginan saya sendiri tidak pantas anda meminta pujian dari orang lain
8485744 anda lihat ini sebenarnya hanyalah masalah sepele seandainya anda pada waktu itu tidak menghiraukan apa yang terjadi dan tetap menari mungkin hari ini anda sudah menjadi penari kelas dunia

8485797 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8485798 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8485799 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8485800 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing

8485825 because we will dedicate next wednesday to the extraordinary event that occurred on the road to damascus pauls conversion an essential change in his life that followed from his meeting with christ today we will pause briefly on the whole of his life
8485826 in fact the celebration of the pauline year we are observing follows this chronology the year 2008 was chosen thinking of his birth more or less in the year 8
8485827 in any case paul was born in tarsus in cilicia a jew of the diaspora he spoke greek although having a name of latin origin derived by assonance from the hebrew original saul saulos and he held roman citizenship
8485828 paul seems to be situated therefore on the border of the various cultures roman greek hebrew and perhaps also because of this was disposed to fruitful universal openness to a mediation between cultures to a true universality
8485829 to be understood probably as a laborer of coarse goats wool or linen fibers to make mats or tents
8485830 left tarsus and went to jerusalem to be educated at the feet of rabbi gamaliel the elder nephew of the great rabbi hillel according to the most rigid norms of pharisaism acquiring a great zeal for the mosaic torah
8485831 paul passed into history more as a christian what is more as an apostle than as a pharisee his apostolic activity is subdivided traditionally on the basis of three missionary journeys to which is added a fourth his journey to rome as a prisoner all are narrated by luke in the acts
8485832 in troas another important event took place in a dream paul saw a macedonian from the other side of the sea namely in europe who said come and help us
8485833 it was the future europe that requested the help and light of the gospel
8485834 in this brief account of pauls journeys suffice it to take into account how he dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without sparing his energy and facing a series of grave trials of which he has left us an account in the second letter to the corinthians
8485835 we see a determination that is explained only by a soul truly fascinated by the light of the gospel enamored of christ a soul sustained by a profound conviction that it is necessary to take the light of christ to the world to proclaim the gospel to all
8485836 this i think is what stays with us from this brief account of st
8485837 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays

8485968 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
8485969 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
8485970 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8485971 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
8485972 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
8485973 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
8485974 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8485975 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
8485976 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
8485977 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
8485978 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
8485979 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
8485980 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8485981 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
8485982 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
8485983 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
8485984 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
8485985 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
8485986 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
8485987 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
8485988 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

8485992 no amount of therapy can ever erase the fact that i may have killed men that i didnt even know
8485993 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8485994 mr biden who sought the democratic presidential nomination himself this year before pulling out after performing poorly in the first contest in iowa has shown himself to be a tough political brawler a characteristic that many democrats say mr obama has not displayed against mr mccain that is something that presidential candidates typically look for in a running mate
8485995 i think he obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8485996 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off

8486021 this eliminates face to face verbal communication with clients that really allows you to build rapport with the clients
8486022 portfolio managers are only concerned about returns but there is still a trust factor that needs to be built in with any buy sell side relationship and i find that at the beginning this system ignores that fact

8486127 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
8486128 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
8486129 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
8486130 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8486131 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
8486132 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
8486133 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
8486134 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8486135 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
8486136 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
8486137 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
8486138 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
8486139 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
8486140 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8486141 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
8486142 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
8486143 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
8486144 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
8486145 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
8486146 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
8486147 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
8486148 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
8486149 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
8486150 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
8486151 i am very pleased to have closed this financing with such a prestigious group of investors
8486152 this funding will allow us to move quickly to establish our first manufacturing facility to produce cost effective pv modules
8486153 in the last few years weve seen many companies with plans to commercialize products for the solar industry our commitment to ava solar is founded both on the commercial readiness of the product and their management and engineering teams demonstrated ability to deliver
8486154 avas approach to manufacturing technology is uniquely positioned to meet the markets need for large scale installations at a cost that enables grid parity
8486155 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade
8486156 obama may simply be saying that this is something for god to decide not him
8486157 im uh sorry but this issue is uh above my pay grade ill have to withhold judgment and uh recuse myself from votes

8486165 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays
8486166 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8486167 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8486168 these projects are our way of saying thank you to the people of denver our gracious hosts this week but our work today is also out of support and great admiration for the troops who are serving our country abroad and keeping us safe at home my family is thrilled to be here today to send a few comforts of home to our soldiers overseas
8486169 we hope the more than one thousand delegates taking part in the many service projects across denver today will carry that commitment to service back to help their communities long after our convention is over
8486170 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8486171 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion

8486175 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8486176 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog
8486177 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8486178 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line
8486179 duff mckagan sold more than 90 million albums between 1987 and 1993
8486180 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8486181 tmx did not announce changes to the pricing last quarter and its pretty clear that they were waiting to see what alpha did
8486182 this is going to create considerable cost savings for all dealers and market participants
8486183 bravest warriors in the world there is virtually no applause from the assembled democrats
8486184 how are we going to heat the home this winter
8486185 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8486186 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8486187 the lpga wants koreans to speak passable english but the tours own leadership cant communicate that fact to the players with anything approaching clarity hows that for irony
8486188 first thing she said to the camera was i need a beer i still remember that sponsors must be proud
8486189 i need a massive influx of fat and calories so hand me a big mac
8486190 next year there will be lpga events in thailand singapore china korea and japan and the tour has said it has its eye on india and the middle east as well
8486191 will americans who win in those countries be expected to give their speech in the local language
8486192 suspension is too harsh a penalty an lpga card is earned from talent now that status can be taken away for a reason other than talent theres something fundamentally wrong with this concept
8486193 over the last 10 years there have been a number of decisions in this area and the courts have consistently decreed that it is permissible for an employer to mandate english only for two narrow reasons safety
8486194 with regards to the lpga safety is obviously a non factor so the issue becomes is the language a player speaks fundamental to the competition i would not want to be the one who has to make that case
8486195 legal businesses and membership organizations have the right to make certain requirements that are fundamental to their businesses
8486196 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8486197 obviously some people are natural talkers and some people arent what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning new language they have a learning disability thats tough to ask somebody with a learning disability who might have found golf as the saving grace in their life to ask them to learn a different language or else you cant play
8486198 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8486199 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8486200 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8486201 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8486202 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8486203 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8486204 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8486205 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8486206 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8486207 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8486208 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8486209 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8486210 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8486211 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8486212 you always want to see the big league team do well
8486213 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8486214 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8486215 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8486216 i think the race will come down to the end
8486217 i thought fausto got better as the game wore on
8486218 i felt the best that i have all year tonight
8486219 i had good stuff its funny i had nothing in kansas city in my last start and won and tonight i lost
8486220 tonight is just the epitome of how this year has gone for me
8486221 but ill stay positive and continue to go out there work hard and do the things this club needs
8486222 thats what youre taught to do in the little leagues to hustle
8486223 run balls out whether you hit a ground ball or whether youre on second or first you run the ball out and thats what i did
8486224 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8486225 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8486226 never take a course where they make you read beowulf
8486227 we are not stupid we would not be the type of people to be impressed by simple jack
8486228 and if this director wishes to call us savages then we will instruct him as to the real meaning of savage
8486229 where i come from drug dealers threatening to break your legs or kill you was an everyday thing this is like being back in new york on those streets ill just have to ride strapped is all
8486230 im married to a jew ive got nothing to lose
8486231 dear fans in columbus i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8486232 until you hear from me again remember you are the sun i am the moon you are the words i am the tune forgive me i love you
8486233 we arrived at the island after three months at sea and the captain told the 30 of us that the ship would sail again in 15 days
8486234 however when i came back 15 days later the ship had already left with the others and i had to beg on the streets
8486235 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8486236 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8486237 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8486238 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8486239 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision
8486240 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8486241 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8486242 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8486243 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8486244 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8486245 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8486246 our capital position is strong and prudent and will remain an area of focus during this period of uncertain market conditions
8486247 getting back on track to deliver consistent and sustainable performance
8486248 to the extent that this diminishes the probability of another equity raise this will be seen as a positive
8486249 the subprime charges will be large and we suspect thats next quarter
8486250 this survey reveals that there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8486251 they the fda were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8486252 while a definite causal relationship between byetta and pancreatitis has not been proved to better understand the suspected relationship amylin and lilly continue to pursue a comprehensive drug safety program that includes extensive internal and external review of individual cases and clinical and

8486254 im of the opinion the state shouldnt own any golf courses
8486255 the screen is so bright compared to my other laptop

8486260 we cant have a statue of liberty welcoming immigrants to our country as we build a wall on the southern border instead let us build bridges of friendship and cooperation with our southern neighbors
8486261 we just want to ensure that everyone knows our goals of the convention and the message of change that were getting across
8486262 they never said it was for content they said they wanted it to be 280 words but when you read it they took out the meat of the message
8486263 as an excuse to trample on the civil liberties of our people
8486264 i dont mind getting older as long as i get better
8486265 the ministers welcomed the substantive progress made in the negotiations on the asean china investment agreement and underscored the importance of concluding the agreement by the 12th asean china summit in december 2008
8486266 if very little preference is extended to the filipino vis vis the japanese investors under the jpepa what is the value of being a filipino in your own national economy
8486267 as developing nations we need to be provided with some opportunities to prepare ourselves better to respond
8486268 i know the argument is going to be that we had five six seven years whatever to raise these issues but that for us doesnt make the case
8486269 the fact of the matter is that we are presently not very prepared or as prepared as we would want to be to open up our markets to powerful trading blocs like the european union
8486270 right now as it is it appears as though we are throwing out everything carte blanche to the europeans there is no provision in the agreement for us to get back around the bargaining table in six 12 or 18 months whatever it is and review the performance
8486271 as it now stands if the epa as is is signed and it does not perform in the best interest of the caribbean and the jamaican people we have no recourse and we are saying that is not fair to us we need to have a system where we can sit down and review it
8486272 we are not outrightly opposed to an economic partnership agreement it is part of what the world requires now for you to exist but we are saying that it must be done properly and it must be done in the interest of the people of the caribbean and not just the big companies in europe

8486306 author also fails to acknowledge what economic libertarians really say that it s immoral to take what is not yours whether it belongs to someone in the 001 percentile or in the 90th percentile
8486307 the fallacy of this argument is that human beings do not measure their well being by absolute real income or longevity
8486308 why should i work my butt off when i see my paycheck shrinking in terms of what i can afford to feed my family pay my mortgage and pay my ever increasing insurance premiums and uncovered medical expenses
8486309 a less educated person would be more prone to many of the problems cited by the author if so should these people be rewarded for the choices they have made
8486310 the paradox of economic growth is that the same mechanisms that create great wealth
8486311 they get richer and more powerful in the usa because they were rich and powerful to begin with i

8486436 tiu c societatea noastra nu a ajuns la nivelul celor din
8486437 i never thought id live this long to see this
8486438 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8486439 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8486440 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
8486441 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
8486442 im proud of my country im 63 i was refused buying a candy bar when i was 7 years old i have been refused trying to purchase a home in an all white neighborhood this is nothing short of a miracle
8486443 i can hardly describe how i feel i am so excited
8486444 when i think about civil rights activist medgar evers who lost his life registering people to vote we have come a long way in this country and we need a man like barack obama to lead us into the future
8486445 one of the greatest things that ever happened in my 86 years
8486446 i know medgar martin luther king and others never dreamed they would see this day forty five years ago we couldnt do this medgar was killed 45 years ago trying to get the right to be heard period
8486447 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8486448 the sportsmanship of hillary clinton really made women even greater
8486449 when barack became her candidate he became mine it was difficult because it was a bitter battle between two qualified very talented candidates for presidency
8486450 its going to take me awhile because ive been supporting her so long
8486451 but i intend to vote for obama i intend to put an obama sign in my yard and a bumper sticker on my car and to work for him so we can win this election
8486452 he wasnt my no 1 candidate but hes my no 1 candidate now because hes going to make a difference in my life
8486453 its who we represent who elected us we represent the 18 million voters out there our vote is their voice all of us are pretty passionate about that and feel that its not over until then
8486454 after that then we get to step back and then move forward and help elect a democrat into the white house
8486455 we just have to move on and i understand that and i am supporting obama
8486456 the sense of urgency was made very very clear the party is unified
8486457 i think it will change america in more ways than anyone realizes yet
8486458 once we get past that threshold of the first black president it will throw off many chains that bind us and make us the great country we were meant to be
8486459 the base motor is a 2 4 liter 190 horsepower four cylinder with 16 valves and hondas i vtec variable valve technology it also offers a 3 5 liter 268 horsepower
8486460 my name is barack obama and i am kofi the commentator on that great american blog urbanagora
8486461 as you know illinois is my home state and i make it my business to follow closely the political discourse that happens there let me be honest since i made that speech in 2004 i havent really had to do anything i have pretty much been coasting on that
8486462 so in 2006 i began reading the blog and eventually started to contribute
8486463 now most of you will be surprised given the seeming disparity between kofis views and my public platform
8486464 so the kofi identity has been great as it acts like a pressure valve to all this crap i have to keep shoveling day in and day out i mean really this is just ridiculous and you all keep buying it wholesale
8486465 but the real reason i am speaking out is because of one of the commentators
8486466 i havent won crap yet so quit acting like i have and above all else dont make allusions to death disease and destruction because someone else disagrees with you the liberals and conservatives both agree that is some truly petty shit and makes all of us look bad
8486467 so noun verb hope noun verb change yes we can yes we can dont screw this up for me
8486468 the open source development model is unique end users not only give feedback on the software theyre a fundamental and critical part of the community submitting patches and developing new features themselves
8486469 before this event however there was no neutral forum that would advance and optimize this collaboration the end user summit will fill this gap and accelerate problem solving for linux
8486470 the grandmother convinces without evil her son in law to return to france with rose in february 2005
8486471 it was still very young i tried to convince me that it made its crisis of adolescence and that it would return
8486472 the existence of the young girl rocks then once again
8486473 his her mother made a total rejection of this child it wanted to make it adopt
8486474 small one was completely disturbed takes again his her grandmother
8486475 i dont have to specify the order by because i know that it will return rows in sorted order it always does every time i promise
8486476 where does it say that the system will not return the rows in order
8486477 a way to order the rows that come back from a query
8486478 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8486479 i was tooyoung and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8486480 i dont believe in darwinism because it 2 hrs ago
8486481 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8486482 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week
8486483 weve not got players who play for england but so many who go all around the world when these international weeks come up it takes a lot away from our training and preparation
8486484 we know weve got ourselves off the hook but we were not guilty of complacency
8486485 its just that we seemed to lose all our rhythm against a team which scored two quick goals and kept coming with their tails up
8486486 happily we refound our rhythm and got two wonderful goals from jimmy and danny
8486487 we learned a lot of lessons without paying the full price jimmys very disappointed with himself after his second half performance but again hes proved that good players can always come up with something special
8486488 maybe its an unfair result and we should have had a penalty in the first half
8486489 no worries itll be a good little warm up and ill see some stunning alpine scenery then ill grind my way up dhuez
8486490 is the cup half full or is it half empty
8486491 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8486492 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8486493 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8486494 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8486495 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8486496 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8486497 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8486498 but the way he finished his goal you cannot teach that he has that naturally
8486499 you can see many transfers announced in the media every day but it takes a lot of time and does not always happen
8486500 i was sat here yesterday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8486501 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8486502 arsenal are further on than us they have played premier league games and it showed they were fitter and stronger than they were two weeks ago
8486503 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that today
8486504 its been a great experience for the players they are a young team and they need these experiences to learn
8486505 we are in the uefa cup the season starts on saturday and there is still a lot to play for
8486506 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8486507 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8486508 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8486509 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8486510 you dont get anything when you come to these places
8486511 it was scandalous typical of the referees a ridiculous decision
8486512 we played very well im delighted with the players but they didnt deserve the referee spoiling the game for them
8486513 people will think it is sour grapes but we didnt get a decision all night and izak reid is now distraught
8486514 i told the referee but they dont listen any more that is why they need half an hour after the game to get their story together im not saying we would have won it but we would have had a better chance
8486515 you admire his way of playing and remain surprised by the effort that he puts into every game and for how he trains
8486516 i dont know our rivals sufficiently to say what are chances are but the champions league is a rather difficult competition
8486517 mourinho is an expert and the players have gained experience this could be our year
8486518 when this team has had time to work together we will win games 2 0 and 3 0 not 1 0
8486519 i have only worked with the team for one month so we will get much better
8486520 roma is very strong and has experience and you need to put them at the top of the list of contenders because they also have an excellent coach
8486521 milan despite the poor preseason results has tradition on its side and the return of ronaldinho should be kept in consideration juventus always has character and fiorentina could be the outsider
8486522 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8486523 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8486524 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8486525 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8486526 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8486527 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8486528 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8486529 daarop is ook te zien dat ik twee spelers in mijn gezichtsveld had en het voorval niet kon waarnemen

8486547 he mccain still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence

8486582 there are so many different characters people really are being open in a way that i didnt expect they would be
8486583 its basically going to be a doc about the day to day operations and how a mayor runs a city and how he holds onto his potlical integrity and his humanity while trying to balance the thin wire of perception from both the media and the public

8486588 by working with pro formance to conduct validation testing ford is proving that eco driving techniques are teachable and work across a broad spectrum of vehicles and drivers
8486589 its a great initiative for ford to lead in this country its not the end all solution for america to obtain energy independence but it is an important part of it
8486590 we are talking with fleet owners first because they have large numbers of vehicles and drivers that could realize significant benefit from such training
8486591 ultimately all drivers can benefit from practicing eco driving and one day it may be considered mandatory as part of all new drivers training
8486592 improving fuel economy requires commitment from all stakeholders including automakers regulators fuel producers and consumers ford will continue to do its part to improve fuel economy with new technologies across its vehicle lineup
8486593 as part of our fuel efficiency strategy we strongly encourage our customers to put eco driving tips into practice
8486594 the result for the permatang pauh by election is already out and the decision favours anwar so he will be sworn in on thursday
8486595 the election commission has been effective no one can force me not to allow anwar to take his oath tomorrow there is no reason why we cannot have the swearing in tomorrow
8486596 it can be done anywhere including my office as long as he does it within 60 days
8486597 there is no need for everyone to come anwars supporters this is just an ordinary sitting with the permatang pauh seat vacated by anwars wife datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail and we had a by election and we know that anwar is the elected representative
8486598 politics is a game what is today will be differenswearing in i believe the speaker will announce the appointment of the new opposition leader
8486599 we are glad with the victory in permatang pauh with great majority and we are sending a clear message to umno and barisan nasional that the people wanted a new politics
8486600 i know you will find a good home for her
8486601 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8486602 this by election is not just life and death for anwar but also for pkr and pakatan rakyat but for bn its just a seat and which did not belong to it but to pkr before the by election
8486603 anwars victory also does not affect the current government leadership pak lah datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi is still the kepala batas member of parliament and prime minister while datuk seri najib razak is still pekan mp and deputy prime minister
8486604 judging from the presence of 50 000 of his supporters on nomination day he should have received about the same number of votes or won by at least a 20 000 vote majority
8486605 but the difference in anwars 15 000 vote majority and his wifes datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail in the last general election is small
8486606 i hope with anwars re entry into parliament the sitting of which will resume tomorrow the proceedings will be more decorous the people want to see the demeanour of someone anwar who aspires to be prime minister and who can set a good example to other parliamentarians especially his colleagues in the opposition
8486607 although it was just a by election it could be an indication of a trend that the voters had already decided that they wanted changes even if they didnt know what the changes were and refused to accept bns leadership
8486608 it is clear that we need to make swift changes to the organisation and to the way we do things
8486609 are fairer not racial based politics but one that is based on the profile of the multiracial and multi religious malaysians
8486610 it may be that whatever is said about anwar the people and voters just refuse to believe it
8486611 the explanation given by our leaders was not accepted as though it was already decided from the outset that the bn would lose and pkr would win
8486612 daddy knows best yes this is the news in 90 second segments officially produced and aired again and again and again by the little black and white pawns of the network yes men while the stars are going out and the stripes are getting bent

8486614 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8486620 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8486621 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8486622 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8486623 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8486628 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8486629 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
8486630 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8486631 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8486632 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8486633 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year
8486634 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8486635 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8486636 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum
8486637 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock
8486638 today new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8486639 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8486640 among rich developed nations only iceland has a higher level of national debt on such a measure
8486641 what we are seeing through kiwisaver is nothing short of a savings revolution in this country
8486642 it was done to capture the value gap between listed and trade sale prices for similar assets in other jurisdictions and bbws share price and what this implies for the valuation of the portfolio
8486643 not less than nine cents per security fully cash deferred
8486644 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8486645 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8486646 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8486647 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8486648 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8486649 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8486650 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8486651 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8486652 we are going to be announcing that well be extending again for another 14 days

8486666 we national fatwa council feel that after the legal process has taken place any of the parties who feels he had been violated or victimised could resort to muhabalah involving both parties
8486667 islamic law is fair so the people should not worry whether the case should be resolved through the legal process in court or outside court through sumpah mubahalah which should involve both parties but not necessarily at the same place
8486668 go through the legal process first anyway it there are too many of such swearing it would lose its value and people will no longer believe in it

8486679 its great to know that ive been here since day one
8486680 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8486681 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8486682 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me
8486683 i came back to replace the experience that was lost when awen guttenbeil and sione faumuina left
8486684 ive played how i wanted so it s been a successful second stint in my eyes
8486685 achieving the top eight and making the playoffs at the end of the year are always fond memories
8486686 to be involved in it for a number of seasons has been fantastic because making the final series is always a huge thing
8486687 im looking to play one more season in the uk i wouldnt be able to play in the nrl for another team
8486688 its not always wise to start someone in that situation when the games very intense
8486689 but to come off the bench hed be pretty good the two strikers were probably the two outstanding players last week
8486690 its important we find out exactly where were at at this stage of the season
8486691 theyve changed their formation virtually every game ive seen them play in the pre season and the first two rounds
8486692 i would say garys either trying to change a couple of things so all we can do is focus on what we do well
8486693 we must anticipate the problems we may face in the future and be ready to make decisions to counter them
8486694 our people are used to very low cost of living services and food and they are not prepared to face a high cost of living i think we need to learn from countries with a high cost of living how do they survive how do they prosper and how to be competitive
8486695 if we do not do that then i think we cannot achieve vision 2020
8486696 malaysia is the most planned country in the world but people do not follow the plans prepared for them if people had followed the plans we would have been a developed country by now
8486697 fortunate for malaysia we do have an implementation unit and the economic planning unit
8486698 i have spent 22 years trying to change the mindset of the malays for example and i must admit that i have failed in that but people wont give any more time
8486699 people think for a multiracial country we are doing rather well but even then we need to be extremely careful

8486744 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8486745 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8486746 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8486747 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8486748 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points

8486790 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8486794 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8486795 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8486796 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8486797 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8486798 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8486799 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8486800 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8486801 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8486802 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8486803 at about 3 30 this afternoon inside the denver posts pepsi center hq at the democratic national convention with cameras in hand filmmakers aj schnack and julia reichert amp steven bognar a lion in the house huddled around the papers political team the unit was buzzing because barack obama had just arrived in the city while across town rage against the machine was performing live and inside the hall the presidential candidates name was placed into nomination with the roll call about to begin later inside the convention hall schnack and filmmaker paul taylor we are together worked the floor and followed other post reporters filmmakers schnack bognar reichert taylor laura poitras my country my country and daniel junge they killed sister dorothy are among those trailing post editor curtis hubbard and reporter allison sherry denver host committee president elbra wedgeworth and mayor hickenloopers staff to capture the stories behind the scenes at this years event the film is simply titled convention
8486804 so why are the democrats so timorous about making that point

8486821 what the mind can concieve and believe it can achieve
8486822 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8486823 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8486824 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8486825 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8486826 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8486827 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8486828 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8486829 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8486830 they wanted to throw a bunch of producers at me

8486832 my uncle taught me that it was all about the bass line
8486833 i bought a guitar and worked on it for two weeks until i could play that little run it was just fantastic

8486838 well be signing a contract with a dog and one understudy
8486839 to get into a roundabout you have to slow down to about 15 to 20 miles an hour
8486840 it makes it a safer situation versus the conventional four way signal light intersection where you might have someone going through at 45 miles an hour
8486841 it comes down to the amount of space you need to leave between you and the car ahead of you the faster you go the more headway you need its another one of these odd things if you look at traffic as a system it often behaves differently than the way we think it would
8486842 the merge is going to have to happen somewhere but in a congested situation its best just to take advantage of that road capacity
8486843 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
8486844 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
8486845 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
8486846 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
8486847 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
8486848 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8486849 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8486850 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8486851 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

8486863 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8486864 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8486865 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8486866 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8486873 the bbb has issued this advisory because the company identified as the national yellow pages online has a pattern of consumer complaints and has failed to correct the underlying reason for the complaints
8486874 in addition to taking complaints from a total of 91 businesses in 30 states the chicago bbb has received complaints from several businesses in the chicago area
8486875 representatives state that they are calling to re enroll the complainants businesses into the online business listings
8486876 these telemarketing tactics place the responsibility for understanding the effects of what national yellow pages online is attempting to do on the person receiving the call
8486877 a great deal of the complaints stem from some of our clients employees over stepping their boundaries of authority when accepting orders
8486878 the continuation of listing business is what our charges represent

8486905 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
8486906 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
8486907 the exact budget i will come up with but it will be somewhere between 600 000 and 750 000 with about a third of it going directly to the bush library
8486908 cheneys possible definitely the national security adviser stephen hadley definitely either dr rice or i think a meeting with dr rice or the deputy secretary john negroponte is possible
8486909 the main thing is that he the asian politician comes and hes well received that he meets with high level people and we send positive statements made back from the administration about this guy wasnt such a bad guy many people have done worse

8486915 we the to watch the contortions over that new yorker cover cartoon of the obamas is to understand whom it is impermissible to offend in the america of 2008
8486916 president obama and first lady as seen from the right wing point of view
8486917 this cartoon is intended to make fun of conservatives as ignorant racists and essentially marginalize any criticism of obama as moronic
8486918 its not a satire about obama its a satire about the distortions and misconceptions and prejudices about obama
8486919 its the mass media at its worst it perpetuates false information and its highly inflammatory it gives credibility to whats been circulating for months and thats what makes it dangerous
8486920 what theyre going to try is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky

8486923 the republican convention is going to have an exciting side convention i think ron pauls crowd is coming out they could have 6 000 to 10 000 there for the campaign for liberty a big rally tuesday of the republican convention i dont think ron paul is going to endorse the republican candidate
8486924 look this is our responsibility these are our families the white society is not responsible for our kids dropping out of schools or using drugs or going on welfare we are
8486925 the white community is responsible and theyve got to solve our problems
8486926 barack obama should be demanding more government programs for african americans
8486927 its a figment of your imagination and its a mental recession youve got
8486928 we live in a very inter connected world today a world where more and more of our lives take place on the internet as a result pieces of our lives or at least breadcrumbs of where weve been and what weve been up to are left on servers across the internet and to illustrate that point let me relay a quick story from gnomedex
8486929 the zotac nitro arrived technic3d the nitro is based on a vfd display and is connected to the computer via a usb port the actual benefit of this device however is the fact that users can change the shader and memory clock of their zotac graphics card by simply pressing some buttons even while playing a game or using any other application causing a need to the performance of the graphics card increase or decrease it again later on once you reached settings out of the cards limits you can reset it to its defaults with another button we have check this with a presample from the nitro and a zotac 9800gtx in the preview
8486930 ubiquity is a firefox plugin currently in alpha stage its been receiving some attention so i figured id try it out short description meh
8486931 hes taking a liking to the job and hes done well overall i still think that he needs to throw a higher percentage of strikes but hes got good stuff and he likes the job weve still got a month to see him and well see where that takes us
8486932 i think hes done a great job especially the first couple of years coming out of the pen to be thrown into the savers role hes got a lot of talent and hes learned a lot and we trust him there hopefully hell be there a long time
8486933 i felt confident out there and i was just trying to throw strikes
8486934 and i was able to get my good slider out there today
8486935 ive been seeing the ball well and having good at bats
8486936 im just now starting to feel comfortable to where i was before
8486937 he looks aggressive like hes smelling blood when hes out there
8486938 he doesnt look as tentative as he was in the beginning of the season
8486939 the industry forces have been bearing down on the entire industry dealer network
8486940 frankly in the last four or five months its been very challenging to our dealers
8486941 if there was a pace there is no plan to be at two times the pace or three times the pace
8486942 at some point youre in competition with your fellow dealers
8486943 look at some of the other manufacturers that have quite a lot less number of dealers its going to make us stronger
8486944 now we can look to the future everything that was playing against us now is going for us
8486945 what is needed is an ending of premature and involuntary retirement and greater recognition and utilisation of older peoples skills and knowledge
8486946 such developments will allow older people to contribute more significantly to society
8486947 older people make a significant contribution to our communities adding cultural richness as well as sharing a wealth of experience knowledge and skills
8486948 while the objectives of josephine meckseper and mikhael subotzky are surely diverse the work of each artist exemplifies recent developments the reinvention of documentary practice in contemporary photography in subotzkys case and the expanding of the medium of photography into a series of artistic operations to expose the gray area between advertising politics and fashion in mecksepers case both artists endeavors attest to photographys potential for constructing documenting enacting and engaging with meaning in the world today
8486949 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8486950 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8486951 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8486952 ive got all the confidence in the world in this team but ill tell you what were going to be tested
8486953 every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches
8486954 we couldnt have been any worse the first two games
8486955 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8486956 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8486957 theres days were not good enough but we really try
8486958 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8486959 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8486960 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8486961 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit
8486962 sometimes it takes something like that to really get the juices flowing
8486963 you dont have to do stupid things like that to disrespect this game
8486964 like i said he did us a favor and we pulled through and im glad he did that
8486965 this is great coming to the ballpark every day and fighting for a playoff spot makes it even better
8486966 crogans vengeance is a marvelous swashbuckling tale im already anxiously awaiting a sequel or six chris schweizer is an amazingly talented cartoonist with an ear for dialogue and an eye for great storytelling
8486967 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8486968 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8486969 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8486970 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8486971 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8486972 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8486973 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8486974 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8486975 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8486976 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8487077 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8487078 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8487079 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock the rain came the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
8487080 unfettered by the traditions of the past a symbol of the nations faith in the future
8487081 he showed us drawings of villages and bullock carts of the beautiful women laborers
8487082 when we started designing houses here we thought of western houses
8487083 we began using those sunbreakers in a very big way
8487084 it was very a la mode but i did a study of the sun in chandigarh subsequently and found that sunbreakers
8487085 cut out sun but retained heat and dust we found it was better to create deep verandas these keep out rain and sun but allow life to move in and out as it always has done in an indian home
8487086 mi place foarte mult i asta anume pentru c este un cuv nt

8487089 dad are you gonna buckle me so i can be safe like dora
8487090 yeah bud im gonna buckle you so you can be safe like dora
8487091 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8487092 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8487093 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8487094 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8487095 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8487096 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8487097 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he

8487099 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8487100 hillary has told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8487101 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8487102 conversations around the kitchen table once the kids have gone to bed
8487103 tonight weve seen the passing of control of the democratic party from the clintons to obama and biden
8487104 it was interesting that when obama came on stage he was applauded but the crowd didnt go as wild as it did for the clintons
8487105 mr obama has really put the pressure on himself for tomorrow night
8487106 okay heres a new puzzle for you sleuthers to chew on
8487107 we never knew she was killed we thought she just ran away and still to this day avoided contacting anyone it is a complete shock and its very tough for everyone in my family
8487108 we are 99 5 percent sure that we know who she is omg i am reeling
8487109 i saw this pretty young girls photo and told myself that in this day and age of the internet and everything there just had to be a way to get her idd
8487110 nobody likes you and your type needs to go the last thing we need is more lezzies like you down there you suck
8487111 if the board knew who sent them i have no doubt that that person would be expelled from the club
8487112 i think hes a great statesman thats doing a great job i voted for him already in my early ballot hes got my vote
8487113 you acknowledge that mr ready distributed anti semitic literature at the january 19th meeting of the maricopa county republican party
8487114 what action was taken if distributing racist literature at an official meeting of the maricopa county republican party does not merit the removal of a precinct committeeman what does what message does it send that the maricopa county republican party has found time to censure our partys nominee for president of the united states but does not have the time or inclination to immediately remove a precinct committeeman with ties to racist organizations
8487115 if you look at the county bylaws there is no ability to kick him out of his position or the party and my friends in the congress know that and thats why in their letter they talk about how uncertain it is
8487116 i fully agree with the letter that congressmen franks shadegg and flake sent to the maricopa county republican party this week
8487117 we have no room for hate speech or hate groups
8487118 nathan sproul is a target of a federal voter fraud investigation
8487119 and has demonstrated sic to be as credible on politics as mr ready has been on race
8487120 still the best bang for your buck when it comes to chrome

8487123 we looked very hard at how people really browse the web we looked at a lot of data about how people browse and tried a lot of different designs in front of many kinds of people not just technologists
8487124 ie8 takes into account that there are often relationships between new tabs that users open and the browser can make it a lot easier to figure out which tabs go with which
8487125 habr risas habr l grimas y el p blico podr aprender algo acerca de c mo podemos cambiar las consecuencias de esta enfermedad si ponemos nuestras mentes en ello

8487128 you mean that place where they all want to suck john mccains cock ill never enter that place again
8487129 wait a minute youre going to do what let customers choose what they pay you for downloading your latest album
8487130 going into it right away we knew it was going to have more instrumentation
8487131 we added cello violin trombone trumpet a lot of instruments got used on this album working with other musicians there were so many ideas getting thrown around the room
8487132 there was a lot of working until three or four in the morning and waking up at eight in the morning to start all over again
8487133 for some reason my mind does not work in the way that it should i cant remember anything ill write songs on tour and get really stuck in the groove of editing and over working until the song is just garbage i need to just throw something out there and leave it as is use the melodies as they come to me this time around we had so many different people to jam with in the studio that it made it a lot more relaxed
8487134 i feel like if we question it too much well lose it and not be able to figure out how we did it in the first place
8487135 i guess everything before this new album was pretty much sampled in a way
8487136 i would sit down and play guitar and we would copy and paste and we would build songs more like a hip hop producer would do it
8487137 that we made the whole album with a drum machine it was really funny having jason come up and record over top of that stuff because when youre using drum machines you can do such crazy shit there were high hats everywhere and extra snares jason had to deal with a lot
8487138 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8487139 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
8487140 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
8487141 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
8487142 the burden falls almost exclusively on women and those single women who see that happening choose not to marry for now anyway
8487143 for women this has caused enormous change socially and mentally
8487144 guys will allow a woman to express herself but they do not want their position threatened
8487145 i am willing to take care of and give comfort to a man whom i care about but that does not mean i want to be his mother
8487146 i dont know why one would want a child so much
8487147 in japanese culture the point is not to have children but to have ones own children
8487148 there is still a foundation in us japanese women that thinks hunting for a guy is not ladylike
8487149 mccain took sort of an early lead right out of the gate it was kind of obvious to us mccain was going to win because he was so far ahead
8487150 it was very similar to what was happening in the public
8487151 he is fully capable of spending his 99 cents and casting his vote too
8487152 we would welcome his 99 cents just like anyone else
8487153 in addition to the retail properties such as sams wine amp spirits and binnys we also expect to place our premium vodka in the finest restaurants and bars throughout chicago

8487157 the brand name honors our respective ancestors boyd is my business partners late father in law and blair is my great grandfather the two names however also reflect that every bottle we produce is the work of just two guys
8487158 unlike other brands that claim to be handcrafted every bottle of boyd amp blair is made from scratch
8487159 the fact is many small brands actually buy bulk ethanol from other sources not us we make it all right here
8487160 the true benefit of distilling our vodka in small batches is trusting our own taste buds to know we are bottling only the hearts bottling only the hearts gives boyd and blair its smooth taste

8487171 especially the past five six seven years playing on the road on opening day
8487172 i said all through the course of last season that we had to find ways to get him on the field more he gives us great flexibility with him at receiver it gives us a chance to get all of our weapons on the field for every snap
8487173 we dont just call plays when we put an offense together we start with the best players and then place them in formations and then draw up plays it forces you to build a system that puts the most talented guys on the field and then you devise formations and plays to accommodate them
8487174 their offense is completely different than what weve been practicing all spring and summer
8487175 theyll run plays with four and five wide receivers they will spread the field and throw the ball around a lot well probably see a lot of screens so its completely different than what were accustomed to
8487176 and with no preseason games and limited scrimmages the first game is always one of a little uncertainty because of substitutions and special teams
8487177 you dont know what theyre going to do and they dont know what were going to do
8487178 weve got a lot of new wrinkles on both sides of the ball that they havent seen and im sure they have the same thing you make sure you dont get caught up in defending ghosts as they say and you go out there and focus on being sound
8487179 the doctor told me it wouldnt hurt her to walk without it so we tossed it out

8487182 we could have focused on the prophecies and visions because he had many many of those or we could do what we ended up doing which was to talk a little bit about his personal experiences
8487183 five hundred years ago he was going through some tough times
8487184 he was rejected by a lot of people who thought he was dabbling in the black arts
8487185 he also dabbled in alchemy the process of trying to turn base metals into gold he had a kind of metal laboratory working silver and gold and copper so he was a metalhead
8487186 i think i can speak for all of us by saying our goal is not elitism superstardom or to paint an image for ourselves music isnt a fashion statement and it doesnt make you superior to anyone else
8487187 art and music help you feel better about your own life and even on a small scale like this it means a lot to us

8487195 the us navy destroyer uss mcfaul which is currently docked in the georgian port of batumi carries about 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on board they are outfitted with nuclear warheads and are meant to hit ground targets the remaining nato ships are currently concentrated in the northern part of the black sea
8487196 it is strange that such a large group of nato warships has arrived for a joint exercise with bulgaria or romania usually only one or two warships participate in such exercises so the attempts to substantiate the presence of the naval group with a military exercise does not withstand any criticism
8487197 it is clear that all statements made by the political and defense administration of nato members are accompanied with outspoken militarist demarches the use of nuclear weapons by nato ships in the black sea is out of the question the conventional weapons which the nato naval group has in the region are more than enough to achieve any defense goals which can be exemplified with yugoslavia

8487214 a standoff between iraq war veterans and police ended after representatives of barack obamas campaign finally emerged from the pepsi center to hear the groups grievances
8487215 the veterans were arrayed in formation and in uniform marching slowly toward a line of police who had warned them they could be pepper sprayed and arrested
8487216 as the vets got within a few yards of the police the cavalry arrived in the form of two white shirted obama staffers who asked a representative of the veterans to be escorted inside the security zone
8487217 after a brief conversation a veterans representative said they had been promised a meeting with obamas liason for veterans affairs a cheer went up the veterans did an about face and

8487237 the principle is similar to the virtual shoe fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris
8487238 but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t shirts shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about
8487239 to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously
8487240 calculating the spatial parameters of the projected image on the basis of a two dimensional model this reduces the number of dimensions we need to simulate the image and allows us to rapidly evaluate any movements

8487360 we think the price of rice will soften and are cautious about the government entering the market now to buy a big block
8487361 its not a matter of time but price at high prices bernas will make a loss
8487362 checks at the two premises are being conducted as part of investigation so far only the statements of several officers at the ministry and bernas have been recorded
8487363 bernas apologised for importing rice above the permitted quota without referring to the ministry it also given assurances that such a mistake will not be repeated
8487364 in a situation of first come first served bernas placed an order for 16 000 tonnes of rice for last year and an additional 19 000 tonnes for this year although the overall quota for 2008 has yet to be decided
8487365 importing rice is easy but processing it entails much problems what has happened to the conditions imposed on bernas what we see now is that bumiputera owned rice mills have closed down where are they now
8487366 why do we want to be both importing and producing rice which would eventually bring us nothing and people see that bernas is making the profit
8487367 we didnt bother about these people walking across the border these people are not smugglers they are just couriers earning a living if we stop them from earning a living this way then they may resort to other means to make a living like crime
8487368 sometimes we need to take action just to show we are doing our job
8487369 so we tip off the bosses that we will be making a raid that night we then agree that they will abandon one or two lorries for us to confiscate
8487370 once we arrested some of those couriers and guess who came to bail them out
8487371 his family in fact comes from golok and they have many businesses there such as hotels and so on
8487372 how then to take action when the top guns themselves are involved
8487373 if i clamp down i might find myself transferred out of rantau panjang super fast so we just close our eyes and once in awhile stage these successful raids and confiscate a few sacks or rice just to keep everyone quiet
8487374 but these couriers are small time they just carry one sack across the border and how many sacks can they carry in a day its the legal importers who are the big time smugglers they bring rice in by the containers and they can do so because they have import permits
8487375 why should i want to be the menteri besar of perlis

8487377 i told him i am not interested in being the perlis mb i want to do business
8487378 he asked me what business i wanted to do and i told him i wanted to take over the privatisation of bernas
8487379 the pm was puzzled he told me he has offered me the perlis mbs post and i reject the offer other people would jump at the chance
8487380 i told him i am more interested in getting rich
8487381 the pm said he will think about it and get back to me later a few days later the pm told me that he will agree to me taking over bernas if i agree to become the mb
8487382 i asked the pm how is this possible the pm replied to leave that to him he will clear it with the cabinet he will explain to the cabinet that the bernas deal is part of the terms for me accepting the mbs post
8487383 once i saw what they were going to do i decided to quit
8487384 i saw the move to privatise lpn as just one more move to make some people rich and i wanted nothing to do with it
8487385 i spent practically my entire working life serving lpn our only mission in life was to serve the rice farmers and ensure that their welfare was well taken care of but what they wanted to do to lpn is criminal so i just left in disgust
8487386 its not only what they wanted to do that was so wrong it is also the people who were behind the whole exercise that was not right
8487387 i personally know shahidan so i know what type of person he is he is just out to make money and he was going to do so at the welfare of the rice farmers
8487388 for example for the year 2000 an estimated 9 or almost 16 000 rice farmers have incomes below the poverty level
8487389 the estimated annual average net income from rice cultivation in peninsula malaysia for that same year ranged from rm1 500 or rm125 per month in areas like telok intan kelantan and terengganu to rm6 000 or rm500 per month in advanced areas like mada
8487390 how does one support a family with that low income level
8487391 it is time the truth is revealed and malaysians are made aware of the exploitation the rice farmers are being subjected to
8487392 at the moment there is no rice subsidy but that will come in the future
8487393 we can at least assure the lower income group that local rice will be made available to them at affordable prices
8487394 we have to see changes in lifestyle among malaysians to accommodate this economic situation
8487395 our priority now is to concentrate on the immediate term there is a need for the use of more fertilisers and we need to buy farming equipment to increase yields and productivity
8487396 all the types of rice i am familiar with have gone up since last week it is hurting my pocket
8487397 sehubungan itu peningkatan harga di peringkat pengguna pula tidak dapat dielakkan

8487423 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
8487424 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given

8487446 we proudly cast 26 votes for the next president of the united states senator barack obama and one vote for hillary clinton

8487449 and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8487450 i think he came here tonight with a very strong message pleasing to hear that from a great president
8487451 this morning before my children went to school it was very difficult because they knew that he may not be coming home this afternoon
8487452 he has been forever been exposed to the world as something that we shun that is a horrible experience to undergo
8487453 id like to say sorry to the city to the public for what i did id like to apologize to my family for making shame on the hamasaki name but especially to my kids when i seen them this morning not knowing whether i would come home or not telling them goodbye
8487454 the court has a strong opportunity to send a message that public servants are supposed to serve the public interest not their own self interest and a term of imprisonment will do that
8487455 it sends a terrible message to the community that the courts are not treating public corruption seriously so in our view this sentence sent absolutely to the community

8487459 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war

8487474 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8487475 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen

8487491 one that includes several types of schools including denominational schools
8487492 these are highly emotive terms which are insulting to parents and should have no place in irish public debate
8487493 is it possible never mind desirable to have in every city town and village different types of schools that reflect the individual wishes of each and every subset of parents
8487494 already it is clear that attempts thus far to provide for a limited amount of faith and linguistic diversity are directly responsible for many children being educated in substandard school conditions
8487495 attempts have been made to portray the into as against denominational schools when the reality is that teachers have indicated in several surveys their support for religious education in schools
8487496 it is not a case of trying to drive religion out of schools neither is it a case of trying to build a one size fits all model
8487497 we had a little more a year ago than now but not considerably more weve done some tweaking but the values have gone down tremendously
8487498 when different ones pop up on the radar screen we pay particular attention theres no mass selloff or anything like that going on

8487500 right in the middle of the pack with other public funds
8487501 i just think its helpful to recognize the magnitude of these funds and their long investment horizons
8487502 these funds are long term investors who are out there looking for opportunities
8487503 we are continuing to monitor and working with our manager to identify what is the best course for the fund
8487504 with our long view and diversification we generally have low volatility built into our portfolio there are going to be ups and downs in the market and we believe we are prepared to weather these financial challenges in our overall portfolio

8487510 theres a need in the market for contemporary music that has a christian following and understanding and especially that youth leaders guardians and teens feel good about coming too
8487511 it sounds a lot like mainstream music but has important messages that youth and adults can benefit from
8487512 i feel like ive just always wanted to wear my emotions on my sleeve and my heart on my sleeve so that people who go through trials can relate
8487513 everybody goes through hardships all my songs arent just about hardships and trials but its about just taking action and taking stands for things
8487514 it is human nature to be attracted to anything that makes you go
8487515 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8487516 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8487517 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8487518 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
8487519 the officer involved had parked his unmarked car at his home and left his pistol and badges inside the vehicle
8487520 the id card is laminated so its possible somebody could remove the lamination and put another picture on it
8487521 you hear stories about people going around impersonating police officers and getting this type of equipment is something they probably would use
8487522 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8487523 rove is pushing romney so aggressively some folks are beginning to wonder whats going on
8487524 romney is already vetted by the media has strong executive experience both in business and in government has an interesting story to tell with saving the u s olympics and also helps mccain deal with the economy because he can speak to the economy with a fluency that mccain doesnt have
8487525 we didnt have proper portfolio management i wasnt sure how the department decided what to do and what not to do
8487526 we have begun the process of engagement and understanding the business need to structure our service operations and ensure there is ongoing discussion between the business and it to ensure were properly aligned
8487527 when i came into defence and thought we get a fair bit of money what do we spend it on but it was very hard to track it all down
8487528 at least within my group we now have a work plan that shows what it is were allocating resources to
8487529 we were working with something like 130 different vendors in the infrastructure space and 350 in the application space
8487530 it wasnt possible for us to have proper engagement and understand what we were about and build a relationship
8487531 theres no point putting out bundles of services we need to understand the markets position and how we bundle services
8487532 this isnt a philosophical debate around whether nothing should be outsourced or everything should be outsourced
8487533 we need to make a decision based our value proposition there are some things that wed probably never outsource
8487534 they were quite low level problems but fundamental to having any further discussion and engagement
8487535 that means that some 80 women per day have exercised their controversial right
8487536 well go out there try to play well put some points on the board and were just trying to fine tune for the opener
8487537 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8487538 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8487539 some of them are playing for a spot on the team some of them are playing to expand their roles
8487540 uh yes does that come with a side of pillage or plunder

8487542 the terrifying part is when the wave breaks and it starts to chase you
8487543 best day of surfing at aileens in the last two years days like the day we had out there are very rare
8487544 the worlds surf community knows about aileens now and it is doing great things for surfing in lahinch and
8487545 but the beauty of it is on the day when we were surfing it there were really only six or seven of us actually riding the wave
8487546 the last few weeks have proved to be a testing and uncertain time for all employed at the club
8487547 it is our fervent hope that the club will emerge from these difficulties and we will all do everything in our power to assist in this
8487548 at this point we once again appeal to our loyal fans whose support over the past few weeks has been absolutely magnificent and the people of cork to get behind the club in the coming weeks
8487549 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back

8487552 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8487553 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8487554 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8487555 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8487556 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8487557 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8487558 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8487559 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8487560 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8487561 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8487562 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8487563 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8487564 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8487565 we have a dj who plays music and there are disco lights and we play games such as limbo and racing games like green light go
8487566 parents can feel comfortable leaving their children here so you can either come with your family or drop your kids off and go off and go do something else
8487567 its kind of like revenge of the nerds but were not really nerds
8487568 we just dont really care that much my character is pregnant so i really dont feel like doing anything
8487569 im not going to say this business is easy because its not but im definitely grateful that im a part of it if thats because of idol then thats because of idol im not afraid to look back to where i got my start

8487572 i love working with my stargate family it was my first big job and its been going on for a dozen years now and it still goes on
8487573 i have to teach people what i know worked for me im responsible but what they poured into me how they blessed my life the older generation now that im a part of the older generation its my responsibility to pour into the generation thats come after me
8487574 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value
8487575 they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for im fired up about firing up young people to understand their power and their worth
8487576 well also have a childrens area in the park so at 6 p m we can take down the childrens area on the terrace level to accommodate a larger crowd at the state street stage
8487577 i think what happens is people get there and they automatically go to the upper stage because its crown center and thats where you go
8487578 but the other stage is just as big and the sound is just as powerful and with the city as a backdrop its a real pretty stage
8487579 we were sure given the economic climate that travel would go down but were now about 300 close to 400 rooms up from last year
8487580 because crown center owns the westin and the hyatt they are our sponsor hotels so we do blocks of rooms through them were close to 2 000 rooms sold for the irish fest block and last year we did around 1 600 to 1 700 so thats our best estimate of what were looking at this year
8487581 our online presale is only about 60 tickets no one buys until the week of we sell like 50 000 worth online so its all the week of its the nature of the buyer plus everyone staying in the hotels gets two tickets per night
8487582 its a little difficult to get them up there and to clean them
8487583 but we found a guy who will work with us a lot of the congestion last year came from people going downstairs to go to the restroom this should reduce some of the traffic in the lower level
8487584 more of a living history area than just a display

8487588 im interested in how people anthropomorphise things how quickly we can talk about something as if its alive
8487589 im really more interested in peoples reaction to the work than expressing myself through them
8487590 its interesting what people inadvertently reveal about themselves when faced with a soft toy some people are cuddlers some arent
8487591 this one guy kept going on about how i should never go and talk to a psychologist but then he still bought one for his unborn child
8487592 its for modern more edgy stuff that doesnt fit into a traditional craft fair
8487593 i dont think my work necessarily fits into sustainable living as i dont always use found or recycled materials although i can fully appreciate the issue
8487594 i see the comeback of craft as part of the way people deal with our increasingly technological world people are always wary of new things and tend to go back to what is familiar and trusted i like the idea that there is room for both
8487595 i think some of us just have an unexplainable desire to make things
8487596 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8487597 we had been in japan for almost a year and were just put on local tv
8487598 not only that we were still using mostly home grown czw guys and the locker room was never tighter czw truly had a family atmosphere from the wrestlers to ring crew to the security guys and even the fans the reception that lord everett devore got showed that czw fans had developed their own unique personality
8487599 every time we had a show at that firehouse they got nervous and didnt realize what a czw show was
8487600 i have no idea why they kept having us back
8487601 we were setting the pace for all the other companies to do what they do
8487602 they were the best times i had in czw those were the guys i was hanging out with in japan and then i also got to work with them back home
8487603 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8487604 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen the facts obama did none of this single handedly but as a member of the childrens health insurance program he also helped pass legislation to raise the income threshold for eligibility and make the temporary program permanent john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8487605 minnesota renewable energy leaders take al franken to task on renewable energy laws
8487606 al frankens criticism of senator colemans strong leadership in passing the 2005 energy bill is disappointing to all of us who put everything we had into passing that bill into law
8487607 the 2005 energy bill was a dream come true for tens of thousands of minnesotans
8487608 as anyone involved in the renewable energy discussion knows the passage of the 2005 energy bill was critically important to our energy independence
8487609 al franken is simply wrong on the facts and wrong on his understanding of the importance of the 2005 energy bill his continued opposition to this bill as nothing more than a big oil bill is not honest with the facts or fair to any of us who so strongly supported this legislation its also not being truthful with the people of minnesota
8487610 without that energy bill which was supported by 74 senators democrats and republicans alike including senator barack obama we would not have the first ever renewable fuels standard a first ever biodiesel tax credit or critical tax credits for wind energy small ethanol producers or e 85
8487611 we would not have critical incentives to create energy from clean coal and nuclear power that help control power costs for our homes and businesses and we would not have many of the conservation measures that that bill put in place
8487612 the 2005 energy bill really got things started in the right direction before this bill many involved in renewable energy were struggling to survive
8487613 we have senator coleman to thank for all that we have been able to accomplish as result of his support for renewable energy and the 2005 energy bill
8487614 coleman spokesman friedrich said franken doesnt offer much in the way of new proposals and that colman has consistently supported efforts to support renewable energy sen coleman co authored and helped pass the first ever renewable fuels standard as part of the 2005 energy bill which spurred the current ethanol and biofuels boom in minnesota friedrich said the 2005 major energy bill included some important provisions but franken said he would have still voted against it it gave billions of dollars of tax subsidies to the oil companies but it did promote ethanol so it would have been a tough vote

8487631 because those guys got it together michael bisping took to me like a brother from the first time i met him he and anthony were very hospitable towards me when i first came to the uk

8487682 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8487683 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor
8487684 she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible when faced with moments of fatigue laziness or weakness one had only to ask what would del and phyllis do while she will be greatly missed her legacy will be cherished forever
8487685 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8487686 i also never imagined there would be day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed

8487697 up to now we have obtained 4 3 billion dollars
8487698 in the last several years and years that ive been doing the study you could see that indian gaming has had very healthy growth its continually outdone commercial gaming
8487699 that continued to be true this year but indian gaming had slower growth in 2007 and this is actually the third year in a row of slower growth
8487700 it was about 15 percent growth in 2005 in 2006 it was 10 percent and now its only 5 percent
8487701 but while i think its part of that i think there is a more pervasive reason why indian gaming has been slowing down at least in the last couple years
8487702 by limiting the supply i mean not allowing tribes to have certain types of games or not allowing them to have more games
8487703 what im seeing is the tribes developing their facilities and wanting to do more but theyre not allowed to even tribes where they try to renegotiate with the states or try to get more machines in certain places the state just refuses to negotiate with them and wont give them more
8487704 the fact is that the tribes that are all renegotiating these compacts are trying to get an increase in supply why not because they dont need it theyre doing it because they do need it in california theres going to be a huge increase in the revenue sharing the tribes are willing to pay to do this they dont do that lightly
8487705 there are some of these states where there seems to be limitations on supply but yet the demand is there california for sure washington arizona even some smaller states like south dakota and montana are examples where there seems to be demand greater than supply
8487706 so i think that what ive seen happening is a slowdown but its sort of an artificial slowdown its not all because of the economy its not because the markets saturated theres no more players or they dont want to play its in some ways because you can only do so much with what youve got
8487707 i think the slowdown is likely to continue a bit more until the economy recovers which is going to happen this is the way the economy is up down it will pick up it will eventually turn around
8487708 when it does and when the tribes get the consumer confidence back and theyre able to develop their facilities to fulfill the maximum potential of their compacts youre going to see some good sizable growth youre going to see indian gaming rebound and youre going to see some stronger numbers back to where they had been before this past year
8487709 to come on line and add a new facility is increasing the supply and meeting some unmet demand
8487710 if you offer them non gaming amenities you get people to come from farther distances they stay longer and they spend more money

8487740 although there is a risk of vitamin d deficiency it is always far better to exclusively breastfeed babies through six months and partial breastfeed through at least a year and deal potential vitamin d deficiency through regular exposure to the sun a balanced diet on the part of the mother and supplementation either of mother or infant depending on situation than to not breastfeed due to potential vitamin d deficiency
8487741 i thought i was doing the best thing for her
8487742 i completely support breast feeding and i think breast milk is the perfect food and the healthiest way to nourish an infant however were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up they may start their lives vitamin d deficient and then all theyre getting is vitamin d deficient breast milk

8487755 we have not decided on appointing the fund manager and the cra and we are considering alternatives to joining the centres infrastructure
8487756 these costs would be paid by the government and not the employees as a proportion of the lifetime accumulations the cra fees may not add up to more than 10 basis points the cra is the nerve centre of the nps and there are capital costs for setting up the network software et al
8487757 if the number of mployees goes over 10 lakh nsdl will charge rs 280 if it crosses 15 lakh the costs will drop to rs 210
8487758 there are two main issues which are a matter of concern for us first we feel the costs given by the cra for record keeping is very high second we also have doubts about the logistics to be provided by nsdl we are unsure whether it would be able to implement the scheme in the state down to the tehsil level
8487759 the agreement with the cra has been given a final shape we are also in the process of finalizing pacts with the nps banker and the nps trust
8487760 we did not feel the need to quibble over the costs as the number of our employees under the scheme is too small we also do not have the kind of experience and architecture in the pf and the pension sector that rajasthan has so we had to accept the costing and the central architecture
8487761 the cost of maintaining the records has been an issue with most states and it has also been raised many times with the pfrda but since there is not much option we have to accept their pricing structure but we hope that as the years pass by and more employees join the scheme the rates will go down we will also raise this issue later on next year

8487803 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8487804 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8487805 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8487806 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8487807 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8487849 that was a strange circumstance because it wasnt an evacuation in advance of a hurricane it was an evacuation after the floods it was a humanitarian effort

8487886 according to the campaign media analysis group which monitors political advertising across the country only one of the three clinton themed ads has been broadcast so far and that ad featuring a clinton delegate who now endorses mccain is only airing in toledo ohio
8487887 if we want to point out how misleading they are we air the ad mccains campaign wins the point if refuse to point out how misleading they are mccains campaign escapes criticism

8487943 the ministers were confident that the asean china fta free trade area remains a regional trading arrangement of some global significance given the magnitude of trade between the parties which accounted for 13 7 percent of global trade or almost half of asias total trade in 2007

8487962 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8487963 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8487964 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8487965 for some time now the opc has been calling for national legislation to ban junk food advertising at peak times when children are actually watching television and to substantially restrict all other forms of promotion of unhealthy food to children and adolescents
8487966 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8487967 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8487968 we didnt have proper portfolio management i wasnt sure how the department decided what to do and what not to do
8487969 we have begun the process of engagement and understanding the business need to structure our service operations and ensure there is ongoing discussion between the business and it to ensure were properly aligned
8487970 when i came into defence and thought we get a fair bit of money what do we spend it on but it was very hard to track it all down
8487971 at least within my group we now have a work plan that shows what it is were allocating resources to
8487972 we were working with something like 130 different vendors in the infrastructure space and 350 in the application space
8487973 it wasnt possible for us to have proper engagement and understand what we were about and build a relationship
8487974 theres no point putting out bundles of services we need to understand the markets position and how we bundle services
8487975 this isnt a philosophical debate around whether nothing should be outsourced or everything should be outsourced
8487976 we need to make a decision based our value proposition there are some things that wed probably never outsource
8487977 they were quite low level problems but fundamental to having any further discussion and engagement

8487985 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8487986 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8487987 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8487988 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible

8487993 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8487994 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8487995 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum
8487996 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock
8487997 why is it propitious today not only because of the intertwining of the mission of free press founder teodoro locsin sr and my father but also because this year the life of the carp law will last in december and once again i count on a locsin in congress and locsin in the free press to champion its extension
8487998 i hope that we can work together as your father and my father did with the extension of land reform with reforms that will really emancipate and empower the farmers to be agri business persons
8487999 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8488000 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilize they said all the web sites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8488001 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8488002 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8488048 over the years whether it be our own people here at duke obviously our opponents people in the media they expect you to be perfect
8488049 they dont look at process any more its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win a national championship
8488050 you know very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot and so part of that becomes where you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8488051 for the rest of my career im not going with that relief thing
8488052 we all get tired but theres good tired and bad tired
8488053 ive said a lot it was like being in a coaches clinic the last three summers
8488054 there are so many ideas there are so many times we sat with the whole staff exchanging ideas exchanging philosophies
8488055 and i think even so last year with our duke team there were things we tinkered with that were a little bit different here or there and well even add more things that coaches on our staff did but also the things you learn from the different countries you know its a different game and different ideas and different ways and different things and different plays
8488056 i learned a lot in the three years ive been doing this
8488057 i think im a better coach i know im a better coach after going through this theres no question about that
8488058 and i have a great understanding i think of the international game right now of how many good players there are how many good coaches there are
8488059 and for our whole staff to be there and be together and talk basketball you know in a normal situation its not like that in the normal summers
8488060 im using an hd dvr provided by my cable company and most times it works well enough
8488061 while our circulation in context continues to be acceptable advertising revenues are awful
8488062 the chicago sun times had the best sports section in the city before jay mariotti came to town thats why he signed up with us and his departure does not change that
8488063 the esa foundation is committed to helping improve the lives of young people
8488064 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8488065 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8488066 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8488067 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8488068 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8488069 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8488070 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8488071 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8488072 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8488073 what is needed is an ending of premature and involuntary retirement and greater recognition and utilisation of older peoples skills and knowledge
8488074 such developments will allow older people to contribute more significantly to society
8488075 older people make a significant contribution to our communities adding cultural richness as well as sharing a wealth of experience knowledge and skills
8488076 they contribute in many areas from employment to volunteering from providing care to being custodians of our history
8488077 its great to know that ive been here since day one
8488078 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8488079 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8488080 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me
8488081 i came back to replace the experience that was lost when awen guttenbeil and sione faumuina left
8488082 ive played how i wanted so it s been a successful second stint in my eyes
8488083 achieving the top eight and making the playoffs at the end of the year are always fond memories
8488084 to be involved in it for a number of seasons has been fantastic because making the final series is always a huge thing
8488085 im looking to play one more season in the uk i wouldnt be able to play in the nrl for another team
8488086 if it doesnt work out in the right way for me i may look at hanging up the boots at the end of the year but ill know more over the next few weeks
8488087 today new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8488088 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8488089 among rich developed nations only iceland has a higher level of national debt on such a measure
8488090 what we are seeing through kiwisaver is nothing short of a savings revolution in this country
8488091 podemos ver los rollos con un detalle con el que no se han visto antes
8488092 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8488093 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8488094 president clinton is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure senator obama is the next president of the united states
8488095 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8488096 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8488097 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8488098 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8488099 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8488100 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8488101 now he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8488102 we took a sample and discovered 80 employees had filed approximately 170 claims
8488103 thats an average of two or more claims per employee that seems very excessive
8488104 its not always wise to start someone in that situation when the games very intense
8488105 but to come off the bench hed be pretty good the two strikers were probably the two outstanding players last week
8488106 its important we find out exactly where were at at this stage of the season
8488107 theyve changed their formation virtually every game ive seen them play in the pre season and the first two rounds
8488108 i would say garys either trying to change a couple of things so all we can do is focus on what we do well
8488109 weve gone six games undefeated its our first home game so we have to play to our strengths
8488110 we have adopted action selling as part of our culture with tremendous success

8488118 neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine as such appears in the new testament nor did jesus and his followers intend to contradict the shema in the old testament hear o israel the lord our god is one lord deuteronomy 6 4
8488119 history has shown that experience has little to do with being a good president
8488120 i know my history both gw and reagan served as governors however thats vastly different than being president i my view the only experience that counts as president is being president
8488121 urge d all texans to answer the call to serve those in need
8488122 when i was told about my role sanjay was clear cut and told me at the outset itself that some scenes needed me to wear a bikini and that too a white one
8488123 i essay the role of this hep girl the kind whod slip on a bikini when it came to swimming i had no reservations about wearing a two piece swimsuit
8488124 i did the usual dieting gymming routine to get a bod for the bikini
8488125 the toughest part was finding a stark white bikini normally they are in fluorescent colours or bright hues but my designer shilpa bhatia who has styled me for the film managed to find one we shot the scenes in mauritius
8488126 buss er allerede raskere enn toget p enkelte strekninger som mellom arendal og oslo
8488127 videre oppgradering av e18 og e39 mellom oslo og stavanger vil s rge for enda raskere busser behovet for jernbane mellom kongsberg og egersund og larvik skien blir da sv rt lite
8488128 all persontrafikk p strekningen kongsberg kristiansand vil f plass med n ekstra buss i timen i hver retning
8488129 jernbanens kapasitet for gods fra buskerud til rogaland er sprengt f rre persontog gir plass til flere godstog
8488130 fartsgrensen p motorvei b r kes til 100 kilometer i timen for buss slik at bussene kan kj re like fort som personbilene
8488131 holdeplassene b r oppgraderes og plasseres slik at bussturen blir mest mulig effektiv
8488132 ved mer enn en dobling av bussfrekvensen kan det bli langt mer interessante reise med bussen fordi ventetiden alltid vil v re kort

8488141 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
8488142 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
8488143 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
8488144 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
8488145 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something

8488151 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
8488152 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
8488153 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
8488154 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house

8488157 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
8488158 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
8488159 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
8488160 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
8488161 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
8488162 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
8488163 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol

8488172 it is mits very good fortune that you decided to join us
8488173 what you bring to mit is partly individual your own intellect energy ideas and aspirations your distinctive life experience and point of view
8488174 in addition to each of your individual gifts together you represent the start of a marvelous new chapter in the history of human understanding and it happens that weve gathered in an unusually interesting place to think about that idea
8488175 complete disregard for the accepted boundaries between different fields of knowledge
8488176 today we dress up that attitude with the awkward phrase multidisciplinary thinking but for da vinci it was nothing more than his ravenous curiosity his desire to explore everything to explain everything and to put to use everything he learned
8488177 a place of practical optimism and of passionate engagement with the most important problems of the world
8488178 it is a place that is not satisfied until we find the deepest answers
8488179 your journey here will require you to be your own agent in your education
8488180 rest assured you can and will succeed here although you may work harder than you ever have before
8488181 because if you want to solve a problem you dont have to find a problem that exists you can find your own problem thats what defines mit
8488182 after hearing the speeches im feeling a little more invigorated i really want to research and work with professors and i really like how they focused their speeches on that concept
8488183 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8488184 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8488185 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8488186 silliest moves it would now oppose the whole bill in the senate
8488187 family to lineal descendants children and grandchildren for certain tax purposes
8488188 de facto inheritance tax at the top marginal rate that would create complicated hurdles for small business and farming families and provide money for lawyers and advisers
8488189 we have had over the last almost two weeks now varying reports of the illness
8488190 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some a hole with a blog
8488191 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8488192 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line
8488193 duff mckagan sold more than 90 million albums between 1987 and 1993
8488194 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8488195 the light of day needs to be shone onto the activities of the sect
8488196 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
8488197 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
8488198 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
8488199 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
8488200 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
8488201 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
8488202 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
8488203 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
8488204 ah mulher q faz essas coisas de p merece respeito se eu fizer isso c ele ele vai achar q eu sou o tipo p casar
8488205 if associates get all the benefits of training at my law firm in the first three years and cant really add much value anyway why dont they pay us
8488206 i was deciding do i want to have another baby do i want to have an affair or go back to school thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8488207 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8488208 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8488209 por su bistur han pasado presidentes gobernadores ministros jueces y jerarcas de la iglesia y con exacta frialdad l los ha descuartizado los ha hecho todo tipo de operaciones les agrand la cabeza les achic el cuerpo les reban el cerebro y para sorpresa de todos todos siguen vivos
8488210 even though the military action is simply an extension of diplomacy by other means and the military is sent to fight by the same government that represents those civilians it is only okay to kill the guys in the funny green suits you cant kill the civilians they are protected
8488211 it is good that war is so horrible lest we become too fond of it
8488212 what baron wants to see happen is his bill enacted to put back regulations that were taken out in 2000
8488213 that roll call today just brought us all to tears
8488214 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8488215 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8488216 kerrys speech was surely the best he ever had bill clintons speech was very uplifting and very helpful to the democratic party i hope that all of hillarys supporters all will be fully supportive of barack
8488217 so many big speakers made it so then we got this great surprise for dessert
8488218 the fact that i had done something recent really helped
8488219 it was the same way with ronald reagan in the last few years he was president
8488220 john mccain an honorable man but is he the right republican for the future
8488221 mccain opposes repeal of the death tax and voted against the bush tax cuts twice mccain pushed to let every illegal immigrant stay here permanently even voted to allow illegals to collect social security and mitt romney mitt romney cut taxes and spending as governor he opposes amnesty for illegals mitt romney john mccain there is a difference
8488222 youre the republican candidate for president and you want to fix the countrys problems even though you dont know much about the economy you dont know how to use the internet you dont know how many houses you own or what kind of car you drive you admit you dont think clearly when you re tired you make frequent gaffes on foreign policy you think offshore drilling is a short term solution to high gas prices you support torture and keeping the guantanamo prison open you make rash decisions and statements from which you have to quickly backtrack you have an explosive temper on a hair trigger your idea of health care reform is wear more sunscreen youre for stem cell research except when its done on stem cells because you consider them all american citizens and you voted to support the policies of the worst president ever 100 percent of the time this year
8488223 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
8488224 a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is formidable for he is known and carries his banners openly against the city but the traitor moves among those within the gates freely his sly whispers rustling through the alley and heard in the very halls of government itself he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist
8488225 excuse me senator but how in gods name could that not be an attack on his patriotism
8488226 leahy yet another slimey dem lawyer the repubs have successful business men and war heroes and the dems have sleazey lawyers
8488227 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine hes erratic hes hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8488228 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind that should disqualify him
8488229 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic
8488230 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
8488231 he is a vicious person they so disliked him that they wouldnt support him
8488232 what happens if he gets angry in crisis in the presidency its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i just dont see that he has that quality
8488233 john mccain is bob dole minus the charm conservatism and youth
8488234 hardheaded is one way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs me
8488235 it just seems like everything we did john was someplace else in my mind he is not a conservative
8488236 he is the anti conservative he instinctively sides against conservatives and relishes poking them in the eye
8488237 agreed the negative bounce phenomena will get even more pronounced after obamas speechifying in front of pubescent swooning and fainting in lust college girls on thursday night
8488238 no im a regular guy with a regular wife and kids
8488239 if mccain was mixing up sunnis with potatoes you might have a point otherwise youre just using this as a bs talking point to further your own agenda
8488240 carol mccain i had 23 operations i am five inches shorter than i used to be and i was in hospital for six months
8488241 mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory
8488242 president biden and barack america will do right by the folks in all 57 states as well as our fallen heroes in the audience
8488243 agreed the negative bounce phenomena will get even more pronounced after obamas speechifying in front of pubescent swooning and fainting in lust college girls on thursday night
8488244 no im a regular guy with a regular wife and kids
8488245 i dont know about alzheimers but mccain clearly suffers from dementia
8488246 well when i was a pow i didnt have even one house

8488259 a big mug of coffee zoning out for about 30 minutes or so and then filling out my tps reports
8488260 this will lead to discussions to recognise the independence of chechnya and dagestan
8488261 due to this military conflict the reasons for a boycott are now more than ever
8488262 in my era i built good relations with both russia and the us but this balance has crumbled
8488263 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8488264 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8488265 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8488266 canadian forces have done a remarkable job there they have been in the thick of the fight and they have suffered
8488267 that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bush and the administration they have been preoccupied with iraq
8488268 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
8488269 so remember when we choose a commander in chief this november we are electing judgment and character not years in the senate or years on this earth
8488270 how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself

8488499 david tennant is already gaining a huge following and this will make him really hot property
8488500 this is one of several initiatives taken by the owners to incorporate energy saving and sustainable technologies into the redevelopment plans
8488501 ive given you five minutes i moved you up early
8488502 ive noticed more fish over the years with numbers in the thousands
8488503 in one area we found only five species in 2001 with 75 percent being nonnative
8488504 and removes 9 000 pounds of metal a day and neutralizes about 15 000 pounds of acid a day
8488505 each time they call me the pharmacy calls me or the police department calls me i always tell them one thing pursue the patient and arrest them
8488506 were absolutely sitting on the edge of a cliff hoping
8488507 as we understand it we are the no 1 choice
8488508 we feel very comfortable in this companys interest in us
8488509 this company was looking for rail air water and highway access
8488510 there are products in the market that are positioned as dual band that allow access to only one band at a time or lose transmission speeds when both bands are in use
8488511 the linksys by cisco wrt610n is a dual n band broadband router that is designed to support simultaneous separate wireless n radio bands as we foresee consumers starting to use the 5ghz spectrum for their multimedia devices it becomes more important to have access to the full capabilities of both bands
8488512 wed have to go much further down the road to understand what the cost and schedule for each option truly is
8488513 thats way too far down the road to even think about
8488514 to my recollection nobody has filed to reinstate a construction permit
8488515 the nrc staff will have to make a decision as to whether or not the construction permits can be reinstated or whether or not the process would have to start all over again
8488516 what opportunities the public would be provided to participate in any construction permit reinstatement
8488517 the primary thing is that the nrc stopped inspecting at bellefonte after the construction permits were withdrawn
8488518 while the reactors were mothballed as you might say the nrc would inspect them at least on an annual basis to see that they were being adequately maintained
8488519 we are assessing the impact to the unit 3 amp 4 combined license application that assumed that units 1 and 2 had been cancelled
8488520 its an important decision because a lot of the things that flow downstream from that
8488521 first and foremost we do feel like we need baseload generation about every 5 to 7 years
8488522 our thinking is nuclear is the best product to put out there into the future

8488535 strategically weve been talking about this for quite some time
8488536 it started last year and they have an unbelievable season planned were starting certainly with the resolution of the cliffhanger jorja fox is coming back weve got an unbelievable i call it the dvr proof season of csi
8488537 i dont think you replace billy but you sort of look at adding elements to the show that are really going to invigorate and contribute to the sort of the alchemy of the show where it is today
8488538 theyve created a great character hes a doctor a scientist whos got a very interesting dna that is going to inform the duality of the character so i think there like i said its not necessarily replacing billy but its adding an element that is going to sort of inform the dynamic of the team today
8488539 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey and and to discover who his true character will ultimately become
8488540 we never met with him but we had talked about him
8488541 certainly you like at someone like john malkovich who is an extraordinary actor and who has got a very interesting sort of internal life to every character he does and were looking for someone who has depth and scope and gravitas
8488542 he was amazing so certainly a name that had been talked about as well
8488543 w ith csi its such a great time for that show in that youve also added lauren lee smith who is a terrific young actress who comes in as a new csi and this new character is also going to give to the other supporting characters and marg an opportunity to sort of show parts of their character show parts of their personality that the audiences perhaps havent seen ever before or at least in a while so i think it will be a great transition i promise you
8488544 i mentioned it to my mother one day while i was in college and she said she thought it was a pretty good idea
8488545 i was close to finishing school so she wanted me to complete that so i would have something to fall back on
8488546 chicago is such a blue collar middle american city its just real people you know nobody has an agenda that fits into yours i get recognized and stuff but they dont give a shit about that they just want to know whether or not youre going to buy them a beer
8488547 its a dream and a joy to work with william petersen he is funny he is very smart and he is wild
8488548 william petersen is maybe one of my all time heroes
8488549 billy is very enigmatic one day you think you know him then the next day you realize you dont
8488550 i add things to scenes so does everybody we get it from billy billy is the king of adding things to scenes hes a great guy
8488551 i thought if bill petersen can hang lights who am i to think im above doing that
8488552 i tell my students dont say no to anything thats reasonable even terrible projects are a learning experience
8488553 this is the best day job ive ever had whats even more exciting is that when a show goes to the top you become a part of the pop culture landscape your character becomes an icon a role model it is very special to me that women of all ages find me inspiring because i play someone strong and smart who doesnt have to squander her femininity in the workplace
8488554 im more willing to sit back and let things come to me but this business is too competitive and one has got to be more aggressive and go for things those are the ones that succeed talent is such a small fraction of what makes a successful movie star because its so much about other things drive and passion in whatever you want to be
8488555 once i come home i need to compensate or overcompensate for the time ive spent away but then again im catholic
8488556 catherines relationship with grissom somebody described this to me they have this incredible chemistry without them doing
8488557 i either play cops or criminals im either on the right side of the law or the wrong side
8488558 life will always be good as long as madonna is around i dont think of her as a guilty pleasure anymore shes an outright pleasure
8488559 i thought she was the most beautiful woman id ever seen and really talented
8488560 shes great with the crew she makes everybody feel comfortable theres no diva thing going on the best thing about marg is that she gets all my jokes so of course i am completely endeared to her
8488561 marg is one of the strongest and toughest women ive ever met shes a badass
8488562 marg marg is awesome i love her i love being around her
8488563 shes drop dead gorgeous and shes got something going on underneath shes got a bit of the devil inside her shes a rock and roll chick from the midwest with a ribald sense of humor she cracked me up the whole time we were shooting
8488564 she has a kinda punk thing to her a rock n roll edge but shes really a family girl
8488565 i have always been a huge fan of margs and really like working with her it seems like a lot of the fans have picked up on our chemistry together and that puts a big ole smile on my face played in a golf tournament breast cancer fund raiser she hosts with her hubby alan rosenberg the current sag president up in omaha it was a great experience met her mom andddd my team came in second place rock on
8488566 two specials in america with a u s setting and u s assistant will take it to another level
8488567 david tennant is already gaining a huge following and this will make him really hot property
8488568 the british pound is trading strong against the american dollar which means doing business including filming is much cheaper to do in the united states than it is in england
8488569 has the best track record of any contemporary movie actor none of todays media favorites clooney pitt depp damon can list so many films as good as transporter cellular transporter 2 london revolver crank war and death race
8488570 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist
8488571 get a glass from a cupboard in her kitchen and the whole piece of furniture fell off the wall on top of her cutting her temple and hitting her in the left eye
8488572 as just another sexed up youth oriented product to step off the tv drama assembly line
8488573 90210 and the teen dramas before it starting with the shows sophisticated use of point of view
8488574 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
8488575 when i first found out what a show runner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
8488576 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
8488577 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
8488578 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
8488579 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
8488580 there was nothing that had that beautiful romantic woody allen version of new york
8488581 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
8488582 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes
8488583 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved
8488584 do i wish we got better broadcast ratings yes i wish they gave us more money to make the show
8488585 for us its about how did you matter do people care and do they pay attention to what youre doing i think the show is really succeeding in terms of getting people excited and giving them something to talk about
8488586 it was a huge confidence builder to stand in front of 34 21 year olds and explain something to them every day
8488587 to be in a room and have to explain your point of view is a huge skill in hollywood
8488588 we used to tease her about it she is so thorough and creative and has a wonderful determination to see every aspect of a job through
8488589 that company needed a full time leader to manage personnel and chart a course for its future
8488590 there was no way i could do that job justice and also focus on growing as a writer
8488591 its going to focus on putting people both friend wise and romance wise with people you wouldnt necessarily expect
8488592 watching these relationships develop will be very satisfying for the audience
8488593 her rep felt the seventeen photo looked nothing like blake
8488594 its pretty close quarters in fact one time i ruined a tire by hitting a curb so it can be very treacherous
8488595 if a car breaks down around a bend with no overhead lighting it could cause a fatality
8488596 its very difficult to see people seem to be having trouble maintaining their lanes or even finding a lane
8488597 when it comes to public safety you spend the money you dont want people killed
8488598 i occasionally sleep on campus if i know its safe
8488599 i have an hour in between classes on wednesdays so this is one of the better spots to sleep
8488600 we hope to get someone with the sterling qualities of public service and commitment to public policy that is reflected in the lives and careers of both of those gentlemen
8488601 they are our models as we start out in this search
8488602 he had an interest in local carbondale and jackson county government and politics and he had an interest in international affairs he certainly had an interest in national politics as well
8488603 they need to have had a distinguished career in public service public or political life
8488604 i only watched a few innings of this game and saw volquez throw high and tight to lohse who quickly after being brushed back stared a hole through volquezs head the fact that volquez didnt get anything makes no sense punish both or neither but throwing at people is part of the game so ill side with punish neither
8488605 i know jerry kill and his staff had recruited well in the past i expect that and dale lennon to merge together well and im sure there will be a little shifting and adjusting i would expect them to field an outstanding football team and be competitive
8488606 obviously they have a very talented football team but what they are going to bring to the league depends on the transition they have with the new coaching staff
8488607 we are anticipating a whale of a game when they come to our place i know they have been a perennial power in the fcs and we look forward to that competition
8488608 dale lennon is as sound in character as he is in philosophy he lines up with a good plan and good personnel that is accountable for their position when it is all said and done i expect them to have a sound team
8488609 i know they will play great defense and should throw the ball around a bunch i would bet my paycheck that theyll be a similar team to the ones coach kill had in terms of ability to compete on a national level
8488610 they are going to be a quality opponent there is no doubt about it they are going to play quality football all the way through the season and that will be a game that we will have to prepare for to the best of our ability because they are going to be very very good
8488611 coach lennon has had an excellent track record and the players they have are very talented players i would expect them to be awfully good like they are every year but i think you can say that about every team in the conference at this point
8488612 here pay a lot for this fancy device that could do so much more if we opened it up use it exactly as we tell you to use this program click here no not there
8488613 im really excited to play in front of my old coaches and show everybody how far weve come and how much better ive got
8488614 shes getting a little worried about going back i told her even on her worst days shes so athletic that shes still not bad
8488615 she gets to play in front of her family and they dont get to travel down here very much
8488616 shes just really excited about it and ready to play
8488617 weve got a lot of girls returning weve had a great preseason weve improved defensively weve had some people really improve and had a lot of good competition
8488618 our non conference season is really one that weve worked on to get a balance between home and away contests
8488619 when i got here they recruits were a little further west
8488620 i think florida is one of those teams that is looking to take the next step up in the southeastern conference
8488621 i think we could be one of those teams that they may not pay attention to and we could sneak it away from them
8488622 florida is going to be big strong and aggressive that is just what you get when playing against the sec but we will have nothing to lose in that tournament
8488623 anyway you cut it all of those teams are playoff teams and it should be a great challenge for us
8488624 its a new attitude everybodys been focused on the task at hand
8488625 i can play with finesse when i have to but i dont like to
8488626 i would rather hit the ball hard but if i have to play finesse to win i will
8488627 its interesting to see new players play returners because old players think theyre better and new players are fighting for a spot
8488628 i definitely think this team can be better than last year
8488629 just before i started to make these pictures i had a moment of panic what if i cant find beauty diversity what if they dont look good
8488630 i realized i saw a face actually a face in it a sign
8488631 i always said i wouldnt work with children and sex and i wouldnt work with shit so when i came up with this idea which dawned on him to the best of his recollection during the nude wrestling scene in borat i had to put myself in a special place i had to prepare myself mentally it was a scientific and aesthetic investigation
8488632 i saw a dog face in the dog shit then i became less nervous as i started to make the work i felt a close affinity with goya and the work he did at the end of life the underworld creatures i too started to see figures and creatures in this work
8488633 the worst part is the smell of certain animals i would have a mask on for those occasions the human is the worst and then dog but we pick up dog shit every day in new york i would look at it from all angles sometimes i wore a glove sometimes it had things in it debris and garbage and that became part of the picture too
8488634 i realized how ingrained the word shit is in the english language my work is all about language
8488635 im not so surprised to hear some of these hawkish sounds coming from the ecb they are facing after all inflation that is double their target
8488636 the big story continues to be about the euro zone and japan and the disappointment in relative growth people knew the situation in the us wasnt great but they now have to face a deceleration in the euro zone a lot quicker than many had anticipated
8488637 investors are unlikely to come back to the market unless they can see an end to us credit concerns and the global economic slowdown
8488638 he has lost his house his family and his job and a lot of his pride
8488639 we couldnt have been any worse the first two games
8488640 all jiva products are formulated to help people address the practical problems of living a modern lifestyle
8488641 i recommend jiva lutein to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of the computer or television but its also a great preventive product that can protect vision into old age
8488642 suspensi itu dalam rangka cooling down selama 2 sesi yang dilakukan di pasar reguler dan pasar tunai
8488643 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8488644 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8488645 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up
8488646 that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8488647 he gets sad if i dont let him finish in my mouth
8488648 celebrate youth over and over is a nice instrumental opener that could fit on any of rogue waves newer albums
8488649 does it meet the highest standards for advancing the cause of liberty
8488650 your fists of evil are about to meet my steel wall of niceness
8488651 changing the culture at our schools begins with a drive from leaders at each school
8488652 these principals are taking over some of the toughest assignments in the los angeles unified school district and they will be the strong leaders we need who understand the needs of students
8488653 one of our pressing issues is low test scores so we will be working to make sure they are more academically prepared
8488654 my immediate vision is to develop a culture of academic excellence excellence for both our staff and students
8488655 if we dont establish a culture and establish it under a unified staff it is going to be difficult to ensure academic excellence we need everyone on the same page
8488656 were really going to focus on literacy with these kids
8488657 they will be helping them supporting them making sure theyre doing their job making sure they have the resources so they can be successful making sure theyre actually able to be successful making sure theyre including parents and most importantly focusing on keeping our kids safe and making sure there is plenty of instruction going on
8488658 to the mayors credit one of the things he gave us the opportunity to do is to is find the very very best educators in order to do this work we have to have educators who are great teachers and great administrators who love instruction
8488659 we have a disconnect with our parents we need better alignment
8488660 absolutely amazed by what they saw graffiti blood dilapidated facilities things that havent been addressed in a very long time
8488661 rather than blaming the abominable dropout statistics if we are going to decrease the number of dropouts the responsibility must be approached as a shared responsibility
8488662 based upon the expectation of all stakeholders that students will not dropout before graduating differentiated resources must be provided as needed
8488663 we will be working with students at the middle schools to get them ready for high school looking closely at their grades and credits in addition our student counselors will be really working close with students monitoring attendance and seeing students are on the right track to graduate
8488664 its a really complex issue and to talk about a solution means you have to tackle it at the elementary level where students dont have the proper foundation to be successful in later years
8488665 once they get to high school fewer than 10 percent of minority children pass the california standardized tests in math or science my emphasis is in this field and im talking to colleagues at cal state l a about starting a teaching university that would provide teacher training so that elementary school teachers can be better prepared to teach math and science
8488666 when kids are successful they stay in school its only when they fail that they drop out but its a matter of preparation math has to be done every single day because if they dont have the basic skills to add subtract multiply and divide theyre not going to be successful
8488667 coming out of slavery african americans werent part of the industrial revolution
8488668 then we had the depression world war ii and the post war consumer goods boom racism persisted and despite brown vs board nothing changed then we had the space age and we missed out on that in the 70s 80s and 90s the internet age created millionaires and billionaires but not one of them black
8488669 and here we are in the renewable energy age and once again we dont have any scientists mathematicians and engineers that can go out there and build companies and build wealth weve got hydrogen hybrids and all that stuff but african americans make up less than three percent of engineering and science graduates you do the math
8488670 this strategic review comes as the company focuses on enhancing its core business and leveraging its assets
8488671 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring f
8488672 these costs were tightly controlled during the year despite an escalating capital and operating costs environment that continued to adversely affect the mining industry
8488673 i do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also might be in us so that the world may believe that thou has sent me
8488674 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8488675 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8488676 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority these human rights belong to human nature and are inherent in the person from the moment of conception until death
8488677 formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense the church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life
8488678 those who are excommunicated and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion
8488679 after setting forth our capital and credit plan august 8 we are now putting a senior management structure in place to drive this plan across the company this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities and we have to organize and staff accordingly
8488680 may your name be established and honored forever so that all the world will say the lord almighty is god over israel
8488681 now i will make your name famous throughout the earth
8488682 like sorry i cant work today cause its the end of the world
8488683 cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do nothing to prove and its you and me and all of the people and i dont know why i cant keep my eyes off of you
8488684 what is all that egypt italy greece germania asia what is all that its the world my lord thats what it is to us its the world to whom we are to be the light we our people
8488685 not in the temple but in the world and in the world i learn what the world is and what the world will teach and i am of the world the worlds made of wood and stone and iron and i work in it no not in the temple in the world and i study torah and i pray with the assembly and on feasts i go to jerusalem to stand before the lord in the temple but this is in the world all this in the world and when it is time for me to do what the lord has sent me to do in this world this world which belongs to him this world of wood and stone and iron and grass and air he will reveal it to me and what this carpenter shall yet build in this world on that day the lord knows and he lord shall reveal it
8488686 the heavens belong to the lord but he has given the earth to all humanity
8488687 though hostile nations surround me i destroyed them all in the name of the lord
8488688 you have to admire wayne for picking a left field choice
8488689 it will be fascinating to hear from the chairman as to why he roberts is the right guy
8488690 it will be a privilege to contribute to the companys governance
8488691 caroline said rene was showering george with gifts and that its all for sex
8488692 she said that george was renes toyboy and gordon was very jealous of the gifts that rene was showering george with
8488693 you dont have to worry about me daddy gordon loves me he wouldnt hurt a hair on my head
8488694 we were very lucky that the pilots skill allowed him to land the aircraft where he did
8488695 had he crashed across the road he would have gone straight into the primary school
8488696 he managed to land the aircraft in such a way as to protect the public
8488697 i saw the plane go right into the garage thank god i had ryan with me outside
8488698 it was very scary i was in such a panic and in such shock
8488699 this is not a safe environment for people living here
8488700 he was here one day and then not the next
8488701 he had plans of going to france and flying for
8488702 he was a pretty social guy and got along well with everyone
8488703 he was forced to do a spiral dive he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8488704 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont
8488705 im tired of it dripping oil in my drive the old man wont fix it if you can get it out of my drive that truck is yours and you dont have to pay me a thing
8488706 we started in a class just like this a beginners class through john a logan college we took the beginners class three of four times and then moved on to more advanced classes
8488707 we were immediately drawn to all dancing offers and have remained committed ever since our first beginners class
8488708 i really look forward to learning how to become a better dancer this is just something fun to do eventually id like to be coordinated enough not to step on any toes
8488709 this was something i had never thought about but after looking at the calendar of events something about ballroom dancing stuck
8488710 i was a little surprised when he first introduced the idea of dancing but very excited i never thought he would do something like this but what girl doesnt enjoy dancing
8488711 it costs 1 million for each additional car and there is just not enough money for that right now
8488712 now it is being blocked by a group of republicans who voted against it in the senate and there is a veto threat from president bush
8488713 its going to take time but i believe my crystal ball is saying that something good will happen by next year
8488714 your type hasnt been working out too well for you maybe its time for a change
8488715 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need john mccain is not a bad man but hes badly mistaken to embrace the bush agenda for america
8488716 the power of american ideals will always remain unsurpassed so long as we as citizens accept the responsibility to advance the cause of freedom and equality everywhere barack obama shares these values
8488717 there is a clear choice in this election for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies
8488718 barack obama is the change we need in the 21st century we are the land of the free because we are still the home of the brave
8488719 im not sure what they ah sell in they are but it sure doesnt smell good

8488724 what i value most about pastor wright is not his day to day political advice
8488725 hes much more of a sounding board for me to make sure that i am speaking as truthfully about what i believe as possible and that im not losing myself in some of the hype and hoopla and stress thats involved in national politics
8488726 recieved a nice little letter from hillarys campaign asking for a controbution this was my response

8488738 no hell just talk about what a wonderful guy biden is but when you think about it whos joe biden he ran 20 years ago for president he only got into the race this time because of a menopausal midlife crisis he was leaving the senate and he figured ill just do one more shot and run for president before i fade from the scene he was retiring
8488739 ill just do one more shot and run for president before i fade from the scene
8488740 how and why i feel god has called me to serve him in this position
8488741 i feel so comforted by the fact that youre an independent i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards
8488742 my reaction to that is grow up they have to just grow up
8488743 look i want honest authentic people on our air i dont want phonies so if the price of that is every once in a while one of these bubbles up im not concerned
8488744 like any good manager i give and i take and i massage and i deal with it
8488745 but the fact of the matter is this is what we want a diverse fun rough and tumble look at politics
8488746 back in black i hit the sack ive been too long im glad to be back
8488747 the only certainty is that the vehicle was light coloured and the make and model cant be confirmed from witness accounts
8488748 there are other possible sightings of ciara further along stirling highway so it cant be confirmed if she did or did not get into this vehicle
8488749 how can you possibly expect the obama campaign to send someone to be on your show on short notice in the middle of the democratic convention
8488750 my heinous friends dared me to ask for a quick interview since im a blogger here in town
8488751 this is jill foster in denver creating a mobile media portrait of the dnc and bigtent events im here with the ever fantastic james carville who agreed to give 20 seconds of his time to answer one questions
8488752 if god can create the heavens the earth the oceans the animals human beings and the gift of light in only 6 days why is it so irrational to think that he can impregnate a mortal woman with his child and have the woman remain pure

8488755 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8488756 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8488757 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8488758 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8488759 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8488760 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8488761 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8488762 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8488763 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8488764 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8488765 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8488766 lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8488767 this is something people like me have been waiting for for days weeks years
8488768 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8488769 now sen obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the old fashioned american dream his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8488770 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8488771 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8488772 and heres what i have to say about that everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8488773 the most effective and the most important speech bill clinton has delivered since he left the white house
8488774 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8488775 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8488776 to make money on top of it even makes it worse
8488777 they werent giving it way they were selling it for 3
8488778 its not the policy of this party to use this low level of humor
8488779 one lady was very irate but the other nine or ten people i spoke to were concerned
8488780 the supervision of the division of elections is a responsibility of the person now behind don young
8488781 huh im the governor huh minnesota im the governor of minnesota
8488782 rhetoric reality and the internet what do voters really want
8488783 we are still seeing a wide gap between what voters expect and what campaigns are delivering online
8488784 the campaign dollars being spent for television ads on the olympics are not being further enhanced by paid online ads on olympic related websites
8488785 we wanted to play in the champions league we have been in the semi final and final the last two years it was a tough match but we believed in ourselves and it was a good performance
8488786 they were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8488787 platsen s g ut som att vara tagen ur en kinesisk saga
8488788 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
8488789 the fairgrounds belong to the public and we need to preserve that
8488790 mccains a liberal wow i guess ill vote for him then
8488791 let us make people in our image to be like ourselves they will be masters over all of life
8488792 you dont belong here this place is not for you for it is a jungle
8488793 the real target of the bangsamoro juridical entity is not only the american and china interests for building bases in mindanao because of its strategic location but vested interests of mining plantations and logging of muslim and christian politicians ruling dynasties for decades now in mindanao
8488794 it is after all money personal and political interests not really the welfare and interests that muddles the mindanao agenda for lasting peace and development
8488795 to some of the bangsamoro peoples the certificate of ancestral domain titles cadt issued by ncip are mere scrap paper the least toilet paper the most because in reality the philippine government cant protect us if we assert our rights in our ancestral domain claims within bje
8488796 ermita and dureza were right in saying there is no need to grant autonomy for lumads in mindanao because what we really wanted for now is independence and historically our demands are legal because it was our forefathers who are first inhabitants of mindanao
8488797 oust gma framework and already had a prepared output for the undertakings which are anti government and does not represent the true state and sentiments of the tribes
8488798 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8488799 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8488800 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8488801 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8488802 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8488803 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8488804 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8488805 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8488806 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8488807 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea change does not start from the top down it starts from the bottom up
8488808 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8488809 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8488810 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8488811 we need a leader who understands that you dont vote against funding for troops in harms way we need a leader who supports victory in iraq and doesnt try to legislate failure
8488812 americans have seen with their own eyes what joe biden has repeatedly made clear barack obama does not have the judgment or experience to be president of the united states
8488813 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8488814 90 percent of george bush is just more than we can take
8488815 are you kidding before debating barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8488816 the bush mccain republicans have been wrong again and again and again
8488817 use trust networks and social constructs to balance security with ease of extensibility
8488818 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8488819 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8488820 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8488821 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8488822 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8488823 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8488824 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8488825 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8488826 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8488827 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8488828 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8488829 in a way i guess de sica helped pay for the refurbishment of his own film
8488830 its an important project and we are very proud to be associated with it
8488831 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8488832 in a way i guess de sica helped pay for the refurbishment of his own film
8488833 its an important project and we are very proud to be associated with it
8488834 the second night of the 2004 convention saw barack obama tearing apart the arena
8488835 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
8488836 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
8488837 guys come by and tell me its happened to them and to keep my head up and i am doing that
8488838 i dont know what the key is but i know its more noticeable especially with the twins being in the pennant race and with us having the lead
8488839 out left handers just havent been getting left handers out
8488840 if the left on left thing worked then i would have brought in jimenez to face morneau but the twins wear out left handers
8488841 i thought i was going to score on that one
8488842 i got a good jump and i was really running but hes got a great arm and he made the perfect throw
8488843 i tried to go for the plate but when the ball beats you to the plate by that much theyre generally going to call you out
8488844 there is competition between the three of us but next year in spring training well see what happens we can worry about that then
8488845 the three of us want to establish ourselves as starters i need to show i can pitch at this level just like they can
8488846 what i particularly liked was that after he got in trouble he was able to come back with three consecutive scoreless innings
8488847 he indicated to me that he was a little sore
8488848 as a manager when you pitch your closer two days in a row and that word sore comes up its tough to put him back out there
8488849 i cant hear from somebody that my arm hurts and put him out there with good conscience if we were fighting for a playoff spot hed have been in there
8488850 i talked to dwight and he said morrow just didnt have a good night
8488851 morrow feels great thats the main thing hes feeling healthy and hes raring to go with his next start
8488852 its really to draw attention to the artwork that was made for the record the o is like a symbol but we all call it different names i call it masks some people call it o
8488853 the high school kids are all fucked up touching each other oh my god forty ounces was never enough we wanna pass out in your yard dressing in drag while boys kiss boys
8488854 i laid on my bed let the punk record spin the sloppy guitar it was shooting out stars they all went to my heart some rainbows in the dark
8488855 all my friends were musicians and artists i learned so much from them ive watched bright eyes and all our friends bands just start touring the country and then start touring internationally
8488856 i was just like thats actually something that we can do with tilly we have had the opportunity to do that
8488857 were going to tour the us in september opening up for css
8488858 you always think about the crowd and the audience that theyre actually there to see our show and support us we are lucky to do what we do i get really excited to play live
8488859 i plan the set so that i have breaks every three or four songs the first couple of weeks on tour i am exhausted but then you just get used to it
8488860 when you have to do it every day its like your body adjusts but even if you practice every day its not the same as performing you so much have adrenaline going i dance differently it is a rush
8488861 im really conscious of what i eat and i try to stay as healthy as possible otherwise i get sick i used to get sick all on tour the time i had pneumonia three times in one year because my body would get so tired when we were touring i would eat whatever i would drink the last couple of years i havent gotten sick i think its because im really careful of what i eat on tour
8488862 usually the person who wrote the song will bring the skeleton of a song to practice whether its the lyrics and a guitar part or keyboards then the person kind of directs you like i want it to sound punk i want it to sound rough i want it to sound poppy
8488863 ive always loved marching bands and i wanted to bring that sound in to a record i try to draw inspiration from everything music friends relationships
8488864 theres a very slow pace of life and everybody stays inside a lot because the weather is really extreme its either like freezing or really hot theres only three weeks out of the year where its nice weather so youre indoors a lot which allows you to be a little bit more creative i think
8488865 do what you love do what makes you happy and dont ever have regrets in your life
8488866 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8488867 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8488868 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8488869 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year
8488870 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8488871 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8488872 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum
8488873 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock
8488874 si pues yo entre aqui bla bla bla tengo poco tiempo bla bla bla y gracias al jefe lagarto estoy trabajando aqui bla bla bla

8488883 educational philosophy and leadership style were incompatible with the hudson school committees expectations
8488884 anyone who is working to be a superintendent in any state under these regulatory conditions are as vulnerable as someone who coaches an nfl team
8488885 to help move the public schools from good to great instead we are beginning another academic year moving in the opposite direction
8488886 in the last two budget cycles i have been forced to reduce school staff by more than 70 employees the vast majority of them teachers and to abandon plans to bring our schools to the next level academically our investment in the education of our students is now below average in every single category

8488895 i think i want to be the next dr ruth
8488896 well its more of an idea than an actual plan
8488897 we are we do have the bona fides to defend the military
8488898 the reality is that this is not the time to have somebody who has no executive experience as president of the united states
8488899 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8488900 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8488901 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded

8488918 those horns you hear are out of jubilation said chris armstrong a highway patrol officer from gilroy at a ribbon cutting ceremony wednesday
8488919 at 3 p m on that wednesday i hit traffic on 101 at gilroy just north of 10th street about three miles north i thought that there must be a wreck at or near one of the exits so we crept along
8488920 nothing just slow three hours or so later we got to the 152 and 156 and lo and behold people were stopping to let traffic going to hollister make a left turn
8488921 i got flipped off because i did not stop i didnt have to
8488922 i know a lot of truckers who are very happy about this
8488923 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8488924 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8488925 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back
8488926 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8488927 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8488928 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8488929 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8488930 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8488931 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8488932 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8488933 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8488934 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8488935 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8488936 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home

8488938 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain

8488964 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8488965 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8488966 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8488967 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8488968 i dont know of anybody in the new york delegation who hasnt been interviewed at least once

8488974 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8488975 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8488976 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8488977 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8488978 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8488979 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8488980 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8488981 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8488982 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8488983 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8488984 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8488985 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8488986 perhaps you should research mr franks record a little more
8488987 what about chernoble and three mile island nuclear power is dangerous and harmful
8488988 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8488989 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8488990 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8488991 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8488992 i was just so proud to show off my big old
8488993 plut t que de parler de contrat dexclusivit je pr f re parler de focalisation de nos ressources sur un distributeur

8488999 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses
8489000 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities
8489001 the reality is that this management and this board have failed investors and failed their public mission
8489002 why should we have great confidence that they have finally made the right choice after stumbling
8489003 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8489004 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8489005 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8489006 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8489007 geez where are the vending machines im dying of thirst this is outrageous
8489008 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8489009 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted
8489010 with anwar ibrahim in parliament we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8489011 the walls are crumbling but the top guy seems oblivious to his surroundings
8489012 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8489013 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8489014 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8489015 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8489016 my parents business is broke and luis is out of work the financial world there is a saying that says that if the u s gets the flu mexico gets pneumonia and that is what is happening over here there is a huge domino effect on our economy because of the possible recession gas prices etc a lot of factories have shut down and many businesses are broke including my parents the good thing is my dad is retired and getting a monthly check right now it kind of feels like everything is messed up we are not sad or depressed or anything we are hopeful trying to discern the will of god please be praying for juarez too since february there have been 467 drug related murders over 500 now since the first of the year these murders are happening in broad daylight in the middle of high traffic streets three men were killed last week outside of our neighborhood so this has brought a lot of despair to the city and the people are in a general hysteria
8489017 now juarez has won the title of most violven city in the world
8489018 but this is just another title distracting people from presence of god

8489020 this stunning novel begins on a winter night in 1964 when a blizzard forces dr david henry to deliver his own twins his son born first is perfectly healthy but the doctor immediately recognizes that his daughter has down syndrome for motives he tells himself are good he makes a split second decision that will haunt all their lives forever he asks his nurse caroline to take the baby away to an institution instead she disappears into another city to raise the child as her own compulsively readable and deeply moving the memory keepers daughter is a brilliantly crafted story of parallel lives familial secrets and the redemptive power of love
8489021 friends are just like stars you know they are always there even you cant see them
8489022 our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
8489023 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8489024 barack obama knows this too we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8489025 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8489026 barack obama gets it like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story

8489033 is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8489034 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8489035 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8489036 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8489037 in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8489038 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8489039 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years and back to unity and hope if like me you believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8489040 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8489041 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8489042 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8489043 it is evident from the circumstances that such use of the word olympic refers to the naturally occurring mountains or geographical region of the same name that were named prior to february 6 1998 and not to the corporation or any olympic activity
8489044 s uch business goods or services are operated sold and marketed in the state of washington west of the cascade mountain range and operations sales and marketing outside of this area are not substantial
8489045 and sales and marketing outside of this area are not substantial
8489046 as a washington state resident and small business owner im outraged that washington states congressional delegation was asleep at the wheel when this little stay in washington state clause was allowed to slip through unchallenged in the stevens act western washington state is a tech savvy place it is the home of amazon com not to mention microsoft and innumerable other dot coms past and present was the value of internet marketing especially for a growing small business that obscure in 1998 if so how come amazon ceo jeff bezos was times man of the year in 1999
8489047 our drinking water system is the lifeblood of our city and the men and women of the department of environmental protection under the leadership of commissioner emily lloyd work tirelessly to uphold the high quality and integrity of our drinking water
8489048 for new york city residents and our visitors the choice between bottled water and tap water is as easy as choosing between a frozen pizza and a slice from a new york pizzeria
8489049 once again this contest demonstrates that some of the worlds best tasting and highest quality drinking water is found in new yorks largest city
8489050 in fact by every yardstick i think its fair to say that our capital plan represents a dramatic departure from the past
8489051 lack the repetitive template of residential and office structures making development considerably more complex
8489052 i cant think of anything more important i cant think of anything that would set the parents of schoolchildren in this city to man the barricades any more than stopping the progress that we have made
8489053 pas vraiment selon alain thirel lexp riment coach saint pierrois
8489054 quand je suis arriv au club jai fait avec ce que javais cest dire avec le groupe qui tait pr sent et avec sa mentalit ladaptation fut difficile a a mis du temps pour que la mayonnaise prenne et puis jai d faire face aussi pas mal de bless s nous avons surtout manqu de r ussite lors de cette premi re partie du championnat
8489055 mon groupe est n anmoins de tr s bonne qualit avec des joueurs talentueux comme yohan ravenne qui fut retenu en s lection des moins de 20 ans ou encore le jeune setra junior joueur des moins de 15 ans qui volue a notre niveau ces jeunes sont susceptibles dint grer l quipe fanion dici quelque temps condition bien s r de faire preuve dun peu plus de s rieux et dinvestissement ce qui nest pas vident de nos jours car les jeunes ont beaucoup de loisirs leurs dispositions
8489056 nous allons travailler plus afin doccuper une place un peu plus honorable correspondant notre niveau de jeu notre vraie valeur les jeunes sont assidus aux entra nements et le calendrier nous permettra de nous situer puisquapr s le saint denis fc nous affrontons successivement lexcelsior et lusst avec la victoire quatre points tout peut aller tr s vite en tout cas nous prenons match par match et on fera le compte ensuite
8489057 nous allons affronter las chaudron au prochain tour notre but sera daller le plus loin possible a peut sauver notre saison
8489058 having rock star concert crowds and uplifting rhetoric doesnt work with working class voters shots of 200 000 mesmerized people in berlin didnt help his campaign
8489059 hes got hard work to do hes got to connect culturally and ideologically with working class voters and he can do it
8489060 weve got to convince democrats in the labor movement especially in the building trades
8489061 roll up his sleeves and go to some union meetings
8489062 i think he can do it but they feel hes not spoken to them yet
8489063 he had an 8 or 9 point lead now its a tight race
8489064 during the month of august mccain had better weeks than obama
8489065 its the late end of august a whole lot of things are going to happen between election day and now
8489066 we need in the white house starting on january 20 2009 barack obama and joe biden
8489067 algu m fez feio sim o atl tico que em 2 jogos n o conseguiu ganhar do time de juniores do spfc praticamente
8489068 a lot of people still feel general motors owes us more than just a couple hundred jobs
8489069 but as competitive as the market is and the trouble general motors is having we have to help them with whatever we can do to keep them competitive
8489070 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8489071 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8489072 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8489073 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8489074 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8489075 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8489076 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8489077 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8489078 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8489079 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8489080 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8489081 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8489082 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8489083 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8489084 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8489085 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8489086 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8489087 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8489088 the officer involved had parked his unmarked car at his home and left his pistol and badges inside the vehicle
8489089 the id card is laminated so its possible somebody could remove the lamination and put another picture on it
8489090 you hear stories about people going around impersonating police officers and getting this type of equipment is something they probably would use
8489091 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8489092 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8489093 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8489094 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8489095 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8489096 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8489097 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8489098 who are open to doing something on the production side
8489099 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8489100 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8489101 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8489102 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8489103 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8489104 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back
8489105 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8489106 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8489107 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8489108 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8489109 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8489110 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8489111 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8489112 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8489113 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8489114 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8489115 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8489116 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8489117 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8489118 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8489119 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8489120 i am grateful to valencia for this gesture and for all that the club has given me and to vicente soriano for the effort he has made
8489121 we are all very happy and cazorla is going to be an extremely important player for villarreal over the next six years calm is returning to the squad which was shaken in recent hours

8489135 thats a great list you should also check out studio 360 and radio lab
8489136 my father was an attorney during my childhood he once told me that writing is the most important element of a successful law career your future is as bright as the sun i look forward to more installments on the journey of your life
8489137 give me a fucking break i was raised by a black woman for christs sake
8489138 oh youre from the south theyre very racist there of course i would never marry one
8489139 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8489140 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8489141 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8489142 we respect the courts order but we dont have enough time to move out and we will launch an appeal
8489143 after the court injunction police will need to enforce this order
8489144 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimizing the hazards of behavior
8489145 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8489146 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programs which are important for saving lives
8489147 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8489148 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8489149 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8489150 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8489151 work together to re establish between the members of the various communities the peaceful coexistence and the harmony that have always marked indian society
8489152 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8489153 it seems to be a very technical speech about being a democrat supporting obama as a democrat but she never answered the big question on whether he was ready
8489154 i appreciate there can be debate about the most reliable indicators of school effectiveness but i cannot understand why public institutions such as schools should not be accountable to the community that funds their salaries and their running costs right now we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving this must change parents have a right to information to inform their familys decision making about school enrolment it is important too that this information gives parents the full picture simplistic league tables dont really tell us how well a school is performing they dont tell us about the student population that the school started with and its level of educational advantage everyone understands why a private school on sydneys north shore might do better than a comprehensive government high school in the outer suburbs but it is not unreasonable to expect that schools with a similar mix of students and similar starting points should do equally well what parents most want to know is what difference a school is going to make in other words the extent to which it is adding value to the results of their students parents overseas can get this information australian parents and students deserve the same that is why today i announce that we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from 1 january 2009 within a year we want to see increased information available to australian parents and within three years a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools knowing where there is underperformance will help us to target additional resources
8489155 for years state labor administrations have sided with unions to reject transparency and have aggressively fought media attempts to use freedom of information laws to secure information on the relative performance of schools
8489156 with a line drawing of a native american man were all just whispering
8489157 ok they can tell the difference between dark elves and high elves now
8489158 sayaka never used to be able to shred like that
8489159 america is facing its greatest economic challenges since the great depression
8489160 baghdad beijing hawaii i got an e mail from vatican city i honestly dont know what to make of it
8489161 old and new media are converging on wrkos pundit review a show by bloggers about bloggers
8489162 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8489163 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8489164 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8489165 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8489166 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8489167 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8489168 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8489169 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8489170 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8489171 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8489172 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8489173 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8489174 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8489175 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8489176 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8489177 the powers not delegated to the united states by the
8489178 we read your paper we found it very interesting do you think you could prove it to us
8489179 well have a lab ready for you in 2 days
8489180 write a list of everything youll need to do your research
8489181 im sure youve got a lot of questions mr irving my name is rachael and im here to answer as many of them as i can
8489182 you are here because what you found out can in no way ever be made public and you were about to do just that can you imagine what would happen to the world if someone could prove the existence of god chaos widespread panic and people would be so pissed to learn that god really does exist and they still havent won the fuckin lottery no matter how much they pray weve been working on it for some time playing around with the notion of finding god but have never come up with a way to do it you may have found one and that interests us wed like to fund your research give you anything you need
8489183 i said wed give you anything you need not anything you want letting you go would be the opposite of what we were trying to accomplish listen matt is it okay if i call you matt we can either kill you or pay you but we cant let you go
8489184 ive got cancer the doctors say ive only got a few weeks to live at the most and im so scared can you show me god again
8489185 and for those who are were providing as many options as possible to help students meet the requirements without sacrificing their favorite activities
8489186 who is that little boy who else came in town
8489187 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8489188 contributive efforts are better because you are not relying on one individual
8489189 you will get individual performances brilliantly but its always better to win through a team effort everyone can enjoy it that way

8489194 believe me i dont wish to get out of it
8489195 espero que o resultado d um novo alento para o grupo a auto estima est abalada mas eu confiei neles o que aconteceu no ltimo jogo com o s o paulo foi anormal n o merec amos perder por 3 a 1 o jogo com o atl tico mineiro me decepcionou muito mas provou que eles podem atuar de maneira diferente eles mesmo sentiram isto
8489196 a satisfa o muito grande por termos passado pelo s o paulo tenho certeza que o muricy ramalho escalou o melhor que ele tinha eu escalei o que eu tinha de melhor n o quer dizer que a gente despreze a competi o o muricy quer ser campe o brasileiro e eu quero tirar o time da zona de rebaixamento mas ningu m entrou em campo pra n o ganhar

8489198 independentemente de quem fez ou errou o importante foi que conseguimos a classifica o esta vit ria com certeza vai dar confian a pra gente
8489199 o time n o tomava dois gols h algum tempo o time sofreu o segundo quando estava em vantagem num rica serginho foi expulso e precisamos corrigir isso este detalhe n o pode passar despercebido
8489200 jogamos bem posicionados em campo t nhamos um certo desgaste mas o time soube controlar bem quando esteve com a bola mudei o posicionamento de alguns jogadores como o gil e o carlos alberto durante a partida e isso tamb m nos ajudou
8489201 o t cnico muricy ramalho perguntou quem estava acostumado a bater p nalti e n s jogadores fomos levantando a m o e pedindo para bater eles deixam a gente bastante tranq ilos
8489202 a gente o time da base n o est acostumado com competi es assim mas est tudo tranq ilo fizemos uma tima partida
8489203 eu consegui estufar as redes batendo de primeira porque a marca o estava muito forte e tive de antever a jogada eu dedico um para a laurinha e o outro para o levi
8489204 eu conversei com a comiss o t cnica e combinei com o ney franco t cnico que iria tentar jogar pelo menos um tempo de qualquer forma como o time estava bem facilitou para eu n o me desgastar
8489205 s vamos ver se tenho condi es de atuar na representa o do grupo na sexta feira nesta quarta tive um cansa o natural
8489206 every american who was trying to do the right thing
8489207 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8489208 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8489209 civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split as a general thing
8489210 multiple ethics investigations some related to the wide ranging federal corruption probe in the state and others concerning a controversial earmark benefitting a florida developer
8489211 baghdad beijing hawaii i got an e mail from vatican city i honestly dont know what to make of it
8489212 old and new media are converging on wrkos pundit review a show by bloggers about bloggers
8489213 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8489214 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8489215 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8489216 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8489217 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8489218 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8489219 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8489220 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8489221 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8489222 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8489223 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8489224 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8489225 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8489226 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8489227 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8489228 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8489229 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8489230 fox was sending lawyers who were looking at all the commas and the dots
8489231 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8489232 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8489233 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8489234 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8489235 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8489236 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8489237 tavitas a lot better in year 2 in the system than he was in year one
8489238 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8489239 the no 1 thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8489240 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8489241 never look down on anybody unless you are helping him up
8489242 i hope she will supply to the staff her vision on how to create offense
8489243 and give us her insight on what she saw on the other side of the world
8489244 we have close ties with all the usa volleyball people including the bachmans
8489245 usually a guahibo wife just has the baby out by the creek cuts the cord and walks back into the village
8489246 pray that we can get the book of daniel ready to be checked in november by a translation consultant
8489247 it would be wonderful to get it to the place where we could print it
8489248 besides these things many nasty things are being said about those who have chosen to step out and believe in jesus christ
8489249 please pray that those who are baby believers will only grow stronger in their faith as they learn that the life of faith in christ does not mean ease of life
8489250 gods word says that we will have to endure persecution
8489251 so i proceeded in a couple of hours to try and take him from adam and eve all the way to the ascension of christ
8489252 he was all ears and said that what he was hearing was not at all the bad stuff that people were saying about us
8489253 this stuff is sweet to my stomach we are going to have to sit down and talk a lot more about this
8489254 i dont think he has made it a personal thing yet but he is very close
8489255 they are also complaining of the lootings perpetrated by the military in their houses in barangays lapok tapikan tukanalipao dapiawan diate even as they said that some civilians were killed by the air strikes and mortar shelling by the military
8489256 since august 26 2008 the army had been indiscriminately firing their cannons toward the suspected positions of milf forces at piagapo lanao del sur sad to point out that the place where the cannons were put up were more or less 100 meters away from the administration building of msu marawi
8489257 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
8489258 i liked it i took it back to my administrative team and they liked it
8489259 go to work send your kids to schoolfollow fashion act normalwalk on the pavements watch t v save for your old age obey the lawrepeat after me i am free
8489260 ive seen you do your thing in madden but i wanna let you know i will bust your ass in that madden we can get it poppin on 100 000 dollars the winner can take the money and donate it to charity live on youtube
8489261 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8489262 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it
8489263 if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
8489264 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8489265 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8489266 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8489267 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8489268 or to put it in the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life
8489269 none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide
8489270 catholics especially politicians who publicly defend abortion should not receive communion and ministers of communion should be responsibly charitable in denying it to them if they ask for it until they have reformed their lives
8489271 abortion including the willful destruction of human embryos and euthanasia are always intrinsically evil since they involve the intentional killing of innocent life
8489272 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8489273 of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
8489274 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8489275 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8489276 would offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8489277 obviously my party wasnt going to nominate a black candidate for the white house so im glad democrats did it
8489278 were in a real close real tight race and this guy has a real shot at winning at the end of the day this is an extraordinary candidate
8489279 the bottom line is clinton gave great lines but that doesnt give barack the commander in chief credibility
8489280 after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8489281 she said obama was unprepared to lead unprepared to be the commander in chief that he was unprepared to handle the 3 a m call
8489282 he said you have candidate x who you agree with 100 percent of the time but you dont think can get the job done and you have candidate y who you agree with half the time but can get the job done
8489283 who do you think is y and who do you think is x i suspect that the clintons still are under a serious question as to obamas preparedness
8489284 i was not just disappointed but rather i was insulted
8489285 obama has no record whatsoever doing that and john mccain has a long record of doing that so that should be at the core of the response
8489286 we have agreed that we are not going to constantly emphasise where were not

8489291 we are working out a fresh equity structure sci with financial institutions and others is likely to have 50 per cent equity ongc will have 25 per cent equity and the rest of the equity will be with a third partner
8489292 the proposal has revived we have had several rounds of meetings but nothing has been finalised as yet
8489293 what can we do to get you to buy this car today
8489294 obama in the flesh is a new energy policy for the pepsi center it will take a divine act of intervention for the dems to lose after an almighty day like today something happened today and hopefully the negativity thats sure to come out of minnesota wont ruin the democratic love train
8489295 i think its a good move said joshua rosner an analyst with independent research firm graham fisher amp co in new york
8489296 i think it speaks to the intent to bolster confidence
8489297 water stations and sanitary facilities will be provided within the zone
8489298 judge krieger relied on assurances that the city would provide water and sanitation facilities at the demonstration zone and theyre not
8489299 its just one more thing making it inhospitable for protesters its so desolate there that no one wants to use it
8489300 the whole idea was that it was supposed to be within sight and sound of delegates who would be walking on this path by the demonstration site to the convention none of the delegates are walking on that path

8489305 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8489306 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8489307 what the fuck is he matter with this country that this is even a race
8489308 it gives us a little bit of a safety net
8489309 you realize the commitment these guys made its a big one
8489310 theyre not just doing it with their time theyre doing it with their lives
8489311 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8489312 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8489313 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8489314 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8489315 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8489316 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats

8489331 civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split as a general thing
8489332 well im just saying this as an option and not
8489333 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night

8489336 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8489337 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8489338 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8489339 i think the race will come down to the end

8489351 barangsiapa yang tidak berniat puasa sebelum fajar maka tiada baginya puasa itu
8489352 dan makan dan minumlah kalian sampai jelas bagi kalian putihnya siang dan hitamnya malam dari fajar
8489353 fajar itu ada dua adapun yang pertama maka dibolehkan makan dan tidak boleh melakukan sholat sedang yang kedua maka diharamkam makan dan dibolehkan sholat
8489354 termasuk kebidahan yang mungkar adalah apa yang terjadi pada masa ini yaitu mengadakan azan yang kedua kira kira sepertiga jam sebelum fajar dalam bulan ramadhan dan mematikan lentera lentera sebagai alamat untuk menghentikan makan dan minum bagi yang ingin berpuasa dengan persangkaan bahwa apa yang mereka perbuat itu demi kehati hatian dalam beribadah hal seperti itu tidak diketahui kecuali dari segelintir orang saja hal tersebut membawa mereka untuk tidak azan kecuali setelah terbenam beberapa waktu lamanya untuk memastikan masuknya waktu menurut persangkaan mereka lalu mengakhirkan buka puasa dan mempercepat sahur maka mereka telah menyelisihi sunnah rasulullah oleh karena itu sedikit sekali kebaikan mereka dan lebih banyak kejelekan pada diri mereka
8489355 jika telah datang waktu malam dari arah sini dan pergi waktu siang dari arah sini serta telah terbenam matahari maka orang yang berpuasa telah berbuka
8489356 yang membedakan antara puasa kita dengan puasa ahli kitab adalah makan sahur
8489357 sesungguhnya dia adalah berkah yang diberikan allah kepada kalian maka jangan kalian meninggalkannya
8489358 sahur adalah makanan berkah maka jangan kalian tinggalkan walaupun salah seorang dari kalian hanya meneguk seteguk air karena allah dan para malaikat bersalawat atas orang orang yang bersahur
8489359 kami bersahur bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian beliau pergi untuk solat
8489360 dan makanlah dan minumlah kalian sampai jelas baggi kalian benang putih siang dari benang hitam malam dari fajar
8489361 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan berkata bohong dan beramal dengannya maka allah tidak butuh dengan usahanya meninggalkan makan dan minum
8489362 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mendapatkan fajar subuh dalam keadaan junub dari keluarganya kemudian mandi dan berpuasa
8489363 manusia akan senantiasa dalam kebaikan selama mereka mempercepat buka puasanya
8489364 agama ini akan senantiasa menang selama manusia kaum muslimin mempercepat buka puasanya karena orang orang yahudi dan kristen nashrani mengakhirkannya
8489365 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8489366 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8489367 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8489368 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8489369 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8489370 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8489371 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8489372 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8489373 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8489374 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8489375 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8489376 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8489377 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8489378 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8489379 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8489380 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8489381 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8489382 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8489383 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8489384 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8489385 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8489386 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8489387 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8489388 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8489389 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8489390 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8489391 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8489392 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8489393 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8489394 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8489395 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8489396 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8489397 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8489398 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8489399 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8489400 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8489401 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8489402 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8489403 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8489404 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8489405 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8489406 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8489407 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8489408 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8489409 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8489410 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8489411 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8489412 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8489413 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8489414 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8489415 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8489416 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8489417 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8489418 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8489419 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8489420 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8489421 ready to preserve protect and defend the president of the united states
8489422 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8489423 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8489424 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8489425 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8489426 we see that humanity that strength and our future in barack and and their beautiful children
8489427 she didnt want to be seen as bills third term
8489428 he was in a rage over how they used him
8489429 he was not used to the 24 7 news cycle and people with cell phones recording what he said at every stop
8489430 but you cant blame for the loss at end of the day he was a huge plus
8489431 the prospect of a custodial sentence is frightening for her
8489432 she has put herself in the position where her child will be without the mother of course many people would say well tough that is your doing you have brought this on yourself and must face the consequences what she did was thoroughly reprehensible but it has not been every case where a woman who has cried rape has gone into custody
8489433 but it has not been every case where a woman who has cried rape has gone into custody
8489434 kami membutuhkan kemenangan untuk memperbaiki peringkat dan memberikan kami kepercayaan diri
8489435 kami sangat yakin telah memilih orang yang tepat untuk pekerjaan ini dan kami menuju ke arah yang benar kami harus bersabar saya sangat tenang kami pernah bermain imbang 10 kali di musim lalu dan kami menjadi juara dengan keunggulan 10 poin
8489436 gnarls barkley 08 06 2008 boston ma 24 bit master
8489437 you dont belong here this place is not for you for it is a jungle
8489438 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8489439 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8489440 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8489441 id like to see our goods and services have access to other markets such as china turnabout is fair play if they have access to our markets we should have access to theirs
8489442 were a nation of laws the laws have to be adhered to on the other hand if theres an opportunity to change some of the laws we should look into that
8489443 id like to see us expand our markets for our agriculture based products growing up in the south in the delta
8489444 you know america was made up of immigrants from all corners of the globe if people want to come here and work hard and find the american dream and theyre willing to play by the rules im all for them and even if they came here illegally but theyre working and paying taxes raising families here their children are being born here and you know republicans talk about family values do they really want to break up families because one member may be illegal lets help these people become part of america and live the dream not disrupt them because we dont care for the color of their skin or the accent of their voice
8489445 i think they need to tighten the border more and give the people whos here an opportunity to do citizenship and give them an opportunity to stay
8489446 i think that americans pay far too much money out of our country and we are not getting the same in return which does not make sense i think we have to re examine outsourcing i think we have to re examine our relationships and our sales with other countries to get a more equitable relationship international trade is extraordinarily important and everybody benefits from it but we need a more equitable arrangement
8489447 i think americans have to realize that the only original americans were the american indians and i think its disgraceful not to welcome other people into our country certainly there needs to be some reform so were fairer in welcoming people from all over the globe not just from preferred countries but id be distressed to live in a country that did not welcome immigrants

8489461 i was mesmerized by patricks speech and so were the whole crowd of people
8489462 that speech was the finest thing that she could have done for our party
8489463 i got to see sen kennedy it was an incredible moment
8489464 the people in denver have been very receptive warm and welcoming across the board
8489465 our little pumpkin is turning one please join us in all the fun
8489466 really this is our first year and its not a bad amount of money to start off with
8489467 our hope is that each year well be able to raise more and more money whatever we raise is going right back into the schools
8489468 the way the grant process works is teachers or staff can apply for grant money and its for all students
8489469 if a director of english wanted to bring a program or add a piece of curriculum they can do that
8489470 or if they lost a program because the state took it away they could apply for grant money to get it back
8489471 we held a wine tasting event last march at the paine estate and thats where we received the bulk of our money and then we got a lot of sponsors
8489472 we decided that it was much better to do an enrichment grant program whereby teachers could bring in outside people
8489473 probably a group of actors and actresses or singers something thats not covered by the regular curriculum and would enrich the students lives or trips to the museums or theaters
8489474 she was born in scotland she came here when she was 6 years old
8489475 we just hoped we could do something enriching for pupils in the schools
8489476 i remember years ago these sorts of things used to happen in schools and now they cant do it with the budget limitations
8489477 were so fortunate to be able to implement a program that looks at education outside of the standard curriculum
8489478 we are providing our community the opportunity to creatively enhance their own learning potential across the school system its an amazing feeling to know how much hope and excitement this is generating throughout our schools
8489479 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8489480 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8489481 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8489482 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8489483 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8489484 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8489485 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8489486 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8489487 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8489488 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8489489 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8489490 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8489491 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8489492 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8489493 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8489494 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8489495 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8489496 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8489497 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8489498 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8489499 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8489500 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8489501 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8489502 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8489503 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8489504 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8489505 no one works for someone we all just work together
8489506 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8489507 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8489508 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8489509 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8489510 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8489511 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8489512 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8489513 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8489514 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8489515 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8489516 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8489517 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8489518 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8489519 because hes supposed to be in the lineup roberts played and he killed us i think im going to blame cintron for that one
8489520 its not really that big a deal they tell you have an off day but youve got to always prepare
8489521 alex got sick and there i was back in the lineup ive played enough games in my career so that i can jump back in and play
8489522 it hasnt been the kind of homestand that we drew up on a blueprint
8489523 we played all very good teams that are all in contention i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8489524 liz did enough to stay out of the big inning
8489525 he pitched around some walks i thought this time his changeup was real key for him because they were sitting on the fastball
8489526 theres just no other way of putting it i was just flat out awful
8489527 i couldnt even give us a chance to win i hope i can put this behind me pretty soon it will be a long night
8489528 john he not throw the ball the way weve see him throw the ball
8489529 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8489530 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8489531 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8489532 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8489533 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8489534 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8489535 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8489536 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8489537 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8489538 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8489539 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8489540 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8489541 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8489542 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8489543 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8489544 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8489545 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8489546 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8489547 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8489548 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8489549 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8489550 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

8489555 i have known about been friends with john mccain now for 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain
8489556 who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was a target
8489557 have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8489558 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8489559 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8489560 saying i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8489565 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8489566 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since
8489567 in america and across the globe has convinced me that gets it
8489568 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change

8489574 less secure and more isolated than at any time in our recent history

8489590 im not going to be standing there studying the call sheet and remembering every formation
8489591 ill still be involved in the game planning but its very difficult to do it all ill probably call a portion of the plays it just frees me up a little bit to do a better job of being the head coach
8489592 we had our best year ever with fundraising even with the economy the worst its ever been
8489593 but nowadays guys are going in motion shifts and all that which you have to do to get it all on paper and so forth it takes a lot of time during the week

8489598 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8489599 barisan nasional bn which won 140 parliamentary seats in the march 8 general election still commanded strong support from the people
8489600 the permatang pauh by election is one by election that cannot be interpreted as something that can happen in other constituencies i believe we can still continue the government

8489609 personally is in favor of the chief justice but there is a position in the party which says that he has become too politicized in the last many months and he has been leading rallies

8489627 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8489628 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8489629 no im not going to tell you you know already
8489630 seldom does a storytelling talent come along as potent and fully mature as mike brotherton his complex characters take you on a voyage that is both fiercely credible and astonishingly imaginative this is science fiction

8489633 readers hungry for the thought provoking extrapolation and rigorous technical detail of old fashioned hard sf are sure to enjoy astronomer brothertons first novel
8489634 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8489635 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8489636 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8489637 delaware can get another senator but you cant get another father

8489641 but even if your policy includes rentals there may be costs it doesnt cover
8489642 for example the rental company may well use a more expensive way of calculating vehicle damage than your auto policy and you might be stuck paying the difference
8489643 most alarmingly rental car companies frequently charge for diminished value the loss of resale value because of damage to the vehicle typically not covered by auto policies such charges of 5 000 to 8 000 are not uncommon

8489646 this shows this is the right path people are responding to that
8489647 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8489648 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8489649 you always want to see the big league team do well
8489650 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8489651 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8489652 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8489653 i think the race will come down to the end

8489660 for me one of the most important messages she said is this election isnt about her candidacy its about the values and the initiative i felt that signaled that she was going to release her delegates
8489661 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

8489663 removing life vests from airplanes to save fuel is like making cars more fuel efficient by removing seat belts

8489665 who is going to fly an airline with fewer safety features
8489666 in my experience its unusual to have so many suspects
8489667 if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly theres no role for me in the new south wales parliament

8489674 not a weed to be despised but for me a welcome and glorious flower that colored my world
8489675 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8489676 the argument must go beyond legality we can unite americans heal this nation help women and save babies
8489677 republicans have eroded the notion that government can do anything with one exception values
8489678 from those who support a womans right to choose and from those who believe that life begins at conception and must be defended at all cost
8489679 we need to take care of women who are pregnant and children who are born
8489680 i want all children to be born dont abandon these children in the delivery room
8489681 we need to protect life not from conception to birth but from conception to natural death
8489682 democrats need a lot of work on the first nine months but republicans have a lot more work to do from birth to natural death
8489683 the president looked at me and said heath that is the answer
8489684 if youre not helping a pregnant woman and youre not trying to help her youre not pro life
8489685 and the ethnic group that is hurting the most is the one that supports your party the most
8489686 admonished her followers not to put their affection for her over the issues when she reproved them for thinking for even a moment that her historic thrilling campaign was more important that the real campaign to defeat the republicans
8489687 where any of her followers could have gotten the idea doesnt seem to have crossed her mind
8489688 she never once said the truth which is that any hillary supporter who doesnt understand this issue alone is the reason to vote for obama has no business pretending to be a democrat
8489689 italics added that is the moral imperative for voting for barack obama forget about iraq gas prices the environment health care focus on 1 2 million abortions per year
8489690 lose focus on the issues and try ing to make me out to be a risky scary guy
8489691 now i must say i dont find myself particularly scary or particularly risky
8489692 my great friend one of the kings of comedy bernie mac
8489693 told bernie mac that he doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
8489694 is going to win the 2016 olympics and paralympics and your senator hes winning too
8489695 im just going to be able to walk over there i might have to rent out my house i dont know how much its going to be worth and i also in the interest of full disclosure i have to let you know that in 2016 ill be wrapping up my second term as president
8489696 i asked him to do it because he was the only person that i could trust to read all 150 000 pages in the code of federal regulations
8489697 i am so overexposed i make paris hilton look like a recluse
8489698 swept mr favreaus beloved red sox three games to none in their american league 2005 division series

8489701 you cant find a job unless you are a really really good basketball player which most of you brothers are not i know you think you are but youre not
8489702 you are overrated in your own mind you will not play in the nba you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next little wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
8489703 laughs at his own jokes a staccato heh that sounds naked when spoken into a mic in a large auditorium
8489704 the political cable news shows were filled with liberal pundits liberal anchors liberal guest historians liberal weather gals and guys liberal news you can use chicks liberal political strategists i e out of work democratic national committee gofers
8489705 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8489706 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8489707 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8489708 ghana being a tropical country the effect of climate change can be twofold
8489709 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8489710 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8489711 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut
8489712 please tell us about the ford arrangement is it true that reagan is giving ford total control of foreign policy
8489713 huh what whaddya mean its bush we all know its ford
8489714 page page excuse me page would you come over here
8489715 i dont know how ill do it sir but wait right here
8489716 ill get the message to mr ellis but it might take 20 minutes to get there and back
8489717 we came out today and gave away one cheap goal then we didnt want to defend didnt want to do much and the wheels fell off
8489718 they dont know how to fight back after getting down one or two goals
8489719 at the end they just wanted to get real sloppy with their tackles
8489720 they have to lower their perception to what their ability is
8489721 we have to go back and work harder than everybody else they know what to do but they are not putting it out on the field
8489722 if the score is tied at the end of the game lets just call it quits at least it was close
8489723 i couldnt be happy because we were getting blown up
8489724 tyrell was part of that he made some good reads and good throws
8489725 we were down 21 14 late in the fourth quarter and we had 80 yards to go to score
8489726 but we dont close the door on anybody every position on the team is decided by a week by week basis
8489727 i took it hard me being a leader and making two big mistakes but luckily our defense stopped them
8489728 typically we dont have a whole lot of freshmen playing varsity
8489729 we were in a position that we needed a backup quarterback and he had performed very well at the jv level
8489730 eu sempre confiei neles para mim n o foi surpresa alguma o que aconteceu no ltimo jogo com o s o paulo sim foi anormal pois mostramos oportunidades mas n o conseguimos um bom resultado
8489731 nosso time mostrou que uma equipe aguerrida hoje eles mostraram que podem jogar um futebol diferente mais efetivo
8489732 esquecer esta partida e esquecer a sul americana porque a gente saiu fora eu acho que a gente tem que pensar no brasileiro porque o pr ximo domingo mais importante
8489733 chega de tomar goleada acho que a sexta j no ano do centen rio o torcedor fica p por isto a gente tamb m fica chateado
8489734 neste momento a gente tem que procurar falar menos porque no momento da derrota f cil achar culpados acho que os culpados somos todos n s jogadores
8489735 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8489736 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8489737 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8489738 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8489739 sobra para n s a decep o da elimina o aqui na sul americana ainda por cima com este resultado mas ao menos isso nos dar condi es de seguir no campeonato brasileiro como uma campanha melhor pois teremos tempo para isso
8489740 eu coloquei o que eu achava melhor do que disp nhamos no momento mas n o pudemos contar com jogadores importantes o botafogo foi s bio e soube aproveitar as jogadas de contra ataque
8489741 n s nos empenhamos o tempo todo e ficamos em cima do atl tico a molecada est de parab ns n o f cil estrearem v rios jogadores na mesma equipe titular o s o paulo tem uma garotada muito boa e vai colher frutos
8489742 o modo que eu bato e geralmente a bola entra infelizmente hoje quarta n o entrou seria importante para os garotos passarem mas eles mostraram o valor mais uma vez em um jogo dif cil o s o paulo tem muitos frutos a colher
8489743 n s viemos pra esse jogo com muitas expectativas otimistas para conseguir a vaga para a pr xima fase desde o momento que definimos que vir amos com for a m xima significava que vir amos para sair de campo com a classifica o
8489744 agora vamos colocar nosso foco no campeonato brasileiro e na v spera do jogo na col mbia vamos definir a equipe mas o pensamento ir com uma equipe forte e trazer um bom resultado para o jogo no engenh o para termos condi es de passar para as quartas
8489745 i have admired joe biden for years especially when he wrote the basis for the law strengthening the rights of abused and stalked women his personal story proves his concern for families and surviving hard and difficult times his long experience on the judicial and armed services committees is is invaluable the fact his son is going to iraq will resonate with all the service families and proud americans nothing silver spoon about this team
8489746 of course theyve realized it a whole lot more than some but these are two men who are passionate about public service men who have dedicated their entire lives to public service and theyve been justly compensated not only for their devotion to america but their personal book sales books that were full of substance not justifications for so many past behaviors that are the exact opposite of what america calls family values
8489747 the cutaways to the clintons were quite revealing both bill and hillary seemed genuinely happy honestly and fully present in the moment
8489748 and obamas surprise appearance set just the right note for closing tonights session he was casual relaxed and a little funny
8489749 the icing on the cake was the onstage appearance of bidens entire family including his adorable mother it was a brilliant maneuver but i expect brilliance from this campaign
8489750 would love to help you buddy but only our team leader can speak
8489751 not every single member of our coalition have endorsed obama
8489752 vetoing more bills than any other president in united states history
8489753 people think that scientists exist to instruct them poets and musicians etc to give them pleasure that the latter have something to teach them never occurs to them
8489754 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8489755 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8489756 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8489757 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8489758 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8489759 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8489760 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8489761 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8489762 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8489763 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8489764 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8489765 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8489766 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8489767 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8489768 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8489769 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8489770 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8489771 with eyes fixed on the future and the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8489772 if the new york delegation can swallow it everyone else can too
8489773 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8489774 it will be an accomplishment when a woman graduates first in her class at west point and nobody notices
8489775 youre only still in the running because youre a girl if you were a guy your eyesight wouldve disqualified you long ago
8489776 im still in the running because i have fabulous sats better than a 4 0 gpa and im in a ton of extracurriculars and in leadership positions in half of them
8489777 no i was delegated the senior ood because i kick butt on the bridge thank you very much
8489778 vote for hillary because shes a woman or for obama because hes black and the country is
8489779 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8489780 so when do you think the u s will have a woman president
8489781 when you have a woman whos qualified for the job obviously
8489782 this guy drives a bus like hes driving a rickshaw
8489783 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8489784 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8489785 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8489786 ive been fortunate to have a loyal group of assistant coaches
8489787 ive been fortunate that my coaches like each other they dont let their egos get out of control they dont care whether we win 3 0 or 49 48 as long as we win
8489788 he got left here completely by himself he had to go hire nine brand new guys
8489789 its been perfect hes as good a football coach as there is anywhere and even a better person grobe said hes got a great family my whole coaching staff just loves him it was just an easy fit
8489790 when i first arrived at ohio we didnt have much in the way of facilities
8489791 i think our staff did a good job just going in and worrying about football we didnt worry about what we didnt have we tried to take what we did have which was a great school and a popular school
8489792 some of our losing seasons we were actually 5 3 in the mac but ended up with a losing record because we played three heavies grobe said sometimes we would play three major teams outside the mac and end up with 5 6 record
8489793 its a one stop shop for anyone looking for equipping and encouragement as they continue to grow themselves in whatever facet of life their in
8489794 ive been a member for seven months and this is like another family im just so happy i found these people to come to
8489795 temos uma surpresa para voc s teremos um convidado especial esta noite
8489796 what caused it to happen and how his arms were involved is something well find out when we look more closely into it
8489797 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8489798 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8489799 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times
8489800 have tabled an economic agenda that stands diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
8489801 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word
8489802 god willing and with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance to succeed
8489803 if this had been easy somebody would have solved it a long time ago
8489804 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial
8489805 this is the first time we practiced in the heat today we got out and it got hot we could tell our kids got wilted about half way through practice it is very obvious we could play in a ball game about this hot
8489806 somebody else has got to play now someone else is going to line up there it may be myron rolle but someone will be there
8489807 it felt pretty good today it started off a little sore in the beginning but its something you have to work through warm up a little bit and then its fine after
8489808 la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado los recursos del impuesto directo de los hidrocarburos y autonom as son temas susceptibles de ser allanado mediante procedimiento civilizados no a trav s del insulto y los golpes
8489809 quienes quieren practicar violencia en bolivia es porque le tienen miedo al intelecto a la raz n y a defender sus ideales mediante el di logo y no la soberbia
8489810 quiero agradecerle en nombre del gobierno municipal de el alto compa ero hermano de la rep blica de cuba por el trabajo que a realizado durante este tiempo esto merece el cari o el reconocimiento por siempre a nuestros hermanos y hermanas cubanas igualmente agradecer a los asesores facilitadores
8489811 cuando un cubano viene a esta ciudad nos sentimos como en nuestra casa porque ustedes al igual que nosotros estamos de pie nunca de rodillas y decirles tambi n que nos sentimos muy orgullosos de trabajar y colaborar con ustedes porque ustedes han cambiado la historia de este pa s
8489812 tal vez antes nos enga aban compa eros pero ahora ya no nosotros tambi n vamos a tomar el poder
8489813 no conozco la escuela no ten amos plata y por eso mis madres no me metieron a la escuela pero ahora ya he aprendiendo aunque me falta mejorar quiero seguir aprehendiendo
8489814 jvais tre franc et honn te jte quitte jai trouv mieux ailleurs
8489815 he reached back when he needed it he was a consistent 94 and 95 miles an hour then reaches back and throws 97 up in the zone and thats hard to catch up to not many people can dial it up to 97
8489816 if there was something wrong with him before there is certainly nothing wrong with him now
8489817 i made a mistake to pence for the second time in a row
8489818 he got me when we played in cincinnati too it was a 2 0 changeup in cincinnati and a hanging curve today he is a good hitter and he did what he is supposed to do with those
8489819 when you are pitching against a guy like roy oswalt you have to be pretty good because he was one of the premier guys in the league his track record is that he is going to put up zeros
8489820 i dont think roy cruises or anything but he really showed me what he has on that at bat
8489821 after the last pitch he gave me a little stare and i kind of got goosebumps because i love competition it was awesome even though i lost
8489822 he has almost no fear and has really good stuff and that combination leads to a lot of success
8489823 i wasnt around for about 21 of those wins of his but tonight he looked like one of the best pitchers in baseball
8489824 at the time i had no idea what export control data was
8489825 it was a dream for me coming here i came here primarily because of dr roth
8489826 this is what dr roth told me to do tell the truth he said the purpose of scientific research is truth
8489827 he told me to tell the truth or they would send me back to iran
8489828 my complaint is over what i consider to be cavalier and grossly unethical treatment i received at the hands of mr thomas strickland
8489829 i believe this incident constitutes official misconduct as defined in the ethics committee policy
8489830 allowed no discussion and did not ask whether there were questions or motions from the floor
8489831 it boils down to one allegation the treatment he received at the commission meeting at the hand of the chair
8489832 he says its a violation of the ethics code he does not believe he received proper treatment from the commission his complaint is that he was embarrassed that he was humiliated that commission did not listen to his address
8489833 his complaint comes nowhere near being a violation of the statute i dont think anything the chair did warrants being charged with a class e felony
8489834 i think its just not a valid complaint i moved him up early because i did not want him to wait i gave him five minutes and nobody had any questions
8489835 i think when you see the tape youre going to see there is no violation here
8489836 this isnt question and answer time you had your five minutes
8489837 i think when you see the tape youre going to see there is no violation here
8489838 we will continue to focus attention on motorists who persist in breaking the law and endangering the lives of our citizens
8489839 we will have adequate numbers of officers to ensure everybody will have a good time
8489840 well have a sufficient number of officers on the ground and on the river both of our police boats will be in operation
8489841 from the standpoint of stretching the police force we actually caught a break with tennessee playing in california
8489842 it looks like theres a lot of things theyre concerned about
8489843 they want to get it done as fast as possible theyre going beyond what we asked them to investigate theyve been ordered to expedite it it really sounds good for the taxpayers of knox county
8489844 were happy its in the hands of the attorney general we have every confidence hes going to do the right thing and were glad its in the hands of someone who has the authority to finalize it as far as commissioners pinkston and defreese are concerned their actions and reputations speak for themselves
8489845 i have confidence this is in the right hands i think justice will prevail i am excited to see whats happening there is an incredible amount of people working on this im confident they will get to the bottom of this
8489846 looking for witnesses and reviewing an incredible amount of documents
8489847 the complaint centered on perceived continuing corruption in the knox county mayors office
8489848 were happy its in the hands of the attorney general we have every confidence hes going to do the right thing and were glad its in the hands of someone who has the authority to finalize it
8489849 the margin in the fourth quarter was a bit shaky
8489850 but you dont invest in holcim on a three month basis its a long term investment as infrastructure and emerging markets are mega trends
8489851 in a favorable but increasingly challenging economic environment the groups fundamental strengths were in full view
8489852 the tight situation on the real estate market will affect conditions in the u s construction sector in 2008 as well
8489853 it is clearly better positioned than lafarge with its strong foothold in india
8489854 temos uma surpresa para voc s teremos um convidado especial esta noite
8489855 bill clinton um exemplo de presidente que tem o povo como sua prioridade
8489856 nosso pa s menos seguro e est mais isolado agora do que em qualquer outro momento na hist ria recente
8489857 devemos acreditar em john mccain que diz n o se deve criar um prazo para a retirada das tropas do iraque ou devemos escutar barack obama que diz que devemos transferir a responsabilidade aos iraquianos e fixar um calend rio para trazer nossas tropas de combate para casa
8489858 barack obama e eu seguimos caminhos muito diferentes para chegar a este destino mas compartilhamos uma hist ria comum
8489859 essa a am rica que george w bush nos deixou e esse o futuro que nos oferecer john mccain
8489860 is the top end of towns self important evening of adulation for a man with whom the nearest thing they have in common is that he was a stockbroker in adelaide
8489861 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8489862 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8489863 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8489864 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8489865 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8489866 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8489867 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8489868 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8489869 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8489870 is proposing to use the government to remake economic policies in a way that hasnt been seen in washington in decades
8489871 this plan will allow the division to improve the timeliness of our customer services while operating more efficiently
8489872 i can assure you that my son was not in that car
8489873 he could pass every type of lie detector test he was at his girlfriends house and then they got a bite to eat i challenge anyone in the west warwick police department to say he was in that car
8489874 i can understand why they asked they wanted us to look at it because they think based on local politics that its a hot potato
8489875 they said that alves son and the former chiefs daughter were in the car and allegedly involved in the chicanery
8489876 we cant be in the business of handling local cities and towns political squabbles or wed spend all our time doing that
8489877 all of a sudden my son is the number one villain with the west warwick police department
8489878 they put two detectives on this over two signs that were returned within the hour i have to question the judgment of the west warwick police leadership to help perpetrate a political vendetta
8489879 she refused to tell him who else was in the vehicle with her
8489880 has been muddied on both sides by the theft of political signs and so forth
8489881 i think we have some people who might say we didnt get this or we didnt get that chalkboards new electrical outlets
8489882 certainly it wasnt a total renovation that everything was torn apart and rebuilt
8489883 es la primera piedra de lo que puede venir para los jaliscienses involucrados en la producci n de cine
8489884 con la creaci n del fideicomiso los empresarios podr n invertir con mucha m s confianza a las producciones cinematogr ficas en jalisco
8489885 el fideicomiso era nuestra meta m s a orada y esperamos que antes de que finalice el a o se lance la convocatoria
8489886 no puedo dejar de reconocer que esa empresa cultural llamada feria internacional del libro es orgullo de todos los jaliscienses me comprometo a que permanezca la feria internacional del libro pero no me comprometo a que permanezca ra l padilla l pez al frente de la misma todos los ciclos inician y tienen que cerrarse sin embargo a n no he tomado una determinaci n
8489887 quiero garantizarle a todos los jaliscienses y a todos los mexicanos porque est n saliendo estas notas a nivel nacional que la feria internacional del libro le debe mucho de su xito a ra l padilla l pez pero no depende de ra l padilla l pez es de la universidad de guadalajara
8489888 voy a revisar el asunto conjuntamente con el presidente del corporativo y evaluar citar a la directora de la feria internacional del libro nubia mac as para que me informe no estoy enterado d nde ser n los homenajes al escritor
8489889 la universidad de guadalajara no est en condiciones de seguir aportando recursos para algo que no representa beneficio para la universidad
8489890 nosotros somos una empresa parauniversitaria que tiene un compromiso con la iniciativa privada muy grande en el sentido de la parte comercial las operaciones contin an normalmente aunque por supuesto estamos atentos a lo que est ocurriendo en la universidad
8489891 ha sido separado de momento del consejo de administraci n de empresas universitarias claramente contin a siendo el presidente de la fil en plenas funciones y nosotros esperamos que todo siga caminando bien
8489892 el presidente y secretario del fideicomiso ra l padilla y laura puebla respectivamente s se designan por la universidad a trav s del rector pero en tanto el consejo no instruya al rector del cambio y en tanto el comit no sesione no puede haber cambios no hay forma de que esto suceda hasta que el cgu no decida el cambio
8489893 ser a lamentable que lo que hemos construido con apoyo de gobiernos e instituciones privadas est en peligro por una situaci n de esta naturaleza
8489894 a lo que no me comprometo es a que permanezca ra l padilla l pez al frente
8489895 de manera efectiva sobre la base de una agenda y una metodolog a precisas
8489896 poca flexibilidad y con escasa apertura a encontrar puntos de coincidencia

8489899 we want to send what is needed where its needed
8489900 it used to be that you either worked with companies or against them
8489901 but thats foolish and a false choice we help companies change but we dont take no for an answer
8489902 moving 6 or 7 of their catalogs to recycled paper is to be applauded but the remaining 350 million need to change
8489903 we have been good environmental stewards and we recognize there is more to be done
8489904 in the internet age printing catalogs at this volume is like running cars on a steam engine
8489905 i believe a company like ours should be a source for good for us for our communities for the world

8489911 el gobierno convoc permanentemente al di logo y por ello hacemos votos para que en las horas siguientes y con la presencia de cualquier instituci n se de inicio al coloquio
8489912 el pa s requiere soluciones inmediatas y el poder ejecutivo no puede estar supeditado al capricho de intereses mezquinos de los prefectos de la media luna y menos a intereses subterr neos que se encubren con el pretexto de autonom a
8489913 para nosotros siempre ha sido una obsesi n hemos enviado reiteradas cartas al presidente de la rep blica a la iglesia cat lica hemos solicitado a los pa ses amigos a la comunidad internacional para que creen el espacio donde se puedan generar los consensos
8489914 nosotros creemos que el idh las autonom as y la nueva constituci n son elementos fundamentales de un proceso de acercamiento y no hay que poner condiciones
8489915 hay una gran intransigencia de parte del mas y una gran intransigencia de parte de la media luna y no pueden los dos extremos del pa s apretar y asfixiar al estado

8489925 the number of kayakers has increased over the years and with improved skills and better equipment being made people are able to go into many streams that werent attempted popularly before
8489926 its amazing when we have rain episodes how quickly the water will rise and then it will recede just as quickly when the rain stops
8489927 they were going to take out before the west prong but he continued on

8489949 his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
8489950 all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like

8489975 the new york times reports that these differences can all bold added be attributed to human caused climate change using the case of atlanta as an illustration
8489976 a scientific consensus has concluded that this warming trend has largely been caused by the human production of heat trapping gases

8489986 egypts wheat production is primarily in winter btw wheat wont produce well in egypts summmer weather too hot

8489988 as far as the noaa issue goes the use of a baseline to calculate temperatue anomalies relates to the issue of what is meant by anomaly
8489989 65 ike thanks for the clarification the choice of base period for looking at anomalies makes no scientific difference which may be what you are getting at it does as you suggest convey a perceptual difference when the graphs are displayed so were i a political strategist id suggest using an older period to emphasize trends and a newer period to downplay them such a decision necessarily must be made on nonscientific factors there is no purely scientific answer to the question of what baseline to use
8489990 the eu faces the additional constraint that it can increase production for export only if it can export without subsidies a key question is therefore whether market conditions will be such as to make possible unsubsidized exports
