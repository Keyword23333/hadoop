4580002 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4580003 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4580004 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4580005 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4580006 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4580007 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4580023 the idea strange as it may appear never occurred to them the indians that they were suffering for the great cause of civilization which in the natural course of things must exterminate indians
4580024 i had to lock the indian women and men together in a large room to prevent them from returning to their homes in the mountains at night large numbers deserted during the daytime
4580025 my grandfather was enslaved by sutter to help in building the fort while he was kept there sutter worked him hard and then fed him in troughs as soon as he could he escaped with his family and hid in the mountains
4580026 the indians of california make as obedient and humble slaves as the negro in the south for a mere trifle you can secure their services for life
4580027 the gold was very bad medicine it belonged to a demon who devoured all who searched for it
4580028 a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the indian race becomes extinct
4580029 we hope that the government will render such aid as will enable the citizens of the north to carry on a war of extermination until the last redskin of these tribes has been killed extermination is no longer a question of time the time has arrived the work has commenced and let the first man who says treaty or peace be regarded as a traitor
4580030 the california valley cannot grace her annals with a single indian war bordering on respectability it can however boast a hundred or two of as brutal butchering on the part of our honest miners and brave pioneers as any area of equal extent in our republic
4580031 he was not interested in the matter of taking the children
4580032 it was an act of charity on the part of thr two to hunt up the children and then provide homes for them because their parents had been killed and the children would have perished with hunger
4580033 but it is from these mountain tribes that white settlers draw their supplies of kidnapped children educated as servants and women for purposes of labor and lust there are parties in the northern portion of the state whose sole occupation has been to steal young children and squaws and dispose of them at handsome prices to the settlers who willingly pay 50 or 60 for a young digger to cook or wait upon them or 100 for a likely young girl
4580034 the attacking party rushed upon them blowing out their brains and splitting their heads open with tomahawks little children in baskets and even babes had their heads smashed to pieces or cut open mothers and infants shared the same phenomenon many of the fugitives were chased or shot as they ran the children scarcely able to run toddled toward the squaws for protection crying with fright but were overtaken slaughtered like wild animals and thrown into piles

4580049 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4580050 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the pre season flows so differently that you dont know how long the defence is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4580051 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4580052 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4580053 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4580054 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4580055 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way

4580073 time is not a concept its a word and like any word it can be manipulated according to ones subjective state just like quantum mechanics and relativity are unified in that they require perception to create reality every passing trice can be toiled at ones will or against ones will

4580076 if everybody could understand the horrors of substance abuse we might be able to save a life if we can save one life thats why we are here
4580077 what has been quite shocking even for the researchers is the frankness with which some respondents said that there are teenage girls and boys using drugs like marijuana cocaine and speed this is alarming as it was always thought that the girls in particular of stamford hill were totally immune from such terrible things
4580078 the growing social acceptability of these substances and the ease of obtaining them would suggest that this has the danger of mushrooming into a far greater problem
4580079 i love your office mama its really messy but everything in it is exciting
4580080 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
4580081 it would not work as the only thing to do
4580082 het ontbreekt ons aan de meest primaire herinneringen zelfs mijn eerste gedachte kan ik mij niet herinneren
4580083 als het om het verstrijken van de tijd gaat staan ons nog de wonderlijkste ontdekkingen te wachten
4580084 de clubs zijn geprofessionaliseerde bureaucratie n die het actierepertoire hebben ingeruild voor de onderhandelingstafel echt actief is nog maar een kleine minderheid en radicale acties worden nauwelijks nog uitgevoerd
4580085 zon inbraak past volstrekt rationeel in die tijd de openbaarheid was twintig jaar geleden veel minder
4580086 onderzoek naar mogelijke locaties gaat door maar in alle openheid een alert kamerlid kan waarschijnlijk net zoveel informatie boven water krijgen al moet je de vraag stellen hoeveel alerte leden de kamer telt
4580087 liefst op het allerhoogste niveau maar als het niet opschiet lopen we wel eens voorbij een bordje verboden toegang
4580088 als we aan het unilever kantoor hangen met een kettingzaag van papier mach dan merk je dat er een verklaring komt over het tegengaan van bomenkap voor de winning van palmolie terwijl zes jaar onderhandelen niets heeft opgeleverd
4580089 wij hebben speciale trainingen in geweldloos actievoeren hoe je in een confrontatie met bulldozers en boze werknemers voorkomt dat je klappen krijgt wat je lichaamshouding moet zijn om een zaak te de scaleren
4580090 radicale activisten heb je altijd gehad en er zijn groepen die genetisch gemodificeerde maisvelden kapot maken maar daar hebben de grote organisaties zich nooit mee beziggehouden wij doen aan beleidsbe nvloeding het is essentieel dat de stevige milieuambities van het kabinet gevolgd worden door strengere normen hogere belastingen en accijnzen voor vervuilende vliegtuigen en autos
4580091 niemand wil in een vervuilende auto rijden maar als je al 300 keuzes op een dag maakt heb je geen zin om ook nog uit te zoeken welke auto het zuinigst is of welke groente het beste de consument moet ervan uit kunnen gaan dat wat in de winkel ligt gewoon goed is mensen dragen geen autogordel omdat ze dat goed voor ze is maar omdat er ooit een verplichting kwam daarom pleiten wij bijvoorbeeld voor een klimaatwet zodat de uitstoot van co2 elk jaar afneemt
4580092 een convenant moet niet in de plaats komen van regelgeving zoals de overheid nogal eens denkt wij stellen met bedrijven actieplannen op wij laten zien dat er bedrijven en sectoren zijn die wel willen zoals de glastuinbouw met wie we afspreken hoeveel co2 ze gaan reduceren
4580093 milieudefensie is heel principieel ze wijst de hele maasvlakte af omdat daarmee het verkeer en de uitstoot van broeikasgassen toenemen en ze wijst ook op de internationale economische systeem dat verbeteringen in de weg staat natuurmonumenten is vooral gericht op zijn eigen terreinen
4580094 ik doe al een hele tijd onderzoek en kom steeds meer tot de conclusie dat de verschillende vormen elkaar versterken door buitenparlementaire acties alleen krijg je geen politieke veranderingen maar het geeft onderhandelende clubs makkelijker een voet tussen de deur
4580095 niemand vindt het nog normaal om kernafval in zee te dumpen steeds meer consumenten vragen naar duurzaam hout en voedsel voorzichtig komt er een aantal zeereservaten waardoor de visstand zich wat kan herstellen de walvispopulatie groeit weer maar of we de klimaatveranderingen kunnen tegengaan staat of valt met politici die hun rug recht houden en het bedrijfsleven zal ambitie moeten tonen
4580096 het milieubewustzijn is groot maar als je ziet wat er zou moeten gebeuren dan lijkt de situatie tamelijk hopeloos de mondiale uitstoot van broeikasgassen zal drastisch omlaag moeten we moeten toe naar minder autos en vliegverkeer
4580097 wij volwassenen bekijken het vanuit een helikopter view wij weten wat een grote stap het is om voor het eerst naar de basisschool te gaan en hoe moeilijk het kan zijn voor een kind is het heel normaal iedereen gaat broertjes zusjes buurkinderen het is een gegeven net als het regent jij brengt emotie en zwaarte in het kind niet
4580098 natuurlijk is het kind verlegen zal het het misschien moeilijk vinden om afscheid te nemen van papa of mama moe zijn van alle indrukken ik adviseer ouders om naast de wenprocedure die de school hanteert ook de schoolgang langzaam op te bouwen eerst het kind een of twee weken alleen s ochtends laten gaan ook het overblijven en de naschoolse opvang langzaam opbouwen probeer er na schooltijd niet te veel omheen te plannen niet ook nog het kind op zwemles doen of het iedere dag bij de nieuwe vriendjes laten spelen maar het gewoon rustig thuis laten zijn zodat het alle indrukken kan verwerken
4580099 dus we gaan samen naar school dan lees ik nog een boekje dan zwaai ik bij de deur en dan ga ik weg en houd je daar ook aan ga niet dralen als het kind huilt in negen van de tien keer is het binnen drie minuten over en als dat niet zo is belt de school echt wel
4580100 wanneer ouders er iets heel belangrijks van maken kan dit het kind zenuwachtig maken het moet wel een natuurlijke stap in de ontwikkeling blijven een beetje spannend maar vooral ook leuk
4580101 ouders moeten er alert op zijn dat ze hun eigen onzekerheden en angsten van vroeger niet overbrengen op hun kind nog voordat het de kans heeft gekregen eigen ervaringen op te doen een ouder die vroeger veel is gepest kan geneigd zijn het eigen kind hier op voor te bereiden door bijvoorbeeld te zeggen dat het zich er niets van moet aantrekken als iemand hem of haar uitscheldt een kind kan dan al bij voorbaat een angst ontwikkelen voor pesten
4580102 het is goed voor het zelfvertrouwen van het kind wanneer het bepaalde vaardigheden al geleerd heeft bij het starten op school
4580103 een kind dat naar de middelbare school gaat kun je als ouder niet meer aan de hand nemen
4580104 niet letterlijk maar ook niet figuurlijk het kind moet gestimuleerd worden het zelf te doen en hier ook de verantwoordelijkheid voor te nemen al speel je als ouder op de achtergrond natuurlijk nog wel een begeleidende en beschermende rol
4580105 de eerste periode kunnen ouders wel wat extra alert zijn op hoe het gaat op school maar dit moet niet te duidelijk zijn voor kinderen ze kunnen dan het idee krijgen dat ouders denken dat ze het niet aankunnen en dat is niet goed voor hun zelfvertrouwen
4580106 voor zowel ouders als het kind is de aanloopperiode naar de middelbare school heftig eerst de spanning van de citotoets waar toch veel aan opgehangen wordt dan het kiezen van een school waarbij het nog maar de vraag is of je wordt toegelaten en of er plek is wij hebben als ouders geprobeerd lucht te brengen in die spanning door bijvoorbeeld te zeggen dat een citotoets niet allesbepalend is voor hoe jij bent als mens en voor wat je talenten zijn
4580107 de derde keer wilde hij zelf op de terugweg is hij verdwaald en heeft hij aan een betrouwbaar ogende man de weg gevraagd we hebben hem gecomplimenteerd met hoe hij het heeft opgelost
4580108 als jij het niet doet wie doet het d n

4580115 a pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties
4580116 i hope that people start noticing that ifpi gets more and more into bed with the police its really disturbing that one side of an ongoing fight gets more authority without a legal basis
4580117 this decision sends out a clear message that the pirate bays activities are illegal under italian law the pirate bay facilitates the mass infringement of copyright across music film television and games its very name shows the contempt its operators hold for the creators of legitimate content

4580124 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4580125 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4580126 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4580127 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father

4580149 spacious melodic dub electronica heyoka has a deeply psychedelic sound full of squelches blips sonic flickers and all manner of effected sine waves corrosive synthetics and acidic programming driven by huge lumbering bass lines and gritty programmed drumtracks pineal dub draws on elements of idm glitch downtempo and displaced hip hop binding them up into a consistent dub framework with a very low centre of gravity

4580154 were just trying to take care of the debts and the employees in an orderly fashion so bill roper ceo of flagship studios and one or two other people have stuck around and are doing their best to get that done
4580155 were proceeding under the assumption that were not going to be able to get myhtos or proceed on it
4580156 because of the nature of how the ip is being held and the technology being held separately it seems safer and better for us to proceed as if were really not going to have any avenue to work with it
4580157 we were in very advanced negotiations with a couple of people for deals that would have kept flagship open and would have kept everything running
4580158 and in fact for a good while it was looking like a near certainty that one of those would have come to fruition
4580159 to the last minute and actually beyond the last minute i know that negotiations were going on to try and make sure that we could get the studio back on track
4580160 primarily we just all proceeded here like we were going to be releasing our open beta in october and kept working until the last minute

4580163 the main reason that serious content providers or laborers such as plaintiff provide content to youtube com at all

4580166 he was a little rusty on defense we have two more preseason games that id like for him to return some especially at home

4580169 first of all this girl could not possibly tell the difference between russian and georgian bombs i doubt this 12 year old girl is a balistics expert and can recognize georgian artillery so her claim that the russian troops were saviors and georgian troops were viciously bombing her is balogney secondly this girl is russian her name is kokoeva her aunt has a russian accent its pretty clear that creates some serious bias in her speech which sounded extremely choreographed
4580170 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4580171 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4580172 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4580173 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4580174 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4580175 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4580176 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4580177 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4580178 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4580181 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4580182 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4580183 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4580184 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4580185 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4580186 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4580187 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4580188 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off
4580189 they had a couple of drinks on them they were extremely aggressive one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartments

4580193 when michael walked into the door here at towson high school he had a dream and his dream was to raise the status of swimming and to go to the olympics
4580194 hes just amazing its so cool to see somebody who lives eight blocks away from me and i can see him on tv winning in something as big as the olympics its just awesome
4580195 i had to go to the pool that day all my friends were going it was the last day of school and michael drove me there in his escalade when i came up everyone was like michael phelps hes here then i got out of the car and it was really exciting

4580221 as a nurse and a midwife i am appalled by david brittens actions and that they went unchecked for so long
4580222 he abused not just these women but also his position of professional trust

4580224 i wont say it drowns the noise out but it kind of pushes it further into the background so you can listen to something that is pleasing rather than listening to the conversation through the wall

4580407 the drug companies know that this administration will do nothing to them there is no fear of the fda with this culture with laissez faire oversight and regulation i think they should be gone if we get rid of them it will put the drug companies on notice
4580408 last year this nations regulatory failures resulted in dead dogs and cats this year it has tragically led to the deaths of people
4580409 if we dont make some rapid progress on fixing the foreign drug inspection program the next melamine or heparin tragedy will soon be upon us
4580410 is partially responsible for the decline in ssri prescription use and the corresponding increase in adolescent suicide
4580411 ssri s have not been proven effective in treating adolescent depression to the contrary their use may actually increase the suicide rate of its young patients
4580412 in response to these reports of increased suicide rates with ssri use fda officials suppressed their own post marketing surveillance prohibited fda employees from discussing the report and launched an investigation to find the person who leaked information to the press today ssris remain on the market without a clear medical benefit to the patient
4580413 there should be a black box warning around everything stupak says regarding medicines
4580414 particularly ssris which have been shown to benefit patients and are associated with a decline in suicides
4580415 dr healy recently testified at the fda hearing on antidepressants he is a psychiatry professor at cardiff university in wales but also according to the new york times has worked for plaintiffs lawyers in cases brought against pharmaceutical companies thats transparency
4580416 when i served as associate commissioner at the fda dr healy visited with me but he never mentioned that he worked for the tort bar
4580417 when i went into the fda to meet with peter pitts i made no efforts to conceal my links to trial attorneys some of whom were at the meeting and no efforts were made to conceal my links to the pharmaceutical industry all of which were well known
4580418 because in my experience republicans such as senator grassley and staffers working for them such as emilia desanto have appeared more concerned about and more effective on the issue than anyone else and as a republican appointee i thought peter pitts heart might be in the right place
4580419 what was not well known at the time was that peter pitts was transiting between working for pharmaceutical companies or perhaps not even transiting
4580420 im not sure how many of us would have felt it worth going if we had known his background
4580421 it seems astonishing to me now that with people like peter pitts in fda that it was ever possible to bring the suicidality issues to light
4580422 whose flawed study about ssris and suicide triggered a series of events which lead to less ssri use and more suicide
4580423 for his persistence zeal and determination to damage not only the fda but the public health for his effectiveness in fear mongering and willingness to subordinate medical progress to his ascetic view of safety
4580424 but he seems to spend a lot of time in the halls of congress advising members and staff about which fda medical reviewers should be hauled in for polite conversations
4580425 his assertion that avandia should be taken off the market
4580426 is best remembered in 2007 as the conduit for steve nissen s half baked meta analysis of avandia
4580427 helped blow out of all appropriate proportion fear about drug safety in general and avandia in particular
4580428 persistent undermining of the fda came close to winning him clipboard top honors for 2007
4580429 i wonder how much more money the senator will get from the trial lawyer lizards as a reward for such vituperative rants
4580430 members of congress and senior officials of the fda should be ashamed of themselves for giving graham the chance to not only rant on about vioxx and ssris but to make the same claims about ketek and drugs for schizophrenia

4580437 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
4580438 the short of it is that being athletic and being fit has its privileges
4580439 basically michael phelps metabolism is so fast that his metabolism needs an enormous amount of calories so eating 12 000 calories a day isnt an enormous amount of food compared to his metabolism
4580440 look at his physique and look at his performance and it speaks for itself
4580441 he is able to maintain recovery from each event such that he can win a gold medal in the next event or contribute to one and he can maintain a lean physique hes leaner than the average swimmer as well he looks to me from looking at the pictures to be 7 or 8 percent body fat
4580442 like lance armstrong these are athletes that are off the measurable scale for determining regular metabolic rate or physiological performance
4580443 these guys are at the extreme top so we cant apply average everyday physiology of a lay person to an elite athlete like these they are genetically gifted and trained

4580456 hes been around the training now for three or four days hes fitted comfortably into anything we can play
4580457 fabricio can play different positions he can play both sides of the centre back and he play left back and right back he can also play holding midfield that covers you in a lot of positions
4580458 that makes him a fantastic acquisition for me as manager because it means if we get an injury in a certain place i can use his experience and it wont faze him to play anywhere so this is a fantastic signing for us

4580462 we should not think of worship as confined to praise or a worship activity in a church house
4580463 n 1a homage or reverence paid to a deity b acts rites or ceremonies of worship 2 adoration or devotion worship of wealth v 1 tr adore as divine honor with religious rites 2 tr idolize 3 intr attend public service
4580464 n 1 chiefly british a person of importance used as a title for various officials as magistrates and some mayors 2 reverence offered to a divine being or supernatural power also an act of expressing such reverence 3 a form of religious practice with its creed and ritual 4 extravagant respect or admiration for or devotion to an object of esteem v 1 to honor or reverence as a divine being or supernatural power 2 to regard with great or extravagant respect honor or devotion intransitive senses to perform or take part in worship or an act of worship
4580465 through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of lips which make confession to his name
4580466 but to do good and to commune forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased
4580467 would you please comment on the difference between serving god and worshiping god
4580468 there is not nearly as much difference between these concepts as many today apparently believe occasionally we see over the entrance to a church auditorium these words enter to worship and leave to serve this concept results from ignorance of what the new testament teaches about service and worship to god
4580469 when for example a basket of food is carried to a needy family the act is grounded in the concept of service but it is done out of regard to our relationship to god and to this extent involves an act of worship

4580473 i think for most people in the south asian community this would come as a huge shock and a surprise as well
4580474 the women were not allowed to come and they were not allowed to come because canada did not want any permanent settlement of south asians so there were about only about five women who came
4580475 whats so funny about this 1915 trial is that you can see how hard the nascent municipal government was trying to associate these sikh males with homosexuality to the point where they were involved in very aggressive hands on entrapment
4580476 whether the acts they are accused of engaging in actually happened or not or were they fantasies of the police officers or whether there was an issue of the arrested individuals not being able to bribe police out of being arrested those are the great historical questions that we may never be able to answer

4580545 take care brothers lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief leading you to fall away from the living god
4580546 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hinder the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which is known of god is manifest in them for god manifested it unto them
4580547 for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen being perceived through the things that are made even his everlasting power and divinity that they may be without excuse
4580548 because that knowing god they glorified him not as god neither gave thanks but became vain in their reasonings and their senseless heart was darkened
4580549 and even as they refused to have god in their knowledge god gave them up unto a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting 29 being filled with all unrighteousness wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder strife deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters hateful to god insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection unmerciful 32 who knowing the ordinance of god that they that practice such things are worthy of death not only do the same but also consent with them that practice them
4580550 and this is the judgment that the light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil 20 for every one that does evil hates the light and comes not to the light lest his works should be reproved
4580551 they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them due to their hardness of heart 19 they have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality greedy to practice every kind of impurity

4580554 for when gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law 15 they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them 16 on that day when according to my gospel god judges the secrets of men by christ jesus
4580555 must all appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body whether good or evil
4580556 but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin 14 for we share in christ if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end
4580557 for the word of god is living and active sharper than any two edged sword piercing to the division of soul and of spirit of joints and of marrow and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart
4580558 such evidences like the existence of the conscience the fulfilled predictive prophecies of the scriptures the scientific foreknowledge of the scriptures the consistency in agreement of the writers of the scriptures the empty tomb lacking the body of jesus and pauls conversion have yet to be addressed
4580559 these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with you that everything written about me in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled

4580583 de democratische rechtsstaat is ons hoogste goed die hebben we te beschermen en te bewaken acties die de democratie ondermijnen zullen nooit door groenlinks worden gesteund of geaccepteerd mensen die het daarmee oneens zijn horen bij een partij met een ander standpunt
4580584 kraken is ook inbreken maar betekent dit dat alles wat buiten de wet is ook onacceptabel is ik vind van niet en ik denk dat veel andere mensen in de partij dat ook niet vinden
4580585 ik veroordeel die inbraak van wijnand in het ministerie van economische zaken niet gelijk het is niet dat hij dit lukraak deed hij is getipt bovendien ging het niet over de inbraak het ging over de stukken die hij openbaar wilde maken dat was een zaak van leven en dood

4580588 the challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
4580589 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
4580590 the waiver is required because under u s law any country that provides weapons or nuclear capabilities to countries like iran north korea and syria is prohibited from getting american technology or entering into any contract for american technology
4580591 it would be illegal for nasa unless they had a waiver to actually contract to use the soyuz to get to and from the space station
4580592 but that was before the hostilities in georgia my guess is that in the senate the attitude is going to be much less friendly toward cooperation with the russians
4580593 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
4580594 this tension with the newly energized and resurgent russia being run by a man that fancies himself as the czar of russia vladimir putin is now going to cause a very serious problem in our american space program
4580595 we feel that while its possible that government to government issues could have an impact on our relationship we havent really picked up any word or any feedback from the hill that thats what will happen
4580596 the administrations lack of contingency planning and its penny wise pound foolish budgeting for nasa have put the nation in the position where we dont really have a good alternative to depending on russia for the next seven years unless the nation is prepared to start providing significant additional funding to nasa

4580615 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4580616 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4580617 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4580618 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4580619 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
4580620 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4580621 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4580622 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

4580628 to some extent these olympics are staring to influence how people use new technology
4580629 about half of people who use mobile to watch nbc olympics content are using it for the first time
4580630 for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man but men spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit
4580631 beloved believe not every spirit but prove the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world we are of god he that knows god hears us he who is not of god hears us not by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
4580632 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4580633 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4580634 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4580635 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4580636 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation

4580644 what we want to do is make sure that all of our military members their family members and all of our u s citizens residing outside the united states have an opportunity to vote
4580645 absentee voting can be done by mail there are also some alternatives that weve been working with the states for electronic alternatives for our voters
4580646 so many states have passed legislation that allows a voter to submit voting materials by fax or e mail
4580647 we want to give the citizens as many opportunities as many alternatives as possible that are allowed by their state law to communicate with that local election office
4580648 we want everyone to participate in the voting process our servicemembers their family members and all of our overseas citizens
4580649 it is voting outreach to let them know that they are eligible to participate in this democratic process
4580650 so it is up to the voter to decide what they want to do
4580651 we want to make sure they have the information and the means to do so if they choose to vote
4580652 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others

4580658 construction and financial services continue to struggle in california but i am encouraged about recent increases in housing purchases and that other job sectors while they do not have the robust growth we want or expect in california are holding steady
4580659 with our state unemployment rate rising to its highest level in over a decade its clear that the legislature must act now to jump start our economy by embracing pro growth and pro jobs policies
4580660 one thing is clear our unemployment rate will grow far worse and more californians will lose their job with a budget that increases taxes now more than ever we must reject higher taxes and costly mandates

4580668 the main reason that serious content providers or laborers such as plaintiff provide content to youtube com at all
4580669 is to make a profit off of their creative work
4580670 this isnt to say that the chief goal or original draw to the entertainment business or the content creating business is to make money however it is an absolute necessary sic to sustain the work of content creating especially when content creating is your full time job notoriety in itself is of little consequence and is more of a myth of success than an actual reality

4580680 this story and others triggered more discussions about how we all got here how our ancestors got here and how others in our communities got here essentially how toronto was and is being shaped by movement
4580681 members of our collective each have a unique movement story to tell whether it is the experience of being a refugee a second generation canadian an indigenous canadian who has moved to toronto from ancestral homelands or a person who has lived both in toronto and back home our motivations for being in toronto are all different and reflect both the values that we learned from our families and our own aspirations as artists and individuals
4580682 the issue that we are concerned with is the issue of forgetting where we come from often we choose to or are forced to forget important aspects of our getting here stories forgetting happens for a lot of different reasons but always the outcome is a loss of sense of self a loss of ability to self identify with a culture we expect to reflect experiences of toronto back to our audiences and to affirm and highlight the many meaning of movement and the centrality of movement to the lives of people living in toronto that includes everyone not just immigrants

4580700 if you died with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world do you subject yourselves to ordinances 21 handle not nor taste nor touch 22 all which things are to perish with the using after the precepts and doctrines of men 23 which things have indeed a show of wisdom in self made religion and humility and asceticism to the body but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh
4580701 are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh
4580702 for the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit

4580758 for when gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law 15 they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
4580759 though they know gods decree that those who practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them

4580808 as the economy turns another corner here that could spell trouble for the region but i think what this shows is that poverty is not an intractable problem at least in the context of a decent economy low income families can live in somewhat better neighborhoods
4580809 i think the biggest reason that most people dont vote is they want someone else to do all the work for them they are too lazy to get involved in policy issues and the complaint that they dont have time is a bunch of bunk

4580827 while going through our records recently we found that your adsense account has posed a significant risk to our adwords advertisers
4580828 since keeping your account in our publisher network may financially damage our advertisers in the future weve decided to disable your account
4580829 ive been doing my best to filter these out through googles adsense interface
4580830 but there were so many of them from so many different domains it was really hard to keep up with blocking them it felt like i was going in every other day and blocking more and more sites
4580831 google said that it wasnt a complaint from scientology or any other organization that got enturbulation orgs adsense account shut down
4580832 some members of the forum wrongly believed that by clicking the ads repeatedly that scientology would be forced to fund the enturbulation website when all it did was alert the automated system of possible fraud
4580833 google isnt doing a good job of looking out for its adsense customers they arent saying we shouldnt be showing these sorts of ads on these sorts of sites
4580834 and then from where im sitting scientology is taking advantage of this telling google that by serving ads onto our site its causing financial damage
4580835 so google goes and shuts us down in my opinion theyre putting a band aid on a much bigger problem
4580836 they anointed us as the dream team but were not so dominant
4580837 were human were susceptible to making mistakes on the biggest stage and it showed

4580954 his caring loving god fearing personality came out and i realized he was a lot more mature than i thought
4580955 he told me we were going to a big 40th birthday party for one of his friends
4580956 chris actually made up an invitation and mailed it to his house knowing how nosy i am that id open it
4580957 i was so excited that we were the early birds and got to ride in it by ourselves
4580958 there was just one guy with a boat i realized that this must be it
4580959 i was looking through magazines and kept picking big poofy dresses
4580960 but chris liked the form fitting ones he kept hinting that he wanted me to show my shape
4580961 there was no drinking at the reception so many guests met at bar 23 for some drinking and dancing
4580962 they happened to be having a white party so we fit right in
4580963 what you are looking at are memories in this case pertaining to one individual holds up vial for harry to see this is perhaps the most important memory i have collected id like you to see it
4580964 in all the years toms been here hes never once had a visitor
4580965 i can make things move without touching them i can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me
4580966 i can speak to snakes too they find me whisper things
4580967 if things are so bad now and things arent working why not try someone new and different
4580968 a lot of guys say yeah i wish those guys well but once a guy gets hurt theyre thinking i have a chance to step up here ive been there done that i really do want jerry and reggie to get back here because that makes us better as a team
4580969 im definitely concerned because these are the guys that we need on the field to make plays for us

4580972 there have been some things here in this tennis tournament that have really not made me or other players comfortable every night im going to the bed at 3 30 four in the morning the next day i have to play about five six seven so this is a bit strange for me i never experienced that
4580973 it makes it obviously very intriguing for fans to watch that type of match
4580974 were not used to practicing at two in the morning but it happens you know we the players have to be ready for those things
4580975 its brutal because were playing this tournament in one week
4580976 i havent met him i just know that were family i havent really spoken to him but everywhere i go they call me chad they say that even before they know were related

4580978 i have an offer from west virginia an offer from ole miss fiu and ucf
4580979 its very exciting but i also have to stay humble
4580980 stedman he shows me the way if im doing anything wrong he builds my confidence up i start at slot but i play outside also i like playing the slot more than the outside because i get open a lot it helps me get open and it also helps my teammates get open
4580981 our offense is good but we balance it out we have a really good defense
4580982 he has the ability to play on either side of the ball on the next level
4580983 cameron has a natural lean for a running back hes a natural
4580984 he has outstanding vision and has the ability to run between the tackles
4580985 one of the things we really love about cameron is he is extremely coachable and hes a team leader
4580986 we are definitely going to be counting on him to be a team leader this fall due to the fact that we have lost a lot of senior leadership

4580991 i would like to be a part of oregons team but the reality is im very open
4580992 there was a lot of good talent out there i learned how to be more agile as a running back
4580993 it was also good competing with some of the best talent in the county players flew in from all over the country to participate in that camp
4580994 ive known about it for a couple of days but im not one to talk about offers until i have them i came home from football practice around 2 15 looked through the mail and it was there
4580995 i want to major in business so i did some research according to

4581000 there have been some things here in this tennis tournament that have really not made me or other players comfortable every night im going to the bed at 3 30 four in the morning the next day i have to play about five six seven so this is a bit strange for me i never experienced that
4581001 it makes it obviously very intriguing for fans to watch that type of match

4581006 with the announcement today hopefully even more people are going to come out and want to be a part of the program because of ryan that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from hopefully
4581007 with the tie to hendrick thats obviously assumed to be a good thing thats part of the reason i feel its going to be successful and i look forward to driving what currently even now is a hendrick car at stewart haas racing
4581008 last week i am wondering what kind of relationship he is looking for on that site is he single now just curious
4581009 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions
4581010 from day one the questions were all about how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4581011 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful

4581020 hmmmmmmmmmm maybe there was a prize for the person who found the stone

4581035 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4581036 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4581037 hm is there some way we can turn this into profit
4581038 listen what youre doing here is illegal no questions about it however were willing to make a deal that will benefit all of us in the end
4581039 no brasil para governar o presidente precisa ter uma base parlamentar ampla e nenhum partido tem a maioria de 50 por cento mais um capaz de dar sustentabilidade ao governo

4581046 coincidimos en la visi n que tenemos sobre el estado actual de la provincia donde vemos que la precariedad institucional a n no ha sido superada en el tiempo
4581047 nos hemos constituido en un espacio donde podemos discutir las distintas situaciones que va atravesando nuestra provincia en las cuestiones pol ticas sociales econ micas e institucional adem s en su momento nos comprometimos con el fud para cuidar y respetar lo institucional de la provincia y eso nos obliga a seguir reunidos
4581048 de alguna manera vivimos un proceso pol tico que demuestra una dependencia absoluta tanto de los estados nacionales como de la interrelaci n con las fuerzas que tiene que tener la democracia establecida en su constituci n para hacer una gesti n controlada y regualda por la misma constituci n y esto es un hecho que compartimos los tres para salir de esto y alertar a la gente

4581052 yo hab a hecho un proyecto de dictamen en minor a pero no avanc para no poner ning n tipo traba al proyecto que tiene media sanci n proyecto que creo que no va ser funcional y que va a ser de imposible implementaci n
4581053 legisladores de san luis y corrientes me plantearon la necesidad de que presente mi proyecto porque ellos no van a votar el que tiene media sanci n
4581054 es una costumbre que tiene el senado que cuando existen provincias que tienen intereses comunes como misiones y corrientes con la yerba pero no tienen acuerdo ese proyecto no se baja al recinto y nunca se trata
4581055 por esto quiero que quede claro para que no se generen falsas expectativas creo que va ser muy dif cil que progrese el proyecto
4581056 una vez que tuvimos la oportunidad de discutir en el congreso un proyecto de estas caracter sticas no le demos el tiempo y el debate necesario
4581057 los misioneros somos responsables por una falta de coordinaci n de los distintos sectores de ir a plantear una propuesta en conjunto en la que todos coincidamos un proyecto que beneficie a todo el sector

4581069 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4581070 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4581071 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4581072 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4581080 there are more independents than you had four years ago because you dont have an incumbent
4581081 democrats win the state when they hold down gop margins in rural districts and appeal to swing women voters in larimer county and the denver suburbs mr obama lacks rural credentials but he might make inroads in the suburbs mccain needs to run up votes in the gop strongholds of el paso colorado springs douglas south of denver weld eastern plains and mesa western slope counties while appealing to democratic and independent hispanics and catholics

4581091 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4581092 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4581093 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4581094 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4581095 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4581096 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold

4581117 against a lesser lineup maybe i get away with some of that stuff
4581118 i definitely would have been upset if i had been thrown out of the game

4581139 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery

4581155 whats the big deal if one of mccains advisers is a lobbyist for a country that is currently under attack
4581156 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4581157 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4581158 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to

4581160 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that

4581162 the main reason that serious content providers or laborers such as plaintiff provide content to youtube com at all
4581163 is to make a profit off of their creative work
4581164 this isnt to say that the chief goal or original draw to the entertainment business or the content creating business is to make money however it is an absolute necessary sic to sustain the work of content creating especially when content creating is your full time job notoriety in itself is of little consequence and is more of a myth of success than an actual reality
4581165 we will always have to bargain with them because they will always be a major geopolitical power
4581166 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon
4581167 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers

4581170 msft engineer thinks that linux inventor is right about something
4581171 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4581172 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
4581173 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
4581174 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
4581175 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
4581176 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
4581177 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
4581178 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
4581179 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
4581180 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
4581181 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now
4581182 life is boring simple story get drunk throw up sleep all day i am something im not nothing i cant let myself decay
4581183 heres a song yall all know if you dont fucking know this song youre not a korn fan
4581184 if theres one day that comes where they want to have to same purposes i do to help people then yeah maybe
4581185 i was no good as a trader id see those little kiddies without any milk or sugar and id be inclined to give the indians the best of the deal i had that weakness and most people have you know but there are traders who can buy fur and it wont bother them a bit if the indians go hungry it bothered me all the time theyd see all the stuff in my store and say why dont you give us something youve got lots and we havent got anything id carry a sack of sugar fifty miles on my back and theyd think i ought to share it with them well youve got lots theyd say but if the shoe had been on the other foot they would have given me half of whatever they had even if theyd carried it a thousand miles so you see where it is in their eyes i was stingy
4581186 damnit i just cant concentrate on the forces of change that are sweeping the country i need to know where else edwards dick has been

4581206 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4581207 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

4581301 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4581302 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4581303 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4581304 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4581305 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

4581317 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect

4581331 ibanez they might net something for but i think not twins are rebuilding for the future not throwing away their future for a shot at this year
4581332 friday 12 19pm joe christensen has details on the twins uncharacteristic claim of washburn he heard they offered the mariners boof bonser plus apparently the salary relief but the ms wanted someone like nick blackburn or kevin slowey it is hard to see this as anything but a blunder for the mariners front office

4581342 it really is an exciting time for city of portsmouth the region and all of us in new hampshire as we welcome these two tall ships
4581343 the tall ships represent an important part of our history our culture and in fact our ongoing economy
4581344 i wanted to see the pirate ships because theyre cool

4581399 it seems to me that the united states has to have a darned good reason to break off relations with russia and go back to the dark days of the cold war
4581400 i dont believe events thus far provide that reason both sides need the other too much
4581401 we have never profited much by not talking to people with whom we dont have common ground
4581402 i have never believed we are very effective at trying to play the game of reward and punishment with a nation as big as russia
4581403 the missile defense deal with poland certainly raises the ante and i believe that the timing is anything but accidental
4581404 we should not take our eye off the immediate issue which is for the first time since the end of the soviet union russian troops have invaded and are occupying another country
4581405 but isolating russia is not really an option it will not be isolated it is too big it is too powerful
4581406 if for some reason or another the russians proceed with their occupation go to tbilisi and topple saakashvili then we are probably in a world where russia finds itself outside the community of nations and some type of militarized rivalry is likely to return

4581420 they use them for lunch to and from meetings we actually see our bikes on the front of buses so we know people are taking them home and using them for commuting

4581422 trek specialized schwinn fuji raleigh and giant are offering the bikes and theres about a half million dollars worth of product being donated to this project

4581424 but with the security restrictions there is esentially a no car no bike zone around the xcel energy center so we put the bikes down here on shepard road people can still come down and get the bikes and use them to get as close as they can to see whats going on

4581455 distrugger la sapienza dei sapienti e abbasser lintelligenza di coloro che si credono intelligenti
4581456 infatti che cosa hanno da dire i sapienti gli studiosi gli esperti di dibattiti culturali dio ha ridotto a pazzia la sapienza di questo mondo gli uomini con tutta la loro scienza non sono stati capaci di conoscere dio e la sua sapienza perci dio ha deciso di salvare quelli che credono mediante questo annuncio di salvezza che sembra pazzia
4581457 alcuni infatti vorrebbero grandi segni e portenti e altri si fidano solo della ragione noi invece annunciamo cristo inchiodato sul legno e per gli ebrei questo messaggio offensivo mentre per tutti gli altri pazzia ma per quelli che dio ha chiamati siano essi ebrei o no cristo potenza e sapienza di dio perch la pazzia di dio pi sapiente della sapienza degli uomini
4581458 nessuno inganni s stesso se qualcuno pensa di essere sapiente nelle cose di questo mondo diventi pazzo per il mondo e allora sar sapiente davvero dio infatti considera pazzia tutto quello che il mondo crede sia sapienza si legge infatti nella bibbia dio fa cadere i sapienti nella trappola della loro stessa astuzia e ancora in unaltro passo leggiamo il signore conosce i pensieri dei sapienti e sa che non valgono nulla perci non vantatevi di appartenere a capi umani e terreni perch gi tutto vi appartiene e voi invece appartenete a cristo e cristo appartiene a dio

4581677 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4581678 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4581679 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4581680 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4581681 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4581682 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4581683 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4581684 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4581685 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4581686 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
4581687 our economy is booming our cost of living is getting higher people in the past who may have been looking at volunteering are now working

4581689 when women are no longer victims of violence when they stop being harassed by men just because they are women and they dress how they dress when men stop slapping butts when they stop doing the classic rubbing up y they stop bothering and insulting them only then when we men have the civility to respect women totally can we remove this program if we do it before then we are putting them at risk
4581690 only about 30 to 50 years worth of oil left at present rates of consumption
4581691 whether were talking about crude oil natural gas or coal the trend is the same every year were paying more and expending more effort for less and less energy
4581692 what they did there was great shakespeare is all based on beat rhythm and rhyme and all those things that rappers deal with
4581693 the challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
4581694 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
4581695 the waiver is required because under u s law any country that provides weapons or nuclear capabilities to countries like iran north korea and syria is prohibited from getting american technology or entering into any contract for american technology
4581696 it would be illegal for nasa unless they had a waiver to actually contract to use the soyuz to get to and from the space station
4581697 but that was before the hostilities in georgia my guess is that in the senate the attitude is going to be much less friendly toward cooperation with the russians
4581698 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
4581699 this tension with the newly energized and resurgent russia being run by a man that fancies himself as the czar of russia vladimir putin is now going to cause a very serious problem in our american space program
4581700 we feel that while its possible that government to government issues could have an impact on our relationship we havent really picked up any word or any feedback from the hill that thats what will happen
4581701 the administrations lack of contingency planning and its penny wise pound foolish budgeting for nasa have put the nation in the position where we dont really have a good alternative to depending on russia for the next seven years unless the nation is prepared to start providing significant additional funding to nasa
4581702 the routine administration of glycoprotein gp iib iiia blockers in patients with stemi is a class 2a indication according to us and european guidelines
4581703 large registry studies show that in real world practice gp iib iiia blockers are given to only 25 to 30 of patients with stemi often for bailout situations
4581704 should not be restricted to patients with complications after pci even in a setting in which high dose clopidogrel is given well in advance of pci
4581705 patients were diagnosed and immediately treated in the ambulance by either a physician or a dedicated well trained paramedic diagnosis was correct in 94 of patients with computerized ecg algorithms only without the need for transmission of the ecg to the hospital
4581706 on time 2 tells us more than the benefit of high dose tirofiban in primary pci the study reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the need for fast and strong platelet inhibition
4581707 reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organized prehospital systems have been able to provide such a service
4581708 has received research grants from bristol myers squibb sanofi aventis eli lilly and centocor
4581709 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
4581710 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
4581711 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have reevaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders
4581712 this building will bring together the wild maine blueberry community and the union fair to celebrate the blueberry industry
4581713 everybody here has raked at one time and it celebrates all the work that comes into making blueberries happen
4581714 one of the values of education is that it exposes the general public to the challenges and types of things farmers have to do to produce food every day
4581715 the important thing is that people eat five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day and wed like a few of those servings to be wild blueberries
4581716 now the challenge is to figure out how to effectively use that space
4581717 they have a lot of great ideas and a strong cadre of volunteers and i am sure they are going to keep moving forward over the next few years
4581718 this is the only agricultural fair that hosts a specific building that goes with the fair
4581719 in this building we will have six new vendors who produce exclusively with a focus on blueberries
4581720 we continually invite and encourage younger people to get involved and take advantage of the knowledge base

4581779 this is the best ive felt all season i think its all due to my legs my strength is back ive been taking care of my knee doing my exercises and getting the treatment that i need its taken a long time but im glad its to the point where i feel very strong with my back leg
4581780 weve made lots of claims weve gotten some we havent gotten some if we could make a deal to make our club better were going to do that but we also have to be protective of the future scouting and development is our lifeblood
4581781 theres no question that maybe our bullpen could use a shot in the arm

4581795 hardloper ben ik en psychiater of psychotherapeut mental coach en pillendokter maar in alles eerst en vooral hardloper volgens mij kun je het niet worden hardloper
4581796 like most first time marathoners i sailed through 18 miles of my first marathon feeling like a million bucks by 21 miles i wasnt worth five cents i faded badly over those final six miles my second marathon was even worse
4581797 zijn hardlooppogingen heeft hij allang opgegeven zijn marathondromen leiden een vegeterend bestaan ik zwaai naar hem en keer mijn hoofd om zodat ik langzaam de concentratie kan opbouwen die nu nog week is en makkelijk kan loslaten maar hard en ondoordringbaar moet worden zodat ze me aan het einde van de marathon kan beschermen tegen de pijn die ik zal voelen
4581798 niemand begrijpt waarom ik hardloop en eerlijk gezegd zelf begrijp ik het ook nauwelijks of in ieder geval maar bij vlagen zon plotseling inzicht verschilt bovendien altijd weer van het vorige splijtende inzicht over de fundamentele redenen waarom ik ren maar ik hoef het ook niet te begrijpen en dat ik het niet hoef te begrijpen houdt me gaande
4581799 het gaat me in mijn hoofd makkelijk af maar onderweg voel ik dat mijn lichaam ook niet echt begrijpt waarom ik zoveel vrije tijd in dat stomme voortsjokken steek

4581818 come i will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication
4581819 here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits
4581820 the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast 13 these are of one mind and they will give their power and authority to the beast 14 these will make war with the lamb and the lamb will overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and those who are with him are called chosen and faithful
4581821 the waters which you saw where the harlot sits are peoples multitudes nations and tongues 16 and the ten horns which you saw on d the beast these will hate the harlot make her desolate and naked eat her flesh and burn her with fire 17 for god has put it into their hearts to fulfill his purpose to be of one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of god are fulfilled 18 and the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth
4581822 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4581823 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4581824 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4581825 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4581826 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4581828 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4581829 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4581830 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4581831 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4581832 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4581833 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4581834 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4581835 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4581836 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4581837 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4581838 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4581839 the fact that theres a close linkage between obama and patrick to a point where they were even using the same campaign stump speech
4581840 were going to be competitive with john kerry on tv and the radio with clear and succinct messages to draw distinctions on key issues
4581841 john kerry is someone that has not been as activist as he should have been for the people of massachusetts
4581842 hes been at this for 24 years he really hasnt had the type of legacy you would want
4581843 who are voters going to trust to fight to protect families fight to protect jobs and fight to protect our country

4581852 we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of god

4581856 i tell you the truth this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others they all gave out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in everything all she had to live on
4581857 john mccain supports supplementing the current social security system with personal accounts but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept
4581858 thats the way ronald reagan and tip oneill did it
4581859 if were going to go this route where we no longer have a link between what you pay in and what you get back then what is this program
4581860 its enjoyed a lot of political support precisely because there was this link

4581866 we realised we had to get out of georgia as a whole not just the region
4581867 my cousin is trapped at the moment trying to get back by train
4581868 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4581869 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4581870 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4581871 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4581872 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4581873 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4581874 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4581875 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4581876 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4581877 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4581878 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4581879 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4581880 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4581881 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

4581889 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4581890 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4581891 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4581892 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4581896 controlling the spread of infectious diseases such as hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis using mathematical equations and formulas
4581897 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4581898 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4581899 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4581900 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4581901 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4581902 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4581903 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4581904 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4581905 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase

4581909 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4581910 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4581911 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4581912 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4581913 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4581914 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4581915 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4581916 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4581917 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4581918 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4581919 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4581920 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4581921 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4581922 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4581923 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4581924 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4581925 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4581926 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4581927 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4581928 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4581929 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4581930 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4581931 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4581932 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4581933 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4581934 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4581935 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4581936 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4581937 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4581938 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4581939 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4581940 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4581941 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4581942 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4581943 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4581944 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4581945 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4581946 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4581947 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4581948 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4581949 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4581950 who are open to doing something on the production side
4581951 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4581952 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4581953 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4581954 het zou nog wel eens maanden kunnen duren voordat het beest wordt gevangen
4581955 this is a verizon wireless center you need the verizon store
4581956 let me sell you all kinds of upgrades and fancy gizmos to your new phone while i take 20 minutes to activate your account

4581962 it will be interesting to see the creations and select a winner to spend a day with me on the project site i always enjoy sharing my thoughts and suggestions with others on golf course design
4581963 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
4581964 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
4581965 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
4581966 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
4581967 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
4581968 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
4581969 weve got temporary signs and banners for monday with the new identification
4581970 we really want this bank to last for generations where people feel secure that we wont merge with someone bigger and have their lives screwed up
4581971 back then you had credit chasing deals and loans were made above the present value of the real estate
4581972 today banks are requiring more equity from participants our company typically would require 20 to 30 percent equity from a developer
4581973 o m g mom you have got to be kidding me
4581974 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4581975 no but its just a couple of minutes down the road
4581976 no no youre half way there already are you from the campground
4581977 yes were trying to see if our motorhome will fit on the ferry ive heard the ramp might be too short and we might bottom out
4581978 oh well it surely would have fit on the old ferry but im not sure about the new one
4581979 last week but you know you probably could fit on at high tide
4581980 high tide can you tell me when the tide will be in
4581981 oh every six hours its listed in the local paper each day
4581982 wtn services platinum sponsor 10 discount off the registration fee of the wine technology symposium july 15th 2008
4581983 the congregants yell in joy as ushers pass the white buckets down the row to collect the envelopes

4581997 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4581998 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4581999 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4582000 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country
4582001 shss system containing photo voltaic panel battery charge controller solar lamp and switch is a convenient mode of supplying power for small electrical loads such as lights radio cassette players and black and white tv

4582014 but instead of locking arms with the ama the kidney foundation is poised to sabotage the associations efforts in keeping with its recent practice of blocking any attempt to explore the possibility of compensating organ donors why the stubborn opposition
4582015 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4582016 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in europe and pacific industrialized nations oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world oil demand growth the lowest since 2002
4582017 if you cant tell a good story then youll probably lose your invitations to sunday suppers and good fried chicken
4582018 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook

4582020 as la conquista musulmana fue el gran desastre de la historia de espa a impuso un gran retraso en la cultura que tuvo que ser salvada con las influencias carolingia borgo ona y cisterciense y un gran retraso en la unificaci n ling stica de espa a ello pese a algunos influjos culturales y ling sticos casi todos de origen griego o iranio de la cultura musulmana fue la de espa a una unificaci n siempre parcial y que todav a hoy sigue causando problemas
4582021 hispania se fragment en efecto tanto pol tica como ling sticamente por el hecho de que la reconquista se realiz valle a valle regi n a regi n de norte al sur vino luego la pugna entre las lenguas as surgidas y la primac a pero no dominio absoluto del castellano menos mal que las unificaciones pol ticas que promocionaron el castellano no fueron por medio de guerras como a veces maliciosamente se dice fueron por matrimonios herencias y pactos dentro de un sentido general de comunidad de pertenecer todos a hispania
4582022 sigui la unificaci n propiamente dicha con la boda de isabel y fernando y el acceso del ltimo al trono de arag n pero ya en el siglo xiv el castellano dominaba en catalu a como lengua culta de comunicaci n el catal n se convert a en lengua local para los burgueses y el pueblo
4582023 este fue el auge del castellano a partir del peque o condado de castilla que fern n gonz lez independiz de le n en el siglo x aunque no formalmente hasta 1037 sali indemne de las correr as de almanzor en torno al 1000 lo que no fue peque a suerte estaba situado en una regi n monta osa y pobre mal comunicada fronteriza de cantabria la tarraconense la cartaginense y vasconia el sur de cantabria lava la bureba hasta los montes de oca y clunia eran su n cleo con monasterios como los de san mill n o a y silos luego el centro se traslad a burgos con fernando vi ya en plena expansi n a toledo conquistada en 1080 se recuperaba as la tradici n visigoda castilla tras le n era ya la potencia dominante pol tica y culturalmente de espa a
4582024 el caso es que tras las glosas silenses y emilianenses a finales del x a n m s desde el xii con el mio cid y sobre todo el xiii con berceo y alfonso el sabio el castellano se transform en lengua literaria sobre todo de la prosa aunque persist a eel lat n como lengua documental y se hizo lengua tambi n de la l rica que en un comienzo era en gallego
4582025 pronto fue la lengua m s robusta de espa a que se hablaba como lengua com n en toda la meseta norte galicia navarra arag n y la meseta sur
4582026 en cuanto a la literatura la gallega qued restringida a la l rica en el siglo xv luego se extingui como la aragonesa del resto s lo hubo gran literatura en catalu a y valencia pero desert de all desde el siglo xv el castellano convertido ya en espa ol devino lengua cortesana administrativa literaria la de las clases elevadas y a n las medias
4582027 tambi n perduraron en vasconia los dialectos vascos luego todos estos dialectos no hab a un vasco un gallego un catal n unitarios desaparecieron en unos lugares en otros quedaron en un estado dir amos de hibernaci n hasta que fueron resucitados y unificados ya en los siglos xix y xx por los movimientos nacionalistas
4582028 pero el castellano hizo otros progresos se convirti en la lengua de las grandes ciudades vascas el vasco qued reducido a la vida rural y no fue unificado hasta la creaci n del batua sobre la base del guipuzcoano y el labortano ya en el siglo xx tras la guerra civil ten a una literatura bien eclesi stica bien oral pero muy pocas veces escrita
4582029 el castellano avanz hacia el sur y ocup la zona anteriormente rabe incluido en el xv el reino de granada suplant tambi n aqu al moz rabe en ese mismo siglo salt a canarias am rica y otros lugares del mundo
4582030 asimismo recibi influjos cultos a los que en alguna medida ya he hecho referencia del italiano del lat n y el griego human sticos y cient ficos del franc s del ingl s se convirti as en una de las lenguas fundamentales del planeta tras una accidentada historia la invasi n isl mica fue superada de alg n modo nunca del todo sin ella la continuaci n del lat n en el espa ol no habr a tenido presumiblemente los problemas que ha tenido y tiene no sabemos d nde habr a estado el n cleo de la evoluci n ling stica ni c mo habr an sucedido las cosas
4582031 el castellano era se ha dicho muchas veces a partir de don ram n men ndez pidal una lengua muy innovadora frente a la cual tanto el moz rabe como el asturleon s y el navarroaragon s incluso a veces el gallegoportugu s y el catal n ten an en su fon tica y morfolog a rasgos comunes
4582032 luego desde el siglo xv el castellano monopoliz los influjos cultos de los que he hablado sobre todo en fon tica graf a l xico y sintaxis monopoliz pr cticamente la literatura la administraci n y la cultura de toda espa a todav a en el siglo xiv hab a literatura aragonesa juan fern ndez de heredia traducciones diversas aparte de la gallega y la catalana luego desde el xv ya no

4582039 the wii is a great opportunity for hitting hardcore gamers
4582040 no one is doing that with madworld from platinum games we are trying to show that millions of wii gamers want to move on to mature games they dont have to have an xbox 360 to do that
4582041 the wii is a very cost effective platform to experiment with
4582042 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii in general
4582043 if its not a good game it doesnt sell that flood of crap will die down as publishers become more coherent
4582044 they marketed things to investors making specific representations about liquidity but failing to disclose to them that there were potential risks in the marketplace that might affect their ability to actually provide the liquidity they claimed was available
4582045 this is the only reality there is if you can get it down on paper in words notes or color so much the better
4582046 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
4582047 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
4582048 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
4582049 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4582050 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4582051 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4582052 for the candidates there are pluses that mr bush brings and difficulties
4582053 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4582054 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4582055 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4582059 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4582060 we will always have to bargain with them because they will always be a major geopolitical power
4582061 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4582062 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4582063 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4582064 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4582065 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4582066 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4582067 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4582068 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4582069 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4582070 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4582076 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4582077 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4582078 once we have covered a certain area it will be marked finished nobody has to go there it is done

4582100 i had a lot of information i saw the rangers game we needed quality and this is a good guy
4582101 before the questions comes about mr romanov i will tell you something i was the person who decided that if the time was there when kaunas did not have any chance in the champions league or uefa cup that i needed this guy here
4582102 he is a very talented goalkeeper we need goalkeepers here
4582103 i saw this goalkeeper in the training camp in germany when he played two games he convinced me
4582104 i think that the best possibility is to know that we look for quality the owner also wants quality we dont do too many transfers
4582105 the hungarian goalkeeper is very talented but it is a decision between me the goalkeeper and the club
4582106 at the moment he told me he would fly back we made an offer
4582107 he told me he wants to think about this you cannot force someone to come here
4582108 it is a great honor to get recognized by the coaching staff with the black jersey

4582114 open source co creation is a powerful way to build a strong development community
4582115 adobes decision to open source the flex sdk is a radical move which should attract a new class of developer to the platform
4582116 the definition and evolution of flex has been influenced by our incredibly talented developer community from day one
4582117 the decision to open source flex was a completely natural next step i am incredibly excited to deeply collaborate with the developer community on flex and further fuel its momentum and innovation

4582202 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4582203 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4582204 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4582205 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4582206 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4582207 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

4582209 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
4582210 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4582211 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4582212 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4582213 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4582214 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4582215 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4582216 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4582217 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4582218 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4582219 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4582220 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4582221 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4582222 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
4582223 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

4582241 the need to harness community generated content is the new reality which all of us in the media need to accept and mindtouch nexus provides us with a powerful service to fulfill that need in a controlled way
4582242 community generated content and social media must be a required component of a compelling web presence because users demand and expect to interact and collaborate with a site and its other users to enrich their experience
4582243 to ignore that demand is not a viable response as the people will just go elsewhere and they can go in a hurry the question is how to tap that powerful force in a controlled way that satisfies the site owners various objectives mindtouch nexus enables site owners to harness the peoples voice so that it blends in with the rest of the site as an integral part of our customers web presence

4582265 a lot of the grassland areas have lots of acreage thats got to be burned by a certain deadline you cant just do it any old day
4582266 when you have to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time the power torch is definitely the way to go
4582267 otherwise you have to walk around with a little hand torch
4582268 usually were not worried about where the current fire is
4582269 the question we have to ask is where is the next fire going to be its a constant game of catch up
4582270 before say 1980 we used pretty rough and ready methods
4582271 now on a computer you can actually show what the perimeter of land burned would look like after 1 hour or 2 hours it helps in all kinds of scenarios
4582272 would expand our capability a great deal because right now we have a limited infrastructure built for infrared technology
4582273 we can access the satellite information over the updated twice daily
4582274 we are good to go for launch on september 4 we look forward to soon providing the national geospatial intelligence agency and our other customers around the globe with the highest resolution and best quality commercial satellite imagery available on the market

4582276 the voices that espouse energy independence are doing the nation a disservice by focusing on a goal that is unachievable over the foreseeable future and that encourages the adoption of inefficient and counterproductive policies
4582277 after july 1 2010 all store customers must provide their own bags or purchase bags made of paper or other biogradable material from the store for 25 cents

4582279 we see the project as the future of the sarajevo festival to be a platform for discovering and encouraging young film professionals from the whole region and give them a chance to make their first short films
4582280 i think this is the festivals most significant strategic accomplishment this year to enter the production process
4582281 the competition will be strong due to booming film production in the region
4582282 weve seen the success of bosnian and romanian films on the world stage in recent years and now its happening with turkish cinematography

4582284 back door talks are still going on things have not yet been finalised lets see what happens
4582285 well wishers are trying to ensure that matters are settled amicably through discussions rather than going through a long protracted impeachment process
4582286 the president has already decided to defend himself in parliament hes not going to resign
4582287 russia is treading in the wrong direction away from the integration with the west
4582288 although a risk of such a scenario exists it is yet far from becoming a reality
4582289 now the risk is that people disagree over what decisions are made but its a very different type of debate when you are questioning the policy rather than the ability to make policy
4582290 the worst form of government is always anarchy and there was virtual anarchy in place in 1998
4582291 weve seen those political risks they are priced in now markets are certainly being spooked by the headlines but relative to the number of headlines that are being generated the economic fallout is insignificant
4582292 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett

4582298 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4582300 we are thrilled that the judge did not require us to continue to engage in the folly of purchasing a 4 2 million condo at a time when we should be considering other matters
4582301 we believe the court injected a dose of reality into a contested litigation and feel that we have started down the road to resolution

4582310 its something that you got to take care of something you might watch out for
4582311 thank god most people are honest and its not such a problem that it could put you out of business but if your not diligent it can
4582312 you have diligence in scheduling to make sure materials are delivered and used or installed that same day or pretty quickly so there not sitting around

4582315 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4582316 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4582317 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4582318 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4582319 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4582320 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4582321 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold

4582324 de samenwerkings mogelijkheden zijn legio zo kunnen leerlingen van de scholen eenvoudig gebruiken maken van de bibliotheek kunnen verenigingen zaalruimte huren en gebruik maken van de horeca en zitten huisartsen fysiotherapeuten en apothekers onder n dak hierdoor zijn de organisaties meer zichtbaar en eenvoudig te bereiken daarnaast kunnen activiteiten gecombineerd worden en is er sprake van effici nt ruimtegebruik
4582325 de verhuur van de zalen wordt gesubsidieerd door de gemeente hierdoor blijven de prijzen beperkt denk bij de podiumzaal bijvoorbeeld aan 20 euro voor een dagdeel

4582328 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4582329 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4582330 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4582331 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows

4582335 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4582371 i had been running a public film program at the american museum of natural history in new york city the margaret mead film festival and it occurred to me that a collaborative program in washington would be valuable if we broadened it brought in different kinds of films with discussions and programs
4582372 i had no problem getting people to sign on to this idea
4582373 were in contact with groups and individuals who want to do the same thing all over the world

4582377 peacemaking among christians is not simply one activity among others but rather is the very form of the church insofar as the church is the form of the one who is our peace peacemaking is the form of our relations in the church as we seek to be in unity with one another such unity is not that built on shallow optimism that we can get along if we respect one anothers differences rather it is a unity that profoundly acknowledges our differences because we have learned that those differences are not accidental to our being a truthful people even when they require us to confront one another as those who have wronged us
4582378 regarding those outside the church first i think we must say that it is the task of the church to confront and challenge the false peace of the world which is too often built more on power than truth to challenge the worlds sense of peace may well be dangerous because often when sham peace is exposed it threatens to become violent the church however cannot be less truthful with the world than it is expected to be with itself if we are less truthful we have not peace to offer to the world
4582379 second christians are prohibited from ever despairing of the peace possible in the world we know that as gods creatures we are not naturally violent nor are our institutions unavoidably violent as gods people we have been created for peace rather what we must do is to help the world find the habits of peace whose absence so often makes violence seem like the only alternative peacemaking as a virtue is an act of imagination built on long habits of the resolution of differences
4582380 the great problem in the world is that our imagination has been stilled since it has not made a practice of confronting wrongs so that violence might be avoided in truth we must say that the church has too often failed the world by its failure to witness in our own life the kind of conflict necessary to be a community of peace without an example of peacemaking community the world has no alternative but to use violence as a means to settle disputes
4582381 peacemaking is not a passive response to violence rather it is an active way to resist injustice by confronting the wrongdoer with the offer of reconciliation such reconciliation is not cheap however since no reconciliation is possible unless the wrong is confronted and acknowledged

4582399 its a rare honour and i appreciate the union government for accepting the state governments recommendation
4582400 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls
4582401 battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
4582402 there is no proof that carbon dioxide is causing or precedes global warming
4582403 all indications are that the minor warming cycle finished in 2001 and that arctic ice melting is related to cyclical orbit tilt axis changes in earths angle to the sun
4582404 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4582405 flabbergasted by the decision that awarded native american plaintiffs 455 million less than 1 percent of the 47 billion they were seeking
4582406 its amazing that the united states government could get away with this for so long we sued the united states government for fixing the systems that manage our money
4582407 normally if youve behaved like the united states government in the management of our trust funds you would not be walking the streets you would be in jail

4582469 he preys on at least he did the people who believed in him

4582512 the idea is to bring together a wide range of communities and groups that share the same concerns but in the normal course of events wouldnt have the opportunity to talk to each other

4582518 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4582519 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4582520 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country

4582550 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4582551 india should start preparation from now on for the 2012 olympics if it wants to achieve glory
4582552 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4582553 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4582554 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4582555 this shrine amarnath is a shining example of our secular traditions where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4582556 this requires a politics of consensus not confrontation this requires dialogue among communities not discord

4582559 safe or safety means that there is reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use

4582561 we get this opportunity once every 10 or so years
4582562 we are pleased to recommend freehold licensing to texas builders and developers
4582563 we appreciate the trust and confidence placed in us by such a respected professional organization and we look forward to bringing increased value and flexibility to gsaba members gsaba members play an important role in building a better community while making property more affordable we believe that transfer fee rights represent an important tool for developers and we take great pride in the long term funding solutions we help create for non profits
4582564 we have found freehold licensing to be a knowledgeable and professional organization that helps builders and developers restructure the economics of their projects in an important and valuable way in fact i truly believe that freeholds process of creating transfer fees represents an increasingly popular way of more fairly apportioning ever increasing development costs and in consequence helping to keep property affordable no longer can a builder or developer be content with business as usual in todays increasingly competitive environment it is important for builders and developers to look at every tool available that can help them stay competitive and deliver a better product at a more affordable price i believe freeholds system absolutely accomplishes this goal
4582565 our forecast is lower but i think its also more realistic
4582566 by studying how well farmers do financially we take adaptation into account the income from farming will depend not only on the direct effect of the weather on the crops and livestock but also on whatever the farmers do to cope with this
4582567 irrigation may make indian farms more robust now but water reservoirs may also dry up as the climate warms and many farms are not near them in any case
4582568 i think to assume that farms will adapt in developing countries is highly questionable particularly across brazil which has regions of great economic disparity in different parts of the country
4582569 at the start of the ride we were cycling on the flat californian desert in over 120 degrees of heat

4582574 right now the ncsl is out in the forefront of an effort to stall u s department of health and humans services medicaid rules because it will cost states 41 billion to implement
4582575 if the ncsl is out there advocating we want them to advocate they way we want which may not be how new york or pennsylvania wants it

4582578 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4582579 things have worked out broadly speaking the way we intended them to
4582580 as well as costs going up businesses were widening their margins so there was a pronounced increase in inflationary pressure the danger was that if that continued it would cause severe difficulties for the economy in the years ahead
4582581 weve asked households to cut back on spending and weve given them the inducement to do so with higher interest rates households have responded favourably households have been prudent in cutting back on spending and lifting savings that is why the reserve bank can talk about cutting interest rates

4582587 the data seems to have had a pretty profound impact on thecanadian dollar the currency is really rallying in starkcontrast to the trend weve seen over the last few weeks
4582588 i have to say im a little bit surprised that its managedto completely outweigh the softness in commodity prices but itsimply seems that some days commodity prices dont win
4582589 todays report is marginally encouraging to us but wethink it is not plausible that canadas manufacturing sectorcan grow sustainably with u s domestic demand contracting canadian domestic demand weakening and the cad canadiandollar still relatively strong
4582590 you have a moderate rally in the u s and canada istracking that but its underperforming on the strong canadianeconomic data

4582597 california impliedly allows parents to homeschool as a private school but has provided no enforcement mechanism given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for homeschooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
4582598 we want parents to have the freedom to homeschool but we dont want children to become captives in a homeschool that doesnt prepare them for work or civic engagement as a functioning adult

4582603 flyer beware american airlines fined 7 1 million dollars by faa for putting passengers and crews lives at risk again
4582604 when it comes to the airlines the odds are good that the goods are odd
4582605 this once again shows the airlines cannot be held accountable for even the most basic of security measures and further proves the need for congress and the department of transportation to step in and enforce existing laws which they have clearly been avoiding due to unearned sympathy for the airlines lobbying dollars poured into our congress to plead with them once again not to pass meaningful passengers rights standards and thats just unacceptable when it comes to the airlines and congress the odds are good that the goods are odd

4582609 at the michael j fox foundation we believe that our capital has an obligation to fund high risk high reward projects that if successful could significantly improve the lives of people with parkinsons
4582610 a major element of our work is the identification and prioritization of approaches like armagens efforts that without our backing would likely stall for lack of resources
4582611 trojan horse technology has intrigued parkinsons researchers for years because of its theoretical potential to overcome the drug delivery hurdle one of the single most significant challenges facing the entire field
4582612 it is fitting that the michael j fox foundation which is searching urgently for treatments that will significantly modify parkinsons disease should provide funding to vet the potential of this technology to yield new therapies that could transform patients lives

4582836 the planned acquisition of jinan fertilizer will strengthen our position in the coal based chemical sector and once due diligence now underway is completed we anticipate a relatively seamless transition of our existing chemical facility to the new location
4582837 we are excited about our robust growth this quarter and year to date demand for our npcc and chemical products remained strong we seek to expand our share in the npcc market in china and internationally by continuing to sell the proven npcc value proposition our customers are realizing that npcc is a cost effective way to improve measurably the quality of the products they produce using our proprietary formulas currently we are in the r amp d testing process with a number of new customers including 26 potential domestic customers and five potential international customers in addition we are working in close contact with 47 potential customers and will start the testing process soon
4582838 we believe jinan fertilizers operations will benefit from our proven management and industry experience and we will work diligently to integrate our existing chemical operations as smoothly as possible jinan fertilizers quancheng brand is a well known high quality name in shangdong province and will allow us to expand our current product offering increase our customer base and gain a strong foothold in the concentrated nitric acid markets both in china and internationally

4583067 small tape recorders at the time were as big as a common cassette tape there was no way to use one so i took notes in a notepad i kept in my trousers pocket but i couldnt take notes in front of anyone so i wrote when i was alone during the concert it was easy to write because it was dark and there was no one else in the backstage no one would notice the worst moment was in the dressing room there was i along with jo o gilberto and his manager they were sitting in a sofa and i was standing when he went to the stage to test the sound i took as many notes as i could still astonished for listening jo o gilberto play so near me

4583133 we extended paul mccarthys video costume piece pinocchio pipenose household dilemma party pack which was being exhibited at the hessell museum on bard colleges campus to the outside world
4583134 there is no sense in speculating about that because the medical people are telling me where he is hes feeling better and getting there but you know its just one of those things
4583135 it would be an embarrassment if they went out there on monday and theres not a kicker on the field chase blackburn is the backup and i dont know if you guys want to see that
4583136 it was wet it was saturday so the field was still really wet and just a bad deal
4583137 everyday im going through treatment and im working with our trainers who are very good at what they do
4583138 i just listen to what they say i still have to go kick here soon and see where im at i dont know what day we are planning on doing that
4583139 ive never missed five days in a row of kicking
4583140 ive been out since saturday and today is friday plus ive never missed a game its all been positive we have so many games coming up in the next couple of weeks im just trying to be cautious
4583141 strength wise its been great you just dont want to get out there and set yourself back obviously its trusting the doctors and vice president of medical services ronnie barnes who has been doing this for 30 years so they are very excited about my progress and im feeling good about it of course i would love to be out there but the last thing i want to do is go out there and then take five steps back
4583142 i always know what to expect of me and it always hurts to see your guys going out there and you miss the camaraderie but those guys know ive never been one to take any time off from that standpoint that is reassuring guys know me personally so most of my frustrations are gone to be honest with you my main thing is for everyone to see a healthy number 85 out there
4583143 its a four month surgery so im at four months
4583144 thats what i was told and you always want to beat the odds
4583145 i feel strong very strong i have no pain no soreness and maybe a little bit of swelling which is something that can be reoccurring but nothing that will keep me from working every day thats always good
4583146 obviously its a great situation to be on pup and have the time if you need it i dont want to but if that is something we have to do then you just have to do it my main thing is getting back there healthy and i want to be in a position to help the team not hurt it
4583147 last nights weather forecast was different than the one this morning
4583148 i had planned on going out i went out to the field it was raining it was steady and i didnt like the conditions of the field so we changed to what had been planned as a jog through but outside and hopefully well work this afternoon there is unless the thing has changed again there is some indication of sun possible sun with scattered showers throughout the afternoon so well see
4583149 weve adjusted a couple of practices but we have not missed anything
4583150 to be honest with you it requires that you spend way too much time considering the weather its a ridiculous amount of time you spend on that but with the way this month of august has been theres no other way of doing it you just have to try and stay out in front of it some weve been able to do a good job of predicting and others not so well we have not missed for example this morning was scheduled as a jog through but the weather forced us inside fine we didnt want to be but if it did we would still get our mental work in and thats basically what happened
4583151 anytime you cant go full speed it affects your preparation
4583152 weve gone through the mental parts and weve gone through the meetings we continue to have meetings and well have more hopefully well practice this afternoon
4583153 we just dont see anything he cant practice so you go on everything you understood about him when you drafted him hes in every meeting he does all that but he doesnt get to rep it for a young guy they need to do it
4583154 it started out as a groin it went to a hamstring and you know its been one thing after another that has not helped we went through this last year and we count on steve being out there so its been that position this year thats given us a lot of headaches

4583157 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4583159 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4583160 im not sure why he mentioned it to me but he asked me to i think find out if you had any business contacts in phoenix with respect to his son
4583161 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion
4583162 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race
4583163 the one thing is you want for the kids to go away and keep talking about what a great show it was and thats what theyre doing
4583164 everything you do should be a learning experience unless youre such an ego maniac you think everything you do is right and were not im glad that we did it the fans went away happy but my god it was probably one of the toughest things weve ever done who would think it was so tough to give something away free
4583165 we do try and shake things up and experiment were not the old donkey that plods on doing the same shit
4583166 the us and canada have become increasingly important territories for enslaved with their increasing sales and feedback from the fans and the scene both within and outside hard line metal the two tours we did in 2007 proved our live show qualities to the scene and the scene proved its dedication to us we are therefore extremely happy to be working with nuclear blast a formidable force in the record industry having met members of the u s staff on several occasions we know that their dedication and professionalism will take enslaved a great step further vertebrae is by far our strongest album one that we are extremely proud to present to the u s to canada mexico and all other territories we are very pleased to present it in tandem with nuclear blast
4583167 this bill might be one of the most important bills of this year
4583168 every single cost is going up and this government must implement some initiative that will offer relief to small businesses
4583169 but we cannot forget the local businesses that are here
4583170 if we do not begin offering some relief to small businesses we will have a major economic catastrophe in the virgin islands
4583171 while the tax relief that would be granted per taxpayer each month appears minimal the cumulative impact is great to the general fund
4583172 that is essentially important if we are to maintain our integrity on the bond market
4583173 these efforts will continue in the north shore until our manpower is at a level that will allow the department to dedicate eight officers for this project
4583174 i speak for all the residents who are tired of being left unprotected by the police department
4583175 we are so far away from an active police station that it is impossible for them to reach us in time to deter a crime and unfortunately the criminals are well aware of that
4583176 we want to ensure that we develop and implement labor policies to effectively manage the human resource needs in the territory while at the same time recognizing those persons who have demonstrated a long term commitment to the territory
4583177 i dont think theres any doubt that the nature of the offense is a serious one
4583178 the parties who have spoken today everyones alluded to public corruption how it affects the community and the blight it causes
4583179 it is the defendants corrupt and illegal activities that are the cause of this anguish and despair
4583180 it is the defendants corrupt and illegal activities that led to them losing their careers disgracing their families losing their reputations and losing the respect of the community
4583181 this has shaken if not shattered the publics faith in honest government
4583182 so the promise that was there when mr plaskett came back from law school could be realized
4583183 the embarrassment and shame i have brought my family is almost unspeakable and immeasurable particularly after being held in such high regard by the community

4583186 it was presented to me by 12 women in this very courtroom
4583187 none of the appeals from brazil india south africa and venezuela received the support for further processing of two thirds of the members of the iso technical management board and iec standardization management board as required by iso iec rules governing the work of their joint technical committee iso iec jtc 1 information technology
4583188 this is expected to take place within the next few weeks on completion of final processing of the document and subject to no further appeals against the decision
4583189 an unprecedented number of national bodies engaged collaboratively and constructively in the open xml standardization process with 61 countries voting to approve open xml as an international standard is 29500
4583190 we look forward to is 29500 being published and we will continue to support the iso iec process in every way that we can
4583191 in office client interoperability and the open xml file formats
4583192 the exact release date for office 2007 sp2 has not been announced yet but we expect odf support to be available sometime in the first half of 2009
4583193 lost in translation interoperability issues for open standards odf and ooxml as examples
4583194 governments are moving away from microsofts proprietary doc format to open standard document formats such as the opendocument format odf and office open xml ooxml
4583195 the belief is that by shifting to open standards governments will benefit from choice competition and the ability to seamlessly substitute different vendor implementations

4583386 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4583387 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4583388 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road

4583393 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4583394 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4583395 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4583396 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4583397 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4583398 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4583399 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4583400 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4583401 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4583402 fear of flying and quoted it to friends making me an icon and knowing exactly what your sun sign meant about you
4583403 to those who say stop dreaming and face reality i say keep dreaming and make reality
4583404 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4583405 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4583406 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4583407 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4583408 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4583409 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4583410 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4583411 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4583412 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4583413 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4583414 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4583415 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4583416 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4583417 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4583418 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4583419 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4583420 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4583421 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4583422 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4583423 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4583424 we have avoided taking this step as long as possible
4583425 to take a hard look at their businesses before the web started to hurt big time
4583426 risked alienating readers by printing colour photos on the front page and launched a sassy sunday edition the measures helped stop a slide in readership die welt created a tabloid edition that helped lure younger readers and the papers dared to raise prices even bild aimed at a working class audience in july boosted its newsstand price by 20 percent to about 90 cents in most markets the hikes along with digital revenue helped offset the loss in ads

4583434 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4583435 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4583436 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4583437 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4583438 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4583439 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4583440 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4583441 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4583451 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
4583452 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
4583453 it is to our understanding that pastor warren simply contacted senators mccain and obama to invite them to participate in this forum
4583454 we feel that the addition of congressman bob barr to this event will expand the debate on issues and benefit those who watch and learn from the forum the dialogue between the three main candidates in this election will educate and inform voters more so than a forum that restricts the discussion to the frequently heard talking points of senators obama and mccain

4583465 we also have concerned citizens fixing this stuff kids are running small park strips cleaning them up people are fixing park benches
4583466 politicians are excited because they know for instance from the site monitor poll just how many people want a new crosswalk
4583467 we can generate reports weekly or monthly and drill down by keyword this could generate work orders or if someone reports graffiti on an at amp t box at amp t could have an ongoing message thanking them for reporting it and providing information about the boxes or if someone reports a pothole the city could let them know if that whole road is due for re paving in a month

4583520 one idea is to get a new prepaid sim card and sms this person if you can get someone elses nic to obtain the connection that would be a bonus considering everyones drivers and the drivers servant has a brokerage account at the kse a sim card should be a relatively straightforward process

4583557 the presence of women in social and economic activities is more visible now than it was in the past they are working in different fields including garment industry

4583562 the fall in commodities is allowing the market to look beyond the short term inflation shock and towards the weak growth and longer term inflation outlook this is an argument in favor of the dollar and against the euro and sterling as markets move to price in rate cuts
4583563 at the same time following this weeks u s cpi and trade data it looks like the second quarter for the u s will look strong in terms of growth as well as inflation and that makes the current 2 percent fed fund target unrealistically low

4583572 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4583573 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4583574 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4583575 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4583585 will they all be there was this all bologna will i call and the phone is disconnected you know well i get there and my god there they were waiting for me they were two respectful gentlemen one was a cop that was wounded so he is on administrative paid leave right now and the other was an ex corrections officer they made sure that i got in a decent hotel and we talked for about an hour and a half there was a big storm that night and we agreed to meet the next morning then they gave me the creatures dna and they said here we want you to take this and run it through they didnt want to show me the body yet at that point we were pretty much just breaking bread
4583586 it was a euphoric experience for me after 35 years of searching for this thing it just blew me away there i was face to face with this thing it was about 7 feet tall and it weighs over 500 pounds it had five fingers and five toes very much like a human his feet were in excess of 16 inches and his hands from the palm to the middle finger were in excess of 11 inches the teeth were protruding because rigor mortis had set in and the tongue was out its guts were also out of its stomach and it looked like the gasses in the body caused this because they had this thing since june 10 or 12 i dont remember exactly but they had it for about two months they were afraid they didnt know what to think about what they had
4583587 one of them stayed with the body for nine hours while the other one went to go get help and the truck they had to get this thing out by hand and it took a total of four guys a day and a half to do it while they were doing that they were hearing something one of them took video of another creature that was following them and they said they saw three of them in the course of a day and a half
4583588 there is a minimum of 3 500 of these things a maximum of 7000 in north america alone
4583589 i was the biggest skeptic in the world until i had my first encounter

4583591 there are a lot of skeptics and naysayers out there and rightfully so until they get to see it until they get to touch it they got minds of their own but i am telling you right now what i saw was real and what i touched was real

4583602 last season we ranked in the upper third of the nhl in spending and we will spend more in 2008 09 however it is my policy not to identify publicly how much we will spend in the coming year to reveal an exact number would allow agents and other teams a strategic advantage i can say it is my philosophy not to spend to the cap why two reasons above all others
4583603 there have been five major offer sheets since 1996 only one dustin penner was not matched in four of five of those instances the signing or new team missed the playoffs and once came in dead last in the nhl philadelphia in 2006 2007 in all of these instances the new team was desperate which suggests that good organizations with respect to both history and an objective rate of return analysis will not be in the rfa market this summer
4583604 in our evaluations of the 30 teams we project 39 openings league wide for top 6 forwards or top 3 defensemen but only 18 players meet the description the demand far outweighs the supply which should guarantee that most if not all of those 18 players sign contracts for more money than they merit this lack of top end supply is why so few players have signed extensions with their own teams the last couple of months and why some teams have been willing to give up a draft pick or two for the right to negotiate with another teams top ufa player

4583606 my boss brought to me an original copy of the october 17 1972 life magazine featuring a story on the amazing new polaroid land camera what i loved however were the ads inside the magazine one was for the brand new sony u matic videocassette recorder some of the claims made in the ad copy were way out there so its funny to read it now and laugh
4583607 the uses of this little machine boggle the mind it could for instance solve one of the biggest problems in the conquest of cancer
4583608 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to our destruction should it come at all will be
4583609 how many times will they mobilize thousands of soldiers to overcome this local agitation
4583610 this is action based on what are seen as the lessons of the failure to save gush katif which are giving rise to a more militant activist approach
4583611 the first instruction is to come to the outpost as quickly as people can
4583612 people should block the traffic and prevent any kind of transportation along the road
4583613 the methodology of security forces is a quick arrival at an outpost and a quick destruction before protestors arrive
4583614 it is time to change the way we approach the struggle
4583615 this is an example of how the boundaries of the struggle are being determined by the settlers
4583616 police will continue to examine and carry out the security issues in judea and samaria as takes place in the other five districts around the country
4583617 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4583618 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4583619 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the pre season flows so differently that you dont know how long the defence is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4583620 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4583621 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4583622 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays

4583624 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4583625 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4583626 it would have been an easier off season for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4583627 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4583628 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there

4583651 love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always preserves love never fails

4583660 we had questions that ranged from 400 haircuts to flag lapel pins to whether they candidates believed in evolution i dont recall a single question on government operations
4583661 that is a dramatic oversight and one that will be extraordinarily costly if thats indicative of the attention the candidates will pay to the issue
4583662 neither candidate has responded at all to the cascade of problems weve had over the past six months with government performance
4583663 the candidates dont seem to have an agenda for addressing things like aircraft groundings or toxic trailers or leaded toys you could really go to town on government failure right now
4583664 the campaigns ought to be looking to fill the chief executive officer positions with management professionals prioritizing management experience over political connections
4583665 these positions are not political prizes and they fall to the bottom of the pile thats a mistake
4583666 that is predictable from 50 years of presidential action on management

4583689 mccains campaign manager was lead lobbyist for the deal now thousands of ohio jobs at risk
4583690 its now clear that the obama campaigns attack on john mccain and the dhl issue which obama campaign manager david plouffe called the most important development in the campaign is based on a lie
4583691 sen obama believes a focus on the middle class is appropriate in the wake of the first economic expansion on record where the typical familys income fell by almost 1 000

4583736 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4583737 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4583738 we are not against general musharraf as a person but we are against the dictators who have subverted the constitution of pakistan they should be made to stand trial
4583739 if the courts find any evidence against him it is for them to decide if the penalty will be death or a life sentence
4583740 he will remain the center of a lot of political attention a lot of anger a lot of resentment and possibly even some revenge
4583741 if he stays it wont be the life of a normal citizen
4583742 it expresses a longing an underlying sadness for something or someone thats been missing in your life and never quite sure if it will ever return in this case for us its rock and roll saudades de rock

4583771 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4583772 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4583773 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u
4583774 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4583775 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4583776 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4583777 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional ceasefire
4583778 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4583779 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4583780 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4583781 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4583782 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4583783 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4583784 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4583785 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4583786 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4583787 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4583788 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4583789 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4583790 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4583791 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4583792 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4583793 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4583794 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4583795 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4583796 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4583797 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4583798 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4583799 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4583800 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
4583801 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4583802 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
4583803 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it
4583804 foreign policy considering our current situation and possibilities is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward thinking
4583805 but owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors an awful awful lot in russia has yet to be lifted up from decline the overall state of peoples lives remains hard and chaotic
4583806 did not know if it was georgian russian or ossetian troops who opened fire
4583807 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4583808 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4583809 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4583810 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4583811 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4583812 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4583813 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4583814 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4583815 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4583816 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4583817 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4583818 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4583819 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4583820 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4583821 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4583822 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4583823 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4583824 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4583825 the cessation of hostilities announced by moscow has not yet reflected particularly into any improvement in terms of access for humanitarian aid workers
4583826 we appeal to all sides when we address humanitarian issues
4583827 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4583828 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4583829 the authorities in principle are ready to give us access but we are being told that there are ongoing security concerns
4583830 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4583831 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

4583835 mccain likes to brag that he took on jack abramoff
4583836 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4583837 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4583838 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there

4583997 i had no idea beforehand that tapestries were so affordable or even that they were available to the general public
4583998 my supplier offers a new product called pictureweave that im really fond of some of us in the industry call it photoweave that allows you to have your favorite photograph woven into an heirloom quality photo wall tapestry blanket pillow or tote bag in fact my son and i picked out a photograph to have reproduced into a tote bag and that picture has basically turned into my calling card and the logo for tapestry biz

4584396 the rhino incident has had a devastating impact on my life
4584397 my right leg was crushed by the rhinos roll bar the pain has been unbearable for over a year i was confined to bed while having to undergo seven surgeries i will never again be able to hike ski or participate in other outdoor activities that i enjoyed
4584398 the design flaws make the rhino dangerously susceptible to tipping and rolling even when being driven at slow speeds
4584399 i hope that my lawsuit sends yamaha a clear message that it must recall the rhino and fix its stability flaws before more riders are severely injured or worse killed
4584400 while its retrofit program was a step in the right direction yamaha has neither acknowledged nor addressed the rhinos core stability problems

4584402 i just think that first and foremost we have some unfinished business i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room on the field we got a great group of guys in the locker room i think thats all you can ask for and coaching coach belichick understands football and understands his players and really puts us together as one we come together as a team and thats what you can definitely respect playing in this profession playing in this league
4584403 im actually kind of nervous and the reason why is that i think about what we did last year as a whole unit
4584404 we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year i dont think we can really really live and dwell off that because that was last year like i said its a little bit of nervousness because i know how high the bar is here
4584405 the good thing that i can really say about our offense and im speaking for myself is that you had guys that came in late jabar gaffney myself chad jackson was hurt last year and welker coming in last year so for us to have a whole off season a training camp to really understand the offense and the concept is really scary thats why i say im nervous man because there is really no telling what were going to do so like i said the bar is set high and well see what happens
4584406 this was a place where it nearly happened four years ago when i went to denver
4584407 i was extremely impressed and always have admired this organization from afar you come out here and you have star players all over randy moss to tom brady to mike vrabel tedy bruschi rodney harrison you can go on and on richard seymour vince wilfork but to me the thing that has impressed me the most is the way they play the game i think they play it the right way they embody the sense of team as well as anyone thats led to the success i think everybody in the league wants to be a part of that never did i think i thought denver would be my last stop but things happen and im happy to be here
4584408 i think i functioned well on such little sleep i was out here early in the week went home to discuss it with my family felt good about the decision came back and learned the playbook in one night and got through it pretty good that was a good first day
4584409 well see i think you produce and things like that happen so thats what ill do ill just try to come out here and be the best i can be and see where that leads us
4584410 im looking forward to being here i think as i said for all the reasons this is a place where they utilize veteran guys very well and when someone has a track record youre interested in being a part of that so im extremely excited about being here
4584411 again i studied hard last night picking it up well see if they want me out there id love to be out there id love the opportunity in my old stomping grounds
4584412 you know if youve played football long enough its all similar concepts just different names for it that can be hard because old habits die hard and so you go through a translation you see a defense and say this is that but they did a great job getting me up to speed as i said i didnt get a whole lot of sleep but came out here and pulled it off for the first day so it was good
4584413 it was very close a lot of that experience as i said i never thought id i thought denver would be my last stop but i was always said that if i had an opportunity to come back here this would be a place where id love to play i think that experience helped me make my decision and hopefully helped them make their decision im very excited about it
4584414 i think everything people want to be involved with success the fact that theyve been very successful i think makes it a place where a lot of people want to be but you also understand that what theyve done in the past doesnt really stand for a whole lot right now we have to create another season by going out there every day and working our hardest this week its tampa looking forward to that test
4584415 very much so im from san diego so in offseasons and whatnot ive run into rodney a couple times weve always admired each others play it will be great to be able to play with him
4584416 i think our careers this is his 15th year my 16th so obviously when youre in the game i dont think so much measure but i studied him you try to emulate guys that are the best and take little parts of their game i think hes a guy ive always respected for the passion he plays with and the way he plays its going to be fun to play with him
4584417 hopefully we can both teach each other some things sometimes you learn things from young guys thats the great thing about this game youre never done learning you never have it figured out thats the challenge that keeps guys going
4584418 it was a wonderful four years everybody treated me incredibly i have no regrets i gave it everything i could there my only regret is that we didnt get done the ultimate goal denver still may be home for us so its nothing but positive thoughts there just thank you to the people there
4584419 i had the opportunity as i said to visit here a couple of years ago i played for him over at the pro bowl i have tremendous amount of respect for him and his knowledge of the game ive been very fortunate i played for the likes of bill walsh in college and in the nfl the shanahans the grudens the tony dungys im excited for the opportunity to play under him
4584420 i didnt even know someone else was in it and they were giving the other guy a hard time seeing that hes a rookie i dont think i have to do a whole lot they took care of the dirty business but ill take care of him ill take him out to dinner or something

4584765 with appropriately screened and prepared individuals under supportive conditions and with adequate supervision hallucinogens can be given with a level of safety that compares favorably with many human research and medical procedures
4584766 rarely in psychological research do we see such persistently positive reports from a single event in the laboratory this gives credence to the claims that the mystical type experiences some people have during hallucinogen sessions may help patients suffering from cancer related anxiety or depression and may serve as a potential treatment for drug dependence were eager to move ahead with that research
4584767 while some of our subjects reported strong fear or anxiety for a portion of their day long psilocybin sessions none reported any lingering harmful effects and we didnt observe any clinical evidence of harm

4584802 the lincoln mkt reinforces our commitment to further expand americas fastest growing luxury brand providing an all new vehicle to the showroom thats been crafted and honed for a new kind of customer
4584803 the mkt will offer the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a crossover and the performance of a sports sedan courtesy of its ecoboost engine
4584804 at the same time this perfect blend of performance and power is elegantly wrapped in the refined design cues that have become synonymous with modern lincolns
4584805 ecoboost engine technology is another symbol of what luxury means today
4584806 lincolns should drive as beautifully as they look delivering as much refinement on the road as their designs do even while standing perfectly still
4584807 embracing the same spirit as the concept the lincoln mkts design represents harmony in motion balancing sculptured shapes and contours traditionally associated with beautiful cars on a crossover vehicle that offers the luxury of space and efficient powerful performance

4584814 sometimes information that comes to light after an authors death can alter the manner in which one views his works for example a posthumously published letter by author arthur koestler revealed that he must have been totally wasted when he wrote the book further he totally did not remember asserting that while the capitalist democracies were bad that the communist dictatorships were worse because everyone knows communism rocks discuss s work in light of these revelations
4584815 political correctness and multiculturalism are defunct ideas from the 80s and dont exist in academics anymore its ridiculous for any intelligent academic to bring up such nonsense it simply does not exist in the real world of the college we teach a standardized canon in the college today as it always has been and anyone who tries to bring up pc is merely trying to discredit our tradition of inquiry and research thats just some misguided bitter clinging to an outdated past of old dead white guys only when the department has rightly progressed to a higher more expansive level
4584816 sayid affirmed that he and his brother barack sr were both born into a religious islamic family and were raised as muslims
4584817 while kenya is approximately 85 percent christian a muslim minority dates back to 1730 when arabs from oman began occupying eastern africa dislodging the portuguese colonists and taking over the slave trade in the eastern african coastal states including both kenya and tanzania listening to sayid there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing even if his devotion as a muslim remained in doubt the facts are that the obama family in africa is a muslim family of the predominantly christian luo tribe in the predominantly christian country of kenya

4584829 the consequences are worrying the risk is that the trial itself cannot be conducted in the way that it should be conducted or indeed that the trial will have to be adjourned or stayed until this problem can be sorted out no one wants that this is a serious case it needs to be heard
4584830 we would not expect any cases to be delayed for lack of an appropriate advocate and solicitors have told the legal services commission that they expect to be able to find counsel of the requisite experience to act in very high cost cases

4584838 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4584839 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4584840 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4584841 i was in high school when she hit it big
4584842 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4584843 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4584844 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4584845 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4584846 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4584847 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4584848 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4584849 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4584850 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4584851 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4584852 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4584853 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4584854 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4584855 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4584856 ill never get caught but if i do ill survive

4584859 most of those surveyed in germany britain and australia think china either has already replaced the u s or will do so in the future
4584860 the perception that china fails to consider the interests of others when making foreign policy decisions is widespread particularly in the u s middle east and among chinas neighbors south korea japan and australia
4584861 is a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world and sometimes in more than one region of the globe at a time
4584862 china is not now a superpower nor is it likely to emerge as one soon
4584863 lots of pretty unattractive policy options considering we dont really want to have war with either russia or china given the fact that were fighting two wars already
4584864 chinas relations with most of its neighbors are pretty good
4584865 it china would rather be on the same side of an international issue than at odds with us
4584866 compared to many other countries including our friends and allies china has been much less critical of u s actions in iraq
4584867 although levels of personal satisfaction are lower and by global standards chinese contentment with family income and jobs is not especially high these findings represent a dramatic improvement in national contentment from earlier in the decade when the chinese people were not nearly as positive about the course of their nation and its economy
4584868 broad acceptance among the chinese of their countrys transformation from a socialist to a capitalist society
4584869 clear majorities favor having the games in nigeria 79 percent tanzania 78 percent and india 76 percent
4584870 for the first time in nearly a century we see leadership in basic research and the economic ability to pursue the benefits of that research to create and market products based on research in more than one place on the planet
4584871 now we have a situation in which technology products are going to be appearing in the marketplace that were not developed or commercialized here we wont have had any involvement with them and may not even know they are coming
4584872 have been dramatic and there is no real sense that any kind of leveling off is occurring
4584873 china has really changed the world economic landscape in technology
4584874 when you take chinas low cost manufacturing and focus on technology then combine them with the increasing emphasis on research and development the result ultimately wont leave much room for other countries
4584875 its like being 40 years old and playing basketball against a competitor whos only 12 years old but is already at your height
4584876 you are a little better right now and have more experience but youre not going to squeeze much more performance out the future clearly doesnt look good for the united states
4584877 these emerging superpowers through the sheer size of their respective populations and coupled with increasing access to education and technology may become contenders for international dominance even before reaching the income per capita levels of the developed nations of today
4584878 chinas behavior during the sars epidemic when it hid what was going on and lied to the international community suggests that it is not ready for that type of leadership
4584879 we saw more openness after the sichuan earthquakes but the fundamental system remains the same
4584880 signal to the rest of the world that china has arrived
4584881 more open more transparent and more tolerant but this will not be achieved overnight it will take time
4584882 but i hope the olympics serve as a wake up call
4584883 china is nowhere close to becoming a world financial center
4584884 dramatic economic growth must continue indefinitely a prospect about which there are grounds for skepticism
4584885 chinas rise further depends critically on the continuation of such economic growth rates and there are reasons to wonder how long the spectacular rates of the past 25 years can continue
4584886 the high proportion of chinas economy occupied by its exports makes it sensitive to the ups and downs of the international economy generally and to the engine of american consumption in particular
4584887 the u s isnt going to disintegrate into a backwater economy
4584888 but if you scan the contributing factors to technology driven economic prominence the chinese upside is far greater they are educating more scientists and engineers their government puts a high priority on technical capability and entrepreneurial activity if you look at our educational system especially k 12 our investment savings rate debt and so on prospects are scary
4584889 after seeing the link between the countrys energy dependence and our failed foreign policy approach first hand i decided to go back to school to work towards a more effect national energy policy

4584901 ill never get caught but if i do ill survive
4584902 what he edwards wanted was sex how can you blame him after all what else is there look around the desire for sex dominates much of our culture from
4584903 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4584904 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4584905 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4584906 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4584907 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4584908 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4584909 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4584910 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4584911 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4584912 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4584913 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4584914 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4584915 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4584916 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4584917 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4584918 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4584919 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4584920 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4584921 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4584922 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4584923 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4584924 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4584925 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4584926 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4584927 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4584928 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4584929 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4584930 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4584931 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4584932 it is essential that drivers on rural roads drive carefully and vigilantly
4584933 today we can make the equipment small enough to fit in a medical van
4584934 there are a large number of patients at our clinic sites that are not getting primary eye care
4584935 it is very important especially for children to get eye exams
4584936 just from being homeless i know a lot of people who need glasses and basic health care

4584942 weve had calls placed to pastor warren from very powerful leaders from the left and the right we sent in our personal request and placed numerous phone calls that have not been returned you are not going to be included
4584943 our only option left is to threaten to file an temporary injunction as our attorneys believe they are in violation of the law
4584944 on sept 7 2006 nouriel roubini an economics professor at new york university stood before an audience of economists at the international monetary fund and announced that a crisis was brewing in the coming months and years he warned the united states was likely to face a once in a lifetime housing bust an oil shock sharply declining consumer confidence and ultimately a deep recession he laid out a bleak sequence of events homeowners defaulting on mortgages trillions of dollars of mortgage backed securities unraveling worldwide and the global financial system shuddering to a halt these developments he went on could cripple or destroy hedge funds investment banks and other major financial institutions like fannie mae and freddie mac
4584945 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4584946 this is a planning took where all things are going
4584947 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4584948 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4584949 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4584950 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4584951 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4584952 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4584953 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4584954 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4584955 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4584956 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4584957 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4584958 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4584959 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4584960 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4584961 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4584962 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4584963 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4584964 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4584965 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4584966 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4584967 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4584968 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4584969 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4584970 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4584971 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4584972 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4584973 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4584974 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4584975 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4584976 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4584977 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4584978 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4584979 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4584980 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4584981 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4584982 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4584983 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4584984 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4584985 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4584986 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4584987 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4584988 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4584989 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4584990 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4584991 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4584992 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4584993 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4584994 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4584995 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4584996 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4584997 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4584998 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4584999 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4585000 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4585001 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4585002 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4585003 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4585004 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4585005 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4585006 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4585007 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4585008 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4585009 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4585010 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4585011 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4585012 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4585013 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4585014 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4585015 are you sure you have tested an actually i do have a fee only advisor lined up as well as a cpa and estate planning attorney should this actually finally end
4585016 our staff has been touched by the generosity of our host cities and the american neighbor program is our small way of saying thank you
4585017 it is fitting that the program reached the 1 000 hour milestone while working on a home for sergeant marcus kuboy an american hero who epitomizes senator mccains call to serve a cause greater than self interest
4585018 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4585019 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4585020 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4585021 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4585022 they were filled with the fearlessness of those who have lost everything the fearlessness which is not easy to come by but which endures

4585060 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards of sportsmanship but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics
4585061 i mean there is an umpire it was love all 8 9

4585065 if a group of indie kids pass a group of emos in town we wouldnt acknowledge them theyre just so whinny and irritating
4585066 i think thats why emo gets labelled whiny in heavy metal for example a lot of the themes revolve around crisis or struggle but also about overcoming that from strength you overcome adversity emo seems to be much more an expression of the struggle the actual depression itself
4585067 hannah was a happy 13 year old until she became an emo part of a sinister teenage craze that romanticises death three months later she hanged herself her devastated mother tells other parents no child is safe

4585109 its my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it and to be honest with you i had a ball out there
4585110 its exciting regardless of whether you guys write me off or whatever you did that last year and not only insulted or disappointed myself but my family but i tell you what i came back and im looking forward to next year you cant take this moment away from me no matter how much you write it off
4585111 are you kidding me if i came out here and spoke to you and said i didnt want to be back i would have told you that but actually leaving there and thinking i missed that final i dont actually like that feeling and want to get ready for next years final

4585117 i didnt actually want to be in the lead coming into the straight but that will give me a lot of confidence i beat a couple of good guys in that field who i think are sure finalists so to take the lead confidently and feel that good with 200 metres to go gives me a lot of confidence

4585198 para ser sincero ya he pasado bastante tiempo entre carreras analizando los datos y manteni ndome en buena forma este descanso veraniego me ha dado la oportunidad de alejarme de eso y centrarme solo en recargar pilas viendo la temporada hasta ahora parece un campeonato distinto al del a o pasado el 2007 fue muy intenso y la consistencia era muy importante este a o los resultados de todos han sido m s variados y todo piloto que ha ganado una carrera tambi n se ha visto incapaz de conseguir puntos en al menos otras dos ocasiones eso hace que conseguir buenos resultados sea a n m s importante pero creo que veremos que la consistencia se hace crucial a medida que avanzamos hacia el final de la temporada

4585202 la victoria no cambia mucho en realidad a n creo que estoy mejorando y aprendiendo m s del equipo y del coche en cada carrera mi objetivo para la ltima parte de la temporada es ganar m s carreras y estar habitualmente entre los primeros es algo que he podido hacer algunas veces en la primera mitad del a o pero ahora me siento m s seguro de poder estar regularmente entre los primeros en las pr ximas carreras

4585423 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4585424 all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4585425 this is a cease fire agreement between us and the russians facilitated by france and the united states
4585426 and we certainly should move from this temporary arrangement to an international peacekeeping force on the ground to replace the occupiers
4585427 grew up with the idea that it should never happen again
4585428 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside

4585493 preserving the territorial integrity of georgia will not be possible without preserving the territorial integrity of serbia in kosovo and metohija province
4585494 it is unacceptable to recognize the unilateral independence of kosovo province from serbia and at the same time keep repeating the territorial integrity of georgia must be respected when it comes to south ossetia and abkhazia
4585495 if we all respect the territorial integrity of serbia in regards to its kosovo province then we are also going to honor the territorial integrity of georgia but if someone doesnt respect serbias territorial integrity and sovereignty over kosovo and metohija then they better shut up about the territorial integrity of georgia
4585496 pretend nothing happened in south ossetia as if there was no bombardment of the civilian population massacre of minorities and murder of the russian peacekeepers committed by tbilisi
4585497 what nato did in yugoslavia slaughter of civilians destruction of the bridges on danube razing the belgrade television and the rest takes away their right to criticize russia for any present of future actions

4585526 hes comfortable in possession of a football you get a double bonus there a good defender and he can use the ball i think thats what the modern game requires and thats what fabricios got
4585527 hes been around the training now for three or four days hes fitted comfortably into anything we can play
4585528 fabricio can play different positions he can play both sides of the centre back and he play left back and right back he can also play holding midfield that covers you in a lot of positions
4585529 that makes him a fantastic acquisition for me as manager because it means if we get an injury in a certain place i can use his experience and it wont faze him to play anywhere so this is a fantastic signing for us

4585542 so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4585543 i said they the tax cuts had to be accompanied by spending reductions
4585544 he did not support them because they were not balanced by spending cuts
4585545 said he has always favored lower taxes but wanted them coupled with a reduction in spending
4585546 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4585547 i voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthy americans i would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit but the middle income tax credits the families the child tax credits the marriage tax credits all of those i would keep
4585548 i respectfully disagree i said the tax cuts had to be accompanied by spending reductions
4585549 im somewhat concerned that you flipped on some maverick positions

4585569 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4585570 we certainly hope that any actions that they take are consistent with the rule of law and constitutional principles but i want to be clear these are matters for the pakistanis to determine
4585571 i urge the parties the pakistani military and president musharraf to resolve this crisis within the bounds of pakistani law and i urge the bush administration to refrain from any actions which might appear to thwart the will of the pakistani people
4585572 it is hoped that the bush administration has finally come around to the realization that they cannot prop up musharraf any longer
4585573 this is just a way of making clear that senator biden is not trying to prop up musharraf and is urging the bush administration to also be careful not to give that impression
4585574 the government will issue necessary orders at the earliest to implement the decision of the union government regarding the recommendations of the sixth pay commission for union government employees to the satisfaction of more than 10 lakh employees of the government of tamil nadu
4585575 the expectations of the people are also going up earlier 40 000 deliveries were done in primary health centres but last year the figure went up to 1 83 lakh
4585576 for many years they have been demanding timescale of pay this government has decided to grant them a separate special timescale of pay
4585577 among them a situation exists wherein employees working for more than 25 years are getting the same salary as the new recruits this government has decided to provide an increment for every 10 years of service and increase the pay based on seniority
4585578 due to these decisions benefiting 2 2 lakh employees the government will incur an additional recurring expenditure of rs 200 crore per year
4585579 it was not easy for he is the world champion but once i levelled the score i knew i cannot lose

4585581 i know things would not be easier in fact it would get even more difficult from now onwards but im here to do my job and return with the gold if luck decides the outcome i may return with the bronze but if confidence is the determining factor gold is mine
4585582 only akhil can do that he was all along confident and he proved that it was not mere wishful thinking on his part we are so proud of him
4585583 the job however is not done yet even though the win would fill him with more confidence trailing 2 6 few would have come out winner but he managed that he is supremely confident and knows what he is going to do
4585584 we just could not figure out what roger was doing in the court he proved why he is among the all time greats probably you cannot do much when you have the best player in the world on the other side of the net and with him a player who does not miss anything

4585587 we played our hearts out it is heartbreak but we got stuck with roger federer playing unbelievable tennis
4585588 we came in as prepared as we could possibly be we have always delivered playing for the country we havent delivered an olympic medal yet
4585589 i think the lead was important it was good to sleep well and start off on a positive mindset and continue what we have been doing
4585590 we expected it to be much tougher but in a best of three set doubles match anything can happen
4585591 they are a tough doubles team but we played together

4585604 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4585606 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4585607 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4585608 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4585609 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4585610 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4585611 if washington under london pressure and manipulation does go ahead and sanction the ouster of president musharraf this will lead to increased instability and overall disaster that will soon spread from south asia into southwest and central asia as well
4585612 i strongly urge that cooler heads prevail and that before president musharraf is kicked out the door the consequences of such an ouster be fully considered

4585616 t he u s dollars recent rise is largely attributable to market expectations of a bottom in u s short term interest rates coupled with a diminishing likelihood of further ecb tightening
4585617 if you see commodity prices coming off more at least some dollar appreciation will be reflected
4585618 its very rare for the fed to talk about the value of the dollar
4585619 u s growth will probably be sideways for a number of quarters to come rates should stay on hold which should limit the amount of dollar appreciation from here
4585620 loan losses are likely to be higher for all banks than estimated earlier and that includes wells fargo
4585621 the opportunities to expand the customer base in bad times should meaningfully enhance the banks secular opportunities in good times
4585622 wells fargo continues to be the only bank in the u s to be rated aaa continues to grow has a strong balance sheet and has the strongest capital ratios in our peer group
4585623 given the companys diversification wells fargo continues to perform well during the current economic cycle just as it has endured through all kinds of economic cycles during our 156 year history
4585624 it dramatically overpaid for bear stearns to help the financial markets wells does not make a mistake like this
4585625 most banks that have cdos have written off amounts that are many multiple times the size of the wells fargo total portfolio

4585670 i know abraham and he was onto something big even i was dumb enough to see that
4585671 ive seen what abraham talks about i know it sounds crazy
4585672 jim everyone is going to miss abe but we dont have to make stories
4585673 im not making stories abe told me about the things over there he said they were dangerous he warned me against them
4585674 they will lock you back in your room because of his death the doctor has given you another chance after yesterday
4585675 just take it easy mourn your friend but honor him dont make his passing harder than it is and remember there is court for you today
4585676 nope its those sleeping pills man they feed them to us like candy
4585677 what choice do we have were prisoners man just look at you youve been in confinement for a week
4585678 you always have a choice mark just like abe had one
4585679 well for one thing i know abe didnt take the pills he had a way to cough them back up
4585680 you think abe went through one of those doors dont you like he was always talking about
4585681 i dont know what happened exactly but i know he didnt have a heart attack if they said you had one that would be different but abe was young fit and he ran when he could
4585682 its t0he doctor man hes poisoning us he gives us all these medications that we dont need
4585683 you know that the dimentions are real dont you abe talked to you plus you shared his room when he first came here do you think something is up about all this
4585684 remember how abe talked about the things on the other side
4585685 remember how he said that if you moved around the things would notice you and then quickly tear you apart
4585686 do you really believe he went to different places why didnt he ever leave this place
4585687 he could go to a different dimention not across town
4585688 they got me on a diet now man this is all i get
4585689 help me and you can have my breakfast for a week
4585690 i think the medicine killed him its going to get us all especially our liver how many pills you on a day
4585691 i think he might have killed himself just so someone would think he went to another dimention
4585692 do you really think abe had a heart attack i mean he was only nineteen
4585693 good morning james how are you feeling today yesterday wasnt so good
4585694 you didnt have to have me locked away i was just telling you the truth and it still stands you cant force me to take anything and considering my roommate died last night i think its convienent that i was away
4585695 yes im sorry about that abe was a very special person
4585696 mark thinks you killed him with the sleeping medicine did you
4585697 james your getting close to that line we spoke about
4585698 hes right you know it wasnt a heart attack abraham overdosed on his sleeping pills he had only acted like he was swallowing them
4585699 it wasnt something from abrahams other dimention or marks wild idea about you poisoning everybody
4585700 perhaps i shouldnt have did that he has court today

4585705 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4585706 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4585707 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4585708 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4585709 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4585710 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4585711 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4585712 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4585713 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4585714 wow a newspaper is actually exposing injustice and reflecting the voice of the people
4585715 obviously people have the right to make claims through the legal process and well certainly review it and respond accordingly

4585725 i apologize for my actions i made a terrible mistake and i will take responsibility for that
4585726 i understand that i am the one who made the mistake not anyone else i was treated professionally and respectfully by the beavercreek police department
4585727 when i get a legal review of where we should go ill will discuss this with our city council and well take appropriate action
4585728 i think that whatever happens on a personal level does not reflect on the quality of the service that he provides to the citizens here he has the utmost integrity as far as the work that he provides
4585729 well it still stands that ketchup is not a priority make do with mustard
4585730 ill settle for that if the priority is in that order
4585731 why did you work so hard to get above a thing that fades away in
4585732 because it is not the length of time alone that gives value but the beauty itself my friend those few moments when i crossed above the rainbow they were worth the effort to see that beauty from above is next to dying
4585733 what a strange comparison isnt death something to be feared
4585734 no my friend life is beautiful but when you die you fly into an eternal experience more beautiful than anything ever seen on earth more beautiful than any rainbow and it is like going home after being away for a very long time

4585737 i hope that senator mccain selects a pro life running mate
4585738 if he doesnt i will take some comfort in him being pro life and hope that he would make sure that whoever his running mate may be would commit also to not changing any of the policies
4585739 i do believe that if there is a very clear contrast in that one candidate takes a solid pro life position and the other takes a position that is anything but it will be bring a coalition of pro life people to that candidate
4585740 we need to once again realize that there was a time when there were certain things negotiable which federal agencies should stay or go which programs ought to get more or less money but some things were not negotiable the sanctity of human life the definition of marriage the purpose of freedom and the opportunity for us to worship as we please let us never sacrifice our principles for anybodys politics not now not ever

4585750 immediate steps to stop state terrorism and prevent human rights violations in the indian occupied jammu and kashmir
4585751 how do you ask me to accept a lawyer when we have so many contradictions
4585752 you are the judge and i am the accused at the same time you are my enemy
4585753 to proceed without al bahlul mounting a defense would destroy any possibility of having an appearance of legitimacy and fairness
4585754 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4585755 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
4585756 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4585757 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4585758 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy
4585759 is acceptable in accordance with the laws that are given for reasons of general interest for the safety of others of society and for the common good in accordance with the provisions of articles 30 and 32 2 of the american convention on human rights this requirement is fully compatible with the provisions of articles 19 and 156 of the national constitution

4585762 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
4585763 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4585764 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4585765 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4585766 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4585767 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4585768 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4585769 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4585770 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4585771 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4585772 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4585773 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4585774 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4585775 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4585776 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
4585777 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
4585778 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
4585779 how are your own views of iraq affected by your study of washingtons experience leading a rebellion against a british military occupation
4585780 a leading forecaster of advertising spending has reduced again his prediction for growth this year joining other analysts who have cut their estimates because of the troubled american economy and difficulties among media like newspapers and radio
4585781 the internet has been either dramatically underpriced or offline media is dramatically overpriced right now a reader of the wall street journal might be worth a dollar but for someone reading the online journal you get a nickel
4585782 these social networking sites are no different from traditional media properties we are holding these sites to an absurd standard the advertising allocations will follow the consumer and right now theyre badly out of whack
4585783 fair use for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching including multiple copies for classroom use scholarship or research is not an infringement of copyright

4585789 with amd npt we have come to a turning point it looks like exactly the right answer going forward and there is less memory overhead less than 5
4585790 large applications that users dont want to virtualize because of the possible performance overhead will benefit from rvi it is the next step in hardware assisted virtualization
4585791 with shadow paging the guest os and the hypervisor have duplicates so double the work is being done
4585792 because of the nature of nested page tables we see better results with larger workloads when looking at virtualization without npt
4585793 if i am running xen or vmware workloads against a database server i will see an improvement because it requires lots of memory and a lot of translating goes on we have also seen performance increases in web servers we also see improvements across the board with 64 bit applications
4585794 file servers dont offer the type of workload that nested paging can really improve on but if you give it a large database environment npt in rvi really becomes a benefit
4585795 you dont see a lot of clinical trial work presented in science
4585796 this is such cool stuff at least at the first pass
4585797 man id rather be out doing combat training than listening to all these dumb questions
4585798 the key to change is to let go of fear

4585801 our ability to protect our bottom line through rigorous expense control and effective inventory management was enhanced by good initial customer response to our new brand launches and the effectiveness of our promotional pricing actions
4585802 faz 10 anos desde que comecei a praticar corrida e triathlon nesta fase lembro me de que nas provas em que participava principalmente corridas n o havia muitas mulheres inclusive os homens al m de motivarem a gente durante as provas ficavam muitas vezes surpresos com a nossa participa o o problema era quando nosso desempenho era melhor do que o deles alguns n o se conformavam as pessoas de um modo em geral sempre acharam que esporte era quase que exclusivamente masculino
4585803 o meio do atletismo era totalmente masculino acho que sou uma das poucas mulheres que tiveram coragem de encarar o desafio nos anos 80
4585804 pelo olhar e pelas costas algumas vezes j aconteceu de eu sentir o preconceito mas verbalmente n o isso pode ocorrer na primeira impress o em um primeiro contato logo ap s esse tipo de atitude dissolvida
4585805 a hegemonia masculina pode at existir mas n o estamos preocupadas com isso o n mero de profissionais maior mas o contingente de corredores masculinos tamb m portanto gradativamente os espa os v o se ampliando a minha perspectiva de que as treinadoras consigam se colocar com trabalho diferenciado
4585806 basrawis realised what a nightmare literally that was theyre not going to put themselves back through that period of violent extremism
4585807 they have got better things to do now with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are passed
4585808 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4585809 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4585810 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4585811 we hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity
4585812 sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do
4585813 the defendants design was to operate a church oriented school which is free of any governmental regulation for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires
4585814 he preys on at least he did the people who believed in him
4585815 thanks to the christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country america has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other western nation
4585816 there is nothing injurious to sexuality its good and pleasant not an evil children exposed to it are simply not injured
4585817 do i have to worry about whats happening with my kids i have to try to do something
4585818 they have scars they say will never go away theyre frightened

4585839 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4585840 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4585841 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4585842 this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future

4586110 i have always supported the shield in poland im glad that the thing is finalised now there are so many weapons on the planet that the earth could be destroyed 10 times over
4586111 its obvious we dont need a new arms race but in the end im in favour of the shield the pros for polish security outweigh the cons its good that the americans will be here
4586112 since the berlin wall came down poland has become an absolutely booming economy there has been a rapid transformation and walking down the street in krakow or warsaw is like walking down any british high street

4586120 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4586121 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics

4586163 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice
4586164 at one point his own family wanted nothing to do with him and what happened was never talked about
4586165 he was so proud to be on the titanic which makes what happened to him all the more tragic
4586166 if the same thing happened today we would be much sympathetic to his plight because he went through very hard times it was dreadful for him
4586167 he was not to blame for what happened aboard the titanic or on the lifeboat
4586168 but afterwards he thought he was jinxed sailors are very superstitious people and nobody would give him a job
4586169 he was publicly shamed and humiliated and racked with guilt it was not fair he was a kind and gentle man
4586170 the first time i remember meeting him he was wearing a navy blue hat and a navy blue jumper
4586171 he patted me on the head and said youre a lovely looking maid that is how he spoke he was lovely it is so sad uncle robert never deserved all the punishment he took

4586174 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing he said in a statement

4586176 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase he said
4586177 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4586178 the letters also use positive words and especially avoid the word debt

4586201 but we didnt do the simple thing of upgrading the sans
4586202 what we wanted to do was provide ourselves with some flexibility
4586203 we could have easily upgraded those sans but 60 percent of the data on those sans was not used so we wanted to archive that
4586204 before it was running for nearly 12 hours in terms of a full backup but that has been cut in half with the work that we have done and we hope to get that down to about four or five hours
4586205 because we bought so much storage on the netapp devices we now have a lot of free disk space where we can do daily live backups
4586206 being able to cut the backup window is incredibly reassuring for the staff
4586207 we were having some issues where backups would over run and this caused issues for some file services and log on processes but that has been alleviated
4586208 we will get an roi almost immediately because we didnt have to upgrade our san
4586209 we looked across the board at hp emc and ibm archiving solutions
4586210 the reason that we went with symantec and netapp was purely around the flexibility of being able to use the disk storage for other means emc and hp were essentially appliances that were purely archiving solutions with storage
4586211 if we want to change our direction with the hp evas we have the flexibility to use the netapp storage that we purchased if necessary
4586212 we have also installed the netapp kit in some of our other health community sites its in two main data centers and two smaller data centers

4586230 when a muslim spends something on his family intending to receive allahs reward it is regarded as sadaqa for him
4586231 allah said o son of adam spend and i shall spend on you
4586232 the one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a mujahid warrior who fights for allahs cause or like him who performs prayers all the night and fasts all the day
4586233 i have property may i bequeath all my property in allahs cause
4586234 one third is alright yet it is still too much for youd better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor begging of others whatever you spend will be considered a sadaqa for you even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife anyhow allah may let you recover so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you
4586235 the prophet said the best alms is that which is given when one is rich and a giving hand is better than a taking one and you should start first to support your dependents a wife says you should either provide me with food or divorce me a slave says give me food and enjoy my service
4586236 o abu huraira did you hear that from allahs apostle
4586237 the best alms is that which you give when you are rich and you should start first to support your dependants
4586238 uthman abdurrahman bin auf az zubair and sad bin abi waqqas are seeking permission to meet you
4586239 yes so he admitted them and they entered greeted and sat down after a short while yarfa came again and said to umar shall i admit ali and abbas
4586240 o chief of the believers judge between me and this ali
4586241 i beseech you both by allah do you know that allahs apostle said that
4586242 i beseech you by allah do you both know that
4586243 when allah had taken his apostle unto him abu bakr said i am the successor of allahs apostle so he took charge of that property and did with it the same what allahs apostle used to do and both of you knew all about it then
4586244 you both claim that abu bakr was so and so but allah knows that he was honest sincere pious and right in that matter then allah caused abu bakr to die and i said i am the successor of allahs apostle and abu bakr so i kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule and i used to do the same with it as allahs apostle and abu bakr used to do later both of you ali and abbas came to me with the same claim and the same problem o abbas you came to me demanding your share from the inheritance of the son of your brother and he ali came to me demanding his wives share from the inheritance of her father so i said to you if you wish i will hand over this property to you on condition that you both promise me before allah that you will manage it in the same way as allahs apostle and abu bakr did and as i have done since the beginning of my rule otherwise you should not speak to me about it so you both said hand over this property to us on this condition and on this condition i handed it over to you i beseech you by allah did i hand it over to them on that condition
4586245 i beseech you both by allah did i hand it over to you both on that condition
4586246 do you want me now to give a decision other than that
4586247 o allahs apostle abu sufyan is a miser so is it sinful of me to feed our children from his property
4586248 no except if you take for your needs what is just and reasonable
4586249 if the wife gives of her husbands property something in charity without his permission he will get half the reward
4586250 so the prophet came to us when we had gone to bed we wanted to get up on his arrival but he said stay where you are
4586251 shall i direct you to something better than what you have requested when you go to bed say subhan allah thirty three times alhamdulillah thirty three times and allahu akbar thirty four times for that is better for you than a servant
4586252 subhan allah thirty three times alhamdulillah thirty three times and allahu akbar thirty four times all added i have never failed to recite it ever since
4586253 no even on the night of the battle of siffin
4586254 he used to work for his family and when he heard the adhan call for the prayer he would go out
4586255 o allahs apostle abu sufyan is a miser and he does not give me what is sufficient for me and my children can i take of his property without his knowledge
4586256 take what is sufficient for you and your children and the amount should be just and reasonable
4586257 the best women among the camel riders are the women of quraish
4586258 the righteous among the women of quraish are those who are kind to their young ones and who look after their husbands property
4586259 why not a virgin so that you might play with her and she with you and you might amuse her and she amuse you
4586260 abdullah my father died and left girls and i dislike to marry a girl like them so i married a lady matron so that she may look after them
4586261 i had sexual intercourse with my wife while fasting in the month of ramadan
4586262 o allahs apostle shall i give it to poorer people than us by him who sent you with the truth there is no family between medinas two mountains poorer than us
4586263 o allahs apostle shall i get a reward in the hereafter if i spend on the children of abu salama and do not leave them like this and like this i e poor but treat them like my children
4586264 yes you will be rewarded for that which you will spend on them
4586265 o allahs apostle abu sufyan is a miser is there any harm if i take of his property what will cover me and my childrens needs
4586266 i am closer to the believers than themselves so if one of the believers dies in debt i will repay it but if he leaves wealth it will be for his heirs
4586267 o allahs apostle will you marry my sister the daughter of abu sufyan
4586268 yes for i am not your only wife and the person i like most to share the good with me is my sister
4586269 o allahs apostle we have heard that you want to marry durra the daughter of abu salama
4586270 even if she were not my step daughter she is unlawful for me for she is my foster niece thuwaiba suckled me and abu salama so you should not present to me your daughters and sisters

4586276 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
4586277 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto

4586289 we are ready to go at any time from both north ossetia and from the georgian capital of tbilisi
4586290 we will be operational as soon as security guarantees are in place and were sure that its safe
4586291 we are now in full swing distributing supplies and restoring access to water in shelter centres in and around tbilisi
4586292 for us it is a question of access access access total and free to south ossetia around gori and also to the ports
4586293 we have asked when this would be possible and we were told that when the security situation allows we could enter
4586294 the response by russias emergencies ministry and local red cross is very comprehensive to health and food needs

4586307 we will always have to bargain with them because they will always be a major geopolitical power
4586308 especially when you have children and the summer days and they are playing into the night its a long time
4586309 john mccain actually said your privacy should not be protected that your privacy will be subject to the
4586310 with all thats gone on in georgia this will make it much easier for iran
4586311 to liberate muslims around the world and in iraq in particular from troops of darkness
4586312 today marks the end of the elitist and secretive paraguay famous for its corruption
4586313 the change is not just an election question the change in paraguay is a cultural challenge perhaps the most important in its history
4586314 this is a candidate who won the elections with almost no government program
4586315 lugo is going to have to show that he can form coalitions with the old party structure
4586316 and that is something that fox was not able to do in mexico lugo has no choice but to make deals and pursue allies to help carry out his policy agenda
4586317 that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police cooperate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide
4586318 at this time a wide majority of them have announced plans to waive extra baggage fees for military personnel traveling on orders or have never had a fee in place
4586319 we are strong supporters of lasting peace in mindanao as a way to achieve development we do not believe that independence for mindanao is appropriate
4586320 be a good deterrent to terrorism good for security and would help spur economic development in mindanao
4586321 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corp of the philippines
4586322 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere
4586323 i feel like i should have been up every round and every round was tied
4586324 i felt like the scoring wasnt right because i worked so hard for this and to come this far and lose in the first round it isnt right it doesnt seem real to me
4586325 are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4586326 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4586327 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4586328 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4586329 with its action in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4586330 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4586331 hoe zou ik er in die periode als volwassene uitgezien hebben

4586333 everyone is a terrorist and is going to kill us
4586334 i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything
4586335 if you torture one you create 10 100 1000 new enemies
4586336 its my way of the highway and if you dont like it stfu
4586337 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4586338 life would have been very different for all of us
4586339 it sort of brought it all back to the surface at the same time i had got on with my life i suppose i had to you see having older children but especially for the younger children
4586340 at the time you just couldnt sit about and feel sorry for yourself
4586341 theres been quite substantial snowfall in the last 36 hours
4586342 avalanche conditions have deteriorated in the duration of their trip thats not uncommon
4586343 they will be going down to get a closer detail on what efforts are being made and whats going on without interfering with the rescue effort obviously
4586344 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4586345 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4586346 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4586347 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4586348 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4586349 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4586350 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4586351 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4586352 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4586353 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4586354 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4586355 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4586356 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4586357 we know that our teachers and our unique educational approach at denver academy are keys to the success that our students experience
4586358 providing an inspiring space that facilitates both teacher and student is an essential component
4586359 i wish i had taken piano lessons so i want you to take piano lessons
4586360 we are happy to help casa offer folks such an easy way to help children who have been abused and neglected
4586361 all they have to do is come out and enjoy our wonderful food and a portion of their total bill will help make sure children are safe from further harm
4586362 i had an orgasm once but my doctor told me it was the wrong kind
4586363 really not me every one ive had was right on the money
4586364 im starting to get some feeling back in my jaw now
4586365 sex with you is really a kafka esque experience i mean that as a compliment
4586366 i think theres too much burden placed the orgams you know to make up for empty areas in life
4586367 show me where the exit are give me the light to where everything is
4586368 we know that our teachers and our unique educational approach at denver academy are keys to the success that our students experience
4586369 providing an inspiring space that facilitates both teacher and student is an essential component
4586370 we are happy to help casa offer folks such an easy way to help children who have been abused and neglected

4586377 you will be born again in a perhaps better life
4586378 i am announcing today that even though i have the law on my side i have decided not to pursue an election contest with the republican primary board
4586379 i love east tennessee and i love america therefore it is in the best interest of everyone concerned that i concede the election to my primary opponent i have contacted mr roe and made him aware of my decision
4586380 i would bet you a nickel that anyone who gets that letter a warning from someone theyve never heard of it goes right into the wastebasket
4586381 who are probably well versed in what they can and cant do with their campaign donations i cant imagine this doing much to impede their efforts
4586382 this might signal a new variety of tactic and counter tactic
4586383 if it were regarded as acceptable behavior to threaten to dig up any kind of dirt on persons simply because they contribute to a political campaign
4586384 it would be a disaster for our electoral system and if the situation became too extreme could delegitimize campaign disclosure requirements
4586385 were trying to diminish the power of the conservative movement
4586386 these letters are probably going to backfire recipients will be even more likely to open up their pocketbooks
4586387 the whole idea of intimidating people in the election process is nothing new
4586388 as the general election approaches the demand for on time travel payment is as important as ever
4586389 we believe a fifty thousand dollar monthly credit line per person is a safe estimate of what to expect in the coming months this estimate includes air and ground travel plus any miscellaneous costs that may arise throughout the week food power internet etc
4586390 the fact that they waited almost two months is usually a good sign for appellants
4586391 we received some information about the thai boat that was hijacked near somali waters but still it is not clear which company owns the ship and how many crew members were on board
4586392 actually i hit 16 greens yesterday and my putting felt good but i just wasnt matching the line well enough with the speed
4586393 so today i guess i did that better and made some more birdies which is nice my stroke feels good im sticking to my routine something my coach and i worked on last week and just carrying it over into this week
4586394 the power of the swift boat accusations was based on the fact that kerrys fellow officers believed him unfit to be commander in chief
4586395 now corsis obama book while selling well doesnt have the same impact if he had written it with to come up with a hypothetical several of the ministers who worked with obama in the 1980s who say he is unfit for office then that would have been a big story and comparable to the swift boat book but those ministers arent saying that this is not 2004
4586396 allegations falsehoods exaggerations or distortions to discredit a person or entity
4586397 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4586398 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4586399 literally within minutes of cracking open the pages we saw that the book was riddled with errors
4586400 these cuts are shocking and short sighted and they certainly arent business friendly
4586401 support for arts and culture are among the most efficient investments a government can make
4586402 the relatively small investments made by these programs have generated large returns over the years and their loss will severely limit the ability of the film television and new media sector to explore and exploit foreign marketing possibilities
4586403 whats really frustrating from our perspective is that the conservative government is removing a program that enables institutions to do what the government wants them to do which is become more responsible more businesslike more self sufficient
4586404 what we intend to do is to look at how we can create a new program or new avenues that will be even better performing and with a stronger impact for our culture abroad
4586405 it indicates to us that our fundraising continues to be very healthy
4586406 so well be spending much more than weve been raising
4586407 an uptick in internet receipts that continues to this day
4586408 to pay attention to the need to excite our base
4586409 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail waxman said
4586410 he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4586411 as a pastor i know that you can learn about a mans character based on how he treats his family
4586412 barack is a strong man of christian faith whos been married to his wife for 16 years
4586413 the republican party has had it pretty easy the past few years because theyve been able to take a position on a few issues abortion gay marriage to some degree stem cell research and be assured of religious support
4586414 i tell you the truth as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
4586415 i hope that what well see happen is that the faith and dialogue about faith in public life will deepen and mature rather than be focused on just a few wedge issues
4586416 since the senator is a christian i think its important for the voting population to understand his virtues and his values
4586417 an outstanding fabulous family man i dont know why thats not touted more
4586418 other than protection of the nation name one thing the government can do better than a free man or woman
4586419 beware of babylon where is the only place on earth one can find hammurabbis code of law
4586420 it was interesting then to see this report in the uk s daily mail about mrs
4586421 john 14 12 the one who believes in me shall do greater works than these
4586422 other than protection of the nation name one thing the government can do better than a free man or woman
4586423 i tell you the truth as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
4586424 so obamas supporters put together an ad showing what a committed christian obama is okay how odd that there isnt a single image or mention of the church where he became a christian or the pastor who married him and baptized his children why its almost like theyve got something to hide funny i didnt

4586428 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
4586429 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
4586430 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have reevaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders

4586432 si quiero reconocer la respuesta que han tenido tanto el gobierno federal como el del distrito federal y los gobernadores al llamado de m xico unido contra la delincuencia hace tres d as realmente pues si nos ha sorprendido la prontitud con la que el gobierno ha dado respuesta y si queremos reconocer que esto implica que saben que la responsabilidad es de ellos pero nosotros tambi n sabemos que los ciudadanos tenemos que colaborar en esto
4586433 que nos den tiempos porque b sicamente les vamos a ir contando a las autoridades que esto les quede claro queremos tambi n el compromiso de los medios de comunicaci n para poder dar seguimiento a todo esto

4586435 pretendemos que esto sea un ejemplo de lo que haremos en todos los sectores ste no debe ser el nico que tenga acercamiento con la ciudadan a la relaci n con los habitantes debe darse en todos los sectores
4586436 exigiremos de las autoridades el r pido esclarecimiento de los hechos y el castigo que corresponda a todos los responsables
4586437 vand licas actitudes no hay ning n prop sito de ejercicio de los derechos sindicales o participaci n pol tica sino un burdo intento de desestabilizaci n al servicio de los peores personajes e intereses que registra nuestra historia sindical

4586441 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion
4586442 she lived on the edge she was the first in her group to go skydiving the first to go bungee jumping

4586444 i started getting short of breath the last thing i remember was them administering oxygen to me the next thing i knew i woke up and i was hooked up to an artificial heart machine
4586445 he says to me mike youre going to get a heart today
4586446 there was just something in the way he wrote that letter that made me want to reach out and make sure he was doing ok and that he would continue doing well
4586447 it was a feeling of i know these people it was unbelievable

4586481 how can you get over loosing someone who was such a tremendous part of your life
4586482 it can happen it can happen to anyone to the popular kids it can happen to anyone just dont drink and drive
4586483 many otherwise good people drink and drive because they believe that its ok or are embarrassed to admit theyre not in control
4586484 these are hunters people and im happy to be back with them
4586485 hunter would be back here drinking and having fun but i dont know if he could have tolerated the repression

4586489 what i want to know is can you watch something that can change you
4586490 for the last three years i vowed to get to the center of what i know im a part of which is one of the greatest bands in the world today
4586491 my intent was to make you sick to your stomach
4586492 it was said to me very early in my career that rock n roll is 23 hours of hell and one hour of god

4586498 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
4586499 shes a personal hero of mine i think its amazing what shes accomplished
4586500 i think its great for my children to have someone local and someone that theyve met and seen to be a good role model for them to follow
4586501 its just awesome that it doesnt matter where youre from as long as you have the heart for it you can do well no matter what it is
4586502 i wish i had an answer to that because im tired of answering that question
4586503 hey thats a nice jacket you look familiar wanna buy what im selling

4586510 oky class what is the author trying to say in this piece anyone anyone oky howbout for years ann coulter with her wit and wisdom has screwed moderate socialist democrats in da butt without so much as the slightest credible response from them failing this their only alternative was to create a work of fiction in which they dream of literally screwing the lady in da butt yes no
4586511 alright class what else does this say that we all get it in the end
4586512 i just came across your blog about keyword and wanted to drop you a note telling you how impressed i was with the information you have posted here
4586513 well he cant help himself hes a right wing religious zealot so of course hes going to think like that
4586514 republicans who never served in war are hypocrites to send young men to die
4586515 the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time
4586516 werent able to properly explain to the country what the real issues were
4586517 you are repeating a very right wing characterization of what democrats are arguing against
4586518 here are some arguments that are being made that the democratic party has simply not responded to in the larger sense of the word
4586519 where did we go wrong how can we correct ourselves
4586520 what would bush have to do to lose your support
4586521 you want to save cells that you but not the majority of the science community think is the beginnning of life
4586522 a leader must have a character he must have a solid core an identity he must stand for something for fall for anything
4586523 wholesome apple pie rhetoric the we are better than all other countries the we are exceptional because we are believers
4586524 our error is that we democrats are far less understanding than we think we are
4586525 well he cant help himself hes a right wing religious zealot so of course hes going to think like that
4586526 bigotry isnt pretty but it shouldnt surprise anyone that most of the country has no interest in
4586527 the main lesson of recent elections seems to me to be that good data based arguments lose to better worded arguments and that push polling well executed slander and whisper campaigns are amazingly effective
4586528 liberal policies made america the freest wealthiest most successful and most powerful nation in human history conservatism in power always threatens to undo that national progress and is almost always frustrated by the innate decency and democratic instincts of the american people
4586529 if your workplace is safe if your children go to school rather than being forced into labor if you are paid a living wage including overtime if you enjoy a 40 hour week and you are allowed to join a union to protect your rights you can thank liberals if your food is not poisoned and your water is drinkable you can thank liberals if your parents are eligible for medicare and social security so they can grow old in dignity without bankrupting your family you can thank liberals if our rivers are getting cleaner and our air isnt black with pollution if our wilderness is protected and our countryside is still green you can thank liberals if people of all races can share the same public facilities if everyone has the right to vote if couples fall in love and marry regardless of race if we have finally begun to transcend a segregated society you can thank liberals progressive innovations like those and so many others were achieved by long difficult struggles against entrenched power what defined conservatism and conservatives was their opposition to every one of those advances
4586530 many democrats think that our patience and understanding are our weakness
4586531 here are some arguments that are being made that the democratic party has simply not responded to in the larger sense of the word response
4586532 transform the us into an organization that serves only american interests and to the hell with the rest of the world
4586533 if we view 1000 or even 10 000 dead soldiers as unacceptable we will never be able to fight a real war again proportional response with no preemption allows the other side to set the pace of the battle
4586534 throughout history governments have had a strong interest in promoting long term child rearing heterosexual relationships that is why governments create a legal definition of marriage and provide lots of benefits to heterosexual couples who enter into it this has been true for states throughout history independent of the religious beliefs of the populace worrying about changing that definition even to the point of deciding against a change is not automatically sexism or bigotry if you never are willing to draw a line where human life starts there will be no line
4586535 just because it says something in the bible doesnt mean there are no ancillary arguments supporting it
4586536 actually stuff thats lasted for thousands of years is more likely to be useful than stuff that was dreamed up in a french philosophy book
4586537 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
4586538 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4586545 music has always been an integral part of the canadian forces and the musical salute is one way that we can thank canadians for their continued support

4586552 there are shortages of workers in many professions and trades these broad consultations with stakeholders have provided us with a picture of the most common and acute pressures across the country and how immigration can play a role in addressing them
4586553 our government is committed to helping newcomers and their families succeed when they come to canada their success is our success
4586554 we cant prioritize occupations and professions in demand if there isnt the necessary support and training available to help newcomers begin work in their chosen fields
4586555 we need to ensure that canada continues to balance the needs of our canadian industries in terms of labour shortages and family reunification for our newcomers

4586650 mechanical animation and a less than stellar script make the clone wars a pale shadow of george lucas once great franchise
4586651 pretty much drives a stake into the heart of every loyal fan of the movies
4586652 clone wars is just the latest drop of anemic blood squeezed from the petrifying husk of a once innovative science fiction franchise
4586653 unlike its predecessors this one doesnt even try to aspire to myth it aspires only to merchandising

4586677 excuse me twelve hundred tanks came into georgia within few hours
4586678 there is no way you can mobilize those tanks in such a fast period unless you were ready
4586679 it will replicate in georgia and elsewhere in the future

4586681 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim

4586690 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4586691 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4586692 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
4586693 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends

4586696 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4586697 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist
4586698 should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy
4586699 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4586743 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4586796 u s conventional prompt global strike issues for 2008 and beyond
4586797 some conventional prompt global strike systems like some of the ground based concepts have gone out of their way to separate themselves from nuclear systems and we could open these to international inspections

4586802 in light of the appropriately extreme reluctance to use nuclear weapons conventional prompt global strike could be of particular value in some important scenarios

4586832 far from flourishing under potential scenarios of global warming the snakes are predicted to be seriously impacted by models of global climate change a fate which is likely not unique to the pythons
4586833 we are well beyond virtualization being a fad or a new craze
4586834 you need to respond to what is happening in the overall marketplace you are at a competitive disadvantage if your competitors have a more flexible and resilient virtual environment
4586835 for cost and profitability it is insane to be running all these servers when you can virtualize
4586836 new customers are an essential component to the long term growth and the sustainability of our business
4586837 the minute you stop looking for new customers youre dependent on existing customers that could become stagnant
4586838 and the importance of finding new customers went up considerably now its critical
4586839 the vendors love it these team members are the brightest and most competitive folks
4586840 so with advances in hardware and now software weve eliminated any technology hurdles
4586841 a boss once told me to focus more on connecting with people by sharing experiences with them ive found this to be very valuable with our channel partners who need to work with a vendor who understands their pain we must understand them before we can offer solutions
4586842 the best advice i received was from a professor in graduate school as i walked out the door what he said to me was as you go the corporate route and make your way to the top dont be the last to know what he meant by that was to always be in touch with your people and to always understand what is happening be a good communicator dont be the last to know what is going on dont surround yourself in a bubble so you dont know whats going on
4586843 hire people who are different from you and have the skills and talents that you do not in order to build a world class team this was told to me by gary creighton at bell atlantic when i became a first line manager
4586844 trust your gut this was from a terrific senior executive who acted as my career counselor and personal mentor for the bulk of my career at accenture i took this advice to heart midway through my career and it has not failed me yet in business and in life
4586845 be grateful every day live your values serve others and think big
4586846 the best advice i ever received came from my mother years ago when i was growing up she told me you can accomplish whatever you want to if you set your mind to it that advice has absolutely shaped who i am how i approach challenges and what i have accomplished to date i learned at an early age there is simply no limit to what you can accomplish if you want to do it badly enough and are willing to put in the investment to make it happen
4586847 enjoy what youre doing do it well and strike a balance
4586848 i had a manager once explain about people who thought they were indispensable we were in the middle of a software implementation he said that only if you could put your hands in a bucket of water and part the water were you indispensable i have always remembered that
4586849 the means never justify the end the means are everything from my late husband bill cage
4586850 the importance of getting broad experience to better position yourself for leadership roles in the future
4586851 my dad parker smith has given me great advice over the years one piece of advice most memorable to me is you can be who you want to be an accomplish most anything through persistence and hard work this statement has motivated me throughout my education and career
4586852 if you cant do your job in eight hours then you are either not working effectively or you have too much work and need to delegate most people who work 12 to 15 hour days waste a lot of time this advice came from my father who is a colonel in the u s army
4586853 if youre going to do something do it right the first time
4586854 you are what you thought about you become what you think about at my first job after college i attended a new employee orientation one of the executives said this statement and it has stuck with me ever since it is extremely important to visualize where you want to be personally professionally and spiritually in order to continue to grow and accomplish all of the things you have planned in life
4586855 enjoy what you do and be nice to people from my mother
4586856 i was encouraged by a colleague to read the book play like a man win like a woman what men know about success that women need to learn
4586857 the best and most unique channel advice i was ever given from ross brown was to stay maniacally focused on the customer if you get wrapped up in watching and reacting to what the competition is doing you arent taking your clues from the right source satisfied well serviced and educated customers equate to a strong long term business from loyal customers starting from the point of delighted and loyal customers and working back to a channel strategy has served me well in my 10 plus years working in the channel
4586858 move toward the pain it is the single most important thing i continue to learn and it came from my exploration of kabbalah
4586859 corporate commitment to continuous quality performance embracing professional principles for highest standard of ethical behavior and professional integrity and empowering employees entrepreneurial spirit for innovation in a backstage green room conversation with jack stack of src holdings corp at the washington d c event where we shared a presentation on keynote panel state of our economy securing our economic future the white house conference on the economy this conversation made a lasting impression on me as he truly exemplified the empowerment of each employees entrepreneurial spirit with his corporate model of human intellectual capital when employees think and act like owners developing success through a highly motivated and business savvy workforce
4586860 i believe the best advice i received was from my parents they always told me that i could accomplish anything the sky is the limit they told me never to quit always give everything i can to ensure success
4586861 the best career advice i received was from my mom
4586862 from jack thompson the former cio of mccormick spice company and a dear friend he told me to focus sounds simple and always not so easy to do
4586863 they were convinced of the long term business opportunity that existed for us in the credit union space they made it much easier for us to test and decide to move than we possibly could have without that help
4586864 i remember very well the money spent on n able
4586865 the migration took quite a bit of effort once you know a product now you have to learn a new one but our people have come through it and were pleased with where we are at today
4586866 weve discussed that since day one growth locally is a longer sales cycle and the potential here allowed us in the credit union space to be dramatically larger that makes it easier to fight through the challenges of changing technology
4586867 its the only thing that rivals vmware in terms of take up
4586868 server storage virtualization optimizes the number of storage arrays and dedupe is important in optimizing the number of disks
4586869 a year or longer ago people looked at it maybe for archiving
4586870 today if you look at the manufacturers a lot are coming out with dedupe for disk storage customers now expect it
4586871 now its definitely being requested by it in their quest to control costs
4586872 it is trying to leverage every trick to drive out costs now we dont have to say anything about dedupe
4586873 theres not a ton of awareness of what the options are
4586874 its not as hard a sell as say professional soccer in the u s but customers havent prioritized on dedupe yet but ive seen analyst reports and i expect a boom in the next five years
4586875 thats a classic example of how it has become a feature
4586876 give it a couple more years and it will be more so
4586877 emc netapp and others are attempting to cauterize data domains lead by saying that dedupe is a feature not a product
4586878 i let myself down i think i was more powerful i also think i scored more points
4586879 i have been ill for three days but our team doctors worked hard to allow me to start the match i want a medal so much
4586880 there is a high possibility that the beef box was included in the container as a result of a simple mistake during the shipment preparation process
4586881 the new words we added paint a vivid picture of current interests and concerns for example our increasing fondness for exotic food and drink
4586882 the show focuses on a young boy found wandering outside an ancient temple somewhere in china who dreams of becoming a kung fu master as with all stories things dont go exactly according to plan after being taken into the temple the young novice monk called chun yi the pure one has many temptations to overcome but through hard work and over time he conquers and finally reaches his sacred goal of enlightenment
4586883 i wanted to make it something that did not exist something young people can enjoy reading
4586884 it would be full of government jargon and very boring thats what i thought
4586885 we spent a lot of time on this because we wanted to make sure its truly green even the master cartons to the retailer are made of 100 percent recyclable cardboard
4586886 our superintendent told the staff that were going to get on this ship and its leaving the dock
4586887 a former school president with ties to at amp t managed to get a fibre connection to the school which has allowed the entire community to get high speed internet
4586888 he liked it bought a few and threw them out there
4586889 so now most of our elementary school classrooms have them and there are several in our middle school and high school
4586890 i personally think hes the best coach in the history of the league and we would be lucky if we can get him here that said hes not the coach of the galaxy cobi is thats the way it is as of today
4586891 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4586892 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4586893 with cavic and ian having a great semifinal its going to be a good race tomorrow im going to do everything i can to be a little bit closer in the first 50 and hopefully if im there at the 50 ill be there at the finish
4586894 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4586895 oh and also a pair of those nice board shorts for my friend here
4586896 from the first day this was an experience like no other
4586897 it was very clear avnet put themselves up 10 notches with this
4586898 we went to the medical records department to see how information is captured from there we went to the emergency department through it through the lab then through radiology
4586899 we spent a fair amount of time in the nursing department to see how they keep track of things around the patient
4586900 they got to dress up in scrubs they were watching actual surgeries to understand the technologies in that department
4586901 they got to see and talk to personnel live and they can go back to their territories now and have a good solid understanding of what the challenges are
4586902 you go into an environment to provide technology solutions but until you see it in action and the business problems they face every day its hard to connect the dots to see how the technology works
4586903 im very happy with the way it went i think the level of engagement of the participants was outstanding
4586904 one of the things i learned was they have a lot of jargon i learned a whole new dictionary
4586905 this was the best training ive ever received in my professional life but it was also an unbelievable experience in my personal life to understand what theyre going through
4586906 if i knew the difference i would have made the adjustment right away
4586907 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year where he was really dominating
4586908 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding the main thing was he could throw it for strikes early in the count
4586909 tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries particularly to those of asian nations
4586910 we have not forgotten for even a moment that the peace and prosperity of today was created because of the sacred sacrifices of those who lost their precious lives in the war
4586911 looking back on history i earnestly hope the horrors of war will not be repeated
4586912 together with the public i pay a heartfelt tribute to those who lost their lives on the battlefield and fell in the ravages of war and pray for world peace and further development of our country
4586913 the government should seriously consider establishing a memorial facility that is not based on a particular religion and one where everyone can unite and pay tribute
4586914 our nation and our neighboring countries still have unresolved issues related to history that have become a thorn and are causing friction
4586915 i have to know am i a geek or am i a nerd
4586916 the other day i got in a chat with a guy from the states who said i wasnt a geek i was a nerd in fact a five star nerd so we quarreled i surfed the net to find the proper language to argue my case expressions like drop dead dimwit and he would respond with spoken like a true nerd
4586917 i feel my identity threatened youre an english teacher so tell me am i a geek or am i a nerd
4586918 geek nerd weirdo i dont get it in japanese i am just otaku how come english splits things so many ways is it because in america one word wont cover it all americans are too strange
4586919 when the guy called you a nerd he just used the word he prefers he knows nothing of you and nothing of japan
4586920 in the end talk it out and seek a common understanding
4586921 then im a geek or maybe a maniac i like that too
4586922 this identity crisis has been traumatic to tell the truth its the real reason ive been absent so much
4586923 my heart is too full to talk im really happy
4586924 but not much time is left for me either i feel lonely since fewer families are attending
4586925 i will convey that we would like to strengthen cooperation on the investigations and if we can go into further detail during the discussions i would like to do so
4586926 the fact that china gave us information which is not necessarily consistent with what the chinese investigative authorities have been claiming until now shows chinas determination not to be spiteful
4586927 i dont think most people recognize thats what japans strength is i think japan has a potential to become a creative engine for the world
4586928 half of americans said something about japanese and 100 percent of chinese said something about japanese they were growing up thinking that japan is just cool
4586929 now take it and keep moving into adulthood with them and continue to give them amazing fashion and others
4586930 most western countries are very open to japan being a kind of design leader now japan has to get some confidence and take the lead on it
4586931 i think a lot of japanese people say things like oh no we just make minor little changes we are not really creative but out of a bunch of minor and little changes comes a product
4586932 one of the biggest impediments to the japanese economy being more global
4586933 my most important goal is to create a world class business school
4586934 what i want to see at some point is more western companies hiring japanese to be the head of their group
4586935 that would be a great goal maybe in my lifetime
4586936 people have different religious views so going to a shrine should be freely allowed
4586937 it is a fact that visiting yasukuni has caused problems
4586938 i feel we must keep demanding that the government do the right thing
4586939 my brothers plane was shot down over the pacific and his body was never found but i feel his soul is here in this shrine
4586940 but politicians who were scared off visiting and paying their respects to the shrine must not forget that the sacrifices of the dead are what helped build todays japan
4586941 well i dont know all the words to that song but ill say this were very excited just in the fact that we feel we improved off last weeks performance
4586942 it was first held in 1997 to stimulate the town
4586943 she still had her wedding kimono and let us use it when the town revived the ceremony for the first time
4586944 we decided to hold the event to erase the negative image of kitsunebi
4586945 we dont want politicians to visit yasukuni shrine we should not cooperate with u s led wars
4586946 i still clearly remember what he said when he left home its frustrating to go off to a war that we already know we are going to lose i dont think i will come home it was really tragic to see him go
4586947 he left home and one month later we learned that he had died im here for him and other people who lost their relatives we should raise our voices so this wont happen again
4586948 schools should put more emphasis on history education and invite us as guest speakers to pass on our experiences
4586949 i am one of those who experienced the war i know what the country did in china and other asian countries visiting yasukuni shrine is stupid
4586950 japan is one of the big donors of official development assistance through bilateral relationships japan with its war renouncing article 9 of the constitution can give advice and contribute to preventing wars while providing development assistance
4586951 but this is not my best merely enough for me to get to the finals
4586952 everything is good but in the final there will be great competition
4586953 i trained hard for a few years to participate in this event its a great feeling to be here
4586954 its difficult to get into the finals with only one throw
4586955 wedding ceremonies are traditionally funded by congratulatory money while there is little change
4586956 weddings are little affected by the state of the economy
4586957 during the bubble economy weddings became a couple oriented ceremony and now it is centered on the couple and the guests
4586958 couples want a wedding they and the guests can both enjoy
4586959 when i attended my friends wedding i found out that it wasnt fun at all
4586960 there wasnt any dramatic event and the wedding was all held in the same style
4586961 when i started the business the style of wedding from programs to invitation cards was nothing near what the bride and groom wanted
4586962 by starting my business i helped satisfy the demand that already existed
4586963 the measures they took were to build a new guesthouse style banquet create a brides room and make sure guests from different wedding parties do not meet in the facility
4586964 even if couples hold the ceremony with a smaller number of people the spending per guest is pretty high
4586965 organizers are shifting their business target more on to the amount of spending per guest than the number of couples they organize weddings for this trend is likely to continue in the coming decade or two
4586966 the government must store copies of the documents and we will demand that it make them open to the public by presenting the government with the duplicates of the released documents
4586967 the stubborn attitude of the government which does not respect historical facts is a betrayal of the public
4586968 it is our right as well as duty to urge the government to reveal the truth and hand it down to later generations
4586969 it is a state crime to submit a false treaty text to the diet covering up the secret pact for discussion and approval and it is an abuse of power to indict a reporter who tried to inform the public of the state crime
4586970 i think it is the best way to counter the government which has made no bones about telling lies over the secret pact as we cannot depend on the judiciary which has evaded making judgment on whether the secret agreement existed
4586971 i also expect our efforts will urge the government to review its reluctance to disclose diplomatic documents as tokyo is far behind other advanced nations in information disclosure
4586972 japan paid a total of 320 million to the united states in costs for okinawas reversion which included the 4 million
4586973 it is an appropriate attitude for a state which is supposed to be rational to rectify its deceptions and declare the truth but the japanese government has never taken such a stance
4586974 i hope our information disclosure request will urge the government to straighten itself out for the sake of its future
4586975 he can swim so many races in competition when you look at him he is the best so endurance is what makes him so big
4586976 its not a shame to be beaten by the best man
4586977 i had literally five minutes between the awards ceremony of the 200 im and switching to my race stuff putting my cap on and marching out
4586978 there was no time now ive got a lot of time to rest ive got 18 hours to get ready for tomorrow
4586979 anybody can say what they want i know for me im clean
4586980 i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can say what they want but the facts are the facts
4586981 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4586982 i spoke mostly portuguese at home to my kids but they are doing well in japanese
4586983 but i know many brazilian kids are having a hard time at school
4586984 children are able to communicate in japanese but have not reached the stage where they study subjects such as history and science in japanese thats largely because they spend time in language classes while other kids are pursuing those subjects
4586985 the system basically means japan is trying to send foreigners away in three years
4586986 disregard problems that will emerge by bringing in more foreigners
4586987 what about safety their education costs to take care of those issues the most serious problem is that our traditional culture will be threatened to the core
4586988 the idea of a society in which multiple ethnicities or cultures coexist is an empty theory such societies have seldom existed in history
4586989 however a couple weeks later his former employer went belly up so we got him
4586990 he went 18 months without a job one storage vendor i worked with who wanted to hire him called me about him and i told them if they hired him i would never buy products from them again they hired him and i cut our relationship
4586991 its not worth the effort around here you know who youre dealing with and do everything with a handshake a handshake down here is still a pretty good bond
4586992 when people leave we remind them of the contract they signed
4586993 when we first saw the house it was standing empty it remained empty for two years despite our monthly entreaties about its status then one day our agent told us it had been sold and was up for rent it must have been karma because that was also the time i was looking for studio space
4586994 we came back to japan in 2000 this time with a daughter also because tim had a year to year exchange at osaka university when that contract was up he found a job at sophia womens college in hadano where he teaches language acquisition
4586995 she was in crane pose and i couldnt believe how much strength and balance was required
4586996 that really shocked me all those big burly guys those athletes doing poses
4586997 it didnt hit me so hard in hagi because of the sense of community i had little to do but made friends had a social life when we moved to osaka though i felt far more isolated and as a result became very depressed
4586998 i learned what nearly every student of yoga learns you start a practice for one reason and then you realize how yoga benefits every part of your life now i teach hatha yoga which connects controlled movement with controlled breathing
4586999 ive always been interested in politics but id never heard of democrats abroad id come from a republican family even voted republican in the 1980 reagan carter election but then something very interesting happened
4587000 once i got out of my small town in delaware i began noticing the effects of some of those conservative policies that reagan supported such realizations made me question many of my beliefs
4587001 so many people living in the u s have come to believe the myths and lies theyve been fed by pundits and opponents of national health care that its socialized medicine that there is no choice or the quality of care is substandard well as americans living abroad we know the benefits of national health insurance
4587002 america is in a great position to benefit from the experiences of japan the u k france and even denmark and to choose what works in those systems and what doesnt
4587003 no no i hear people in the u s screaming
4587004 our taxes will be so much higher first of all thats wrong but even if taxes were higher it isnt a matter of how high taxes are but how theyre spent
4587005 we need that id rather have a true progressive but that would make the right blow a gasket
4587006 theres also the anxiety about whether hell be able to stand up against the forces that pounded al gore in 2000 and kerry in 2004
4587007 i believe that what i do here will help me affect changes in u s politics one day in the meantime thank goodness for yoga because it is what keeps me from exploding in anger and frustration at what is happening to my country
4587008 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4587009 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4587010 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4587011 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4587012 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4587013 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4587014 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4587015 i just have to do what i do best ill just try and be first in every race and ill be first in the final
4587016 if i ranked one place higher i would have been unable to qualify but i placed 13th im only one centimeter behind the 12th place guy
4587017 for me wearing a bikini is the best way to show my support and support for our sporting stars
4587018 well done ref the game ended 10 vs 9 but you did a great job
4587019 jalan ini ditargetkan sudah bisa dilalui pada tanggal 15 september nanti atau sekitar dua minggu menjelang hari raya idul fitri

4587030 we have certain players and natashas one of them that give us energy in the locker room and on the field
4587031 if a skirt or dress is short enough for you to have to wear leggings underneath it you dont need to wear it to school
4587032 just remember you cant change him and what you see is what youll get
4587033 why he came we want to go our own way be our own god
4587034 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4587035 we have to be careful in each word we write
4587036 if we write something that isnt in favour of the militants resistance groups the military or the government then we are in a dangerous situation
4587037 for being iraqis we are in a more delicate situation because we dont have anywhere to hide or anyone to support
4587038 sometimes we have to hide behind foreigners to be protected
4587039 nothing is being done to protect journalists covering the iraq situation
4587040 it is becoming intolerable especially when you see that the proposed democracy is just for politicians but not for other professionals or ordinary iraqis
4587041 in addition to being easy targets to survive we have to accept working as journalists but having our names hidden while foreigners take all the credit by using our stories under their by line
4587042 they dont offer any protection and even if we are killed our families dont have the right of insurance as they have
4587043 my son was killed for speaking with a journalist about us elections
4587044 they made him two questions and it was enough reason for them to kill him he wasnt aware of the new law imposed in our district and was a victim of the daily violence in iraq
4587045 a menu featuring donkey meat in a pot braised bullfrog hog hoof and turtle our pals went with the kung pao chicken

4587049 at the beginning i was really nervous because its a huge animal
4587050 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
4587051 we were very close to the animal actually we were touching it with the canoe when we struck at the beginning
4587052 theyre so proud of the hunters and for the community
4587053 we identified that there was a sufficient number of whales to allow three hunts in nunavut and nunavik
4587054 it was a very rapid hunt so it is very unlikely that the animal actually suffered
4587055 i still feel it im about to cry myself its not just for our community its for all of nunavik
4587056 a lot of people are amazed by seeing that animal
4587057 he was a small boy who was barely starting his life id rather it was me in his place because i have already lived longer
4587058 he was the smallest in the family of three sisters and two brothers but he helped us all
4587059 we dont want it to take centuries to get a response about the cause of brothers death which to us as a family appears clear
4587060 what i can say for the moment is if its necessary we will ask for it
4587061 we dont want any violence because of that violence my brother is dead
4587062 i have full confidence in them i think theyre professional theyre competent they have the experience and i think that they will continue to do what they have been doing for decades
4587063 i think that the security of the population is important and the police force has an important role to play to maintain that
4587064 its true that in the past if theres no criminal offence then the recommendations are not public
4587065 but as a result of discussions ive had quebec public security minister jacques dupuis said very clearly the recommendations and conclusions will be made public
4587066 i think if we really want to make a difference and improve the quality of life and ensure the security of citizens we have to do a little bit more
4587067 to see what can be done in certain districts of montreal
4587068 el cartel de soltera codiciada lo tengo todav a tengo muchas ganas de enamorarme a esta altura de mi vida quiero algo fuerte
4587069 vitor is out i spoke with him i think yesterday and he told me
4587070 actually it was on tuesday we had a conversation for about an hour or so and yeah i guess he broke his hand in two places is what he told me and he had been having 2 3 and 4 opinions on it he finally got the opinion that he wanted i guess and they told him to step out for a while
4587071 i dont confirm anything until i have all the papers signed
4587072 we are facing the much larger issue of how russia plans to behave in international affairs for decades to come
4587073 we are facing the much larger issue of how russia plans to behave in international affairs for decades to come

4587080 how can we not do our best to tackle these things
4587081 i think other countries might look at us as a third world country when it comes to what happens to so many americans faced with healthcare expenses they cannot afford
4587082 healthcare decisions need to be made by patients and their doctors not by insurance companies
4587083 healthcare professionals in growing numbers are supporting single payer health care where we use a system similar to medicare to pay bills and focus our efforts on improving the efficiency of care especially treatment of chronic diseases
4587084 instead of giving 20 percent of our health care dollars to insurance companies we need to spend 98 of our health care dollars on medical care we also need to allow the government to negotiate prices for prescriptions so u s consumers dont pay the highest prices in the world for medicine
4587085 congress spends 95 percent of its time on five percent of the issues
4587086 en el antiguo testamento ya dec a que la tierra era esf rica

4587091 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4587092 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4587093 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite

4587104 the ethiopian forces opened fire on the two civilian buses and they killed many i personally counted 15 just in one spot but i could not reach some of the other places where people are saying many others were killed

4587318 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4587319 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4587320 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
4587321 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4587322 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4587323 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4587324 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4587325 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4587326 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4587327 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4587328 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4587329 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4587330 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4587331 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4587332 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4587333 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4587334 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4587335 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4587336 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4587337 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4587338 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4587339 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4587340 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4587341 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4587342 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4587343 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4587344 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4587345 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4587346 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4587347 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4587348 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4587349 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4587350 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4587351 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
4587352 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
4587353 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4587354 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4587355 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4587356 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4587357 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4587358 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4587359 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4587360 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4587361 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4587362 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4587363 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4587364 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4587365 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4587366 the selection of politicians according to their intrinsic motivation to serve the public
4587367 for the moment take it on trust that i have drawn the poverty lines defensibly
4587368 governments in the countries of the bottom billion need to develop strategies appropriate to their circumstances
4587369 workers in developing countries get jobs and increased wages and the firms that move capital to developing countries get higher returns on it
4587370 who are none too sensitive when it comes to matters of governance
4587371 we have to face up to the fact that competing with china and india is going to be difficult
4587372 therefore goods and services exported from the bottom billion to the rich world markets should pay lower tariffs than the same goods coming from asia
4587373 you personally may be well informed about trade but if so you are in a minority in general rich country electorates are deeply misinformed
4587374 importance of strategic rather than unconditional integration with the global economy
4587375 nigerias best phase of economic policy was the reform phase of the late 1980s but the benefits of these reforms were completely swamped by the coincident crash in the world price of oil
4587376 five billion people who are already prosperous or at least are on track to be so
4587377 a mong the many characteristics that do not seem to matter one way or the other are democracy and political rights
4587378 induce an excessively large public sector with too many white elephant projects
4587379 the only forum for doing this at present is the g8
4587380 the same rules apply to domestic investors as foreign investors
4587381 somehow the colonial fantasy persists that we have hard power we dont and we never will
4587382 a barbarous genocide of innocent people apparently with complete peace of conscience east timor is being wiped out by an invasion a brutal conquest that produces heaps of dead maimed and orphaned
4587383 wars of aggression harsh and brutal practices during decades long military occupations and grave breaches of the geneva convention
4587384 develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples
4587385 we declared war on america and britain out of our sincere desire to ensure japans self preservation and the stabilization of east asia it being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement
4587386 where the state has failed and a hobbesian war of all against all is underway
4587387 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
4587388 killed unknown numbers of poor people in the bombarded slums thousands according to the victims
4587389 spread of democracy is an explicit agenda indeed even the overarching agenda of the united states in the middle east
4587390 dissuading potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equalling the power of the united states
4587391 ensuring uninhibited access to key markets energy supplies and strategic resources
4587392 was the culmination of a 110 year period during which americans overthrew fourteen governments that displeased them for various ideological political and economic reasons
4587393 better for half a million rwandans to have died than for eighteen americans to be sacrificed
4587394 you simply cant trust the rebel discourse of concern for social justice
4587395 clean drinking water electricity environmental reparations employment and scholarships for young people
4587396 grand strategy that begins with a fundamental commitment to maintaining a unipolar world in which the united states has no peer or competitor
4587397 stupendous source of strategic power and one of the greatest material prizes in world history
4587398 vital prize for any power interested in world influence or domination
4587399 it is commonplace that the rich world wants to shift its dependence on oil away from the middle east
4587400 create a transparent and investor friendly environment for resource prospecting
4587401 the area of landlocked low income countries currently classified as resource scarce is enormous it seems likely that there are valuable resources in the ground that have not yet been discovered
4587402 we drew upon the data of an american political scientist who has assiduously trawled through thousands of pages of newspaper reports to produce a comprehensive list of all the reported coup plots failed coup attempts and successful coups in africa
4587403 political scientists have classified the different gradations of democracy across the globe and over time and we used this standard classification
4587404 political scientists have developed a quantitative measure of political restraints on power
4587405 i remember when one of the worlds great experts on banking consulted me because he had been asked to advise one of the countries of the bottom billion he was struggling to come up with evidence that banking reform would directly help the poorest people in the country because he sensed that without such evidence his advice would be dismissed the much stronger evidence that it would help the growth process would not be valued he felt
4587406 one of his aides took me aside after the meeting and told me the truth

4587418 americas neoimperial grand strategy threatens to rend the fabric of the international community and political partnerships precisely at a time when that community and those partnerships are urgently needed it is an approach fraught with peril and likely to fail it is not only politically unsustainable but diplomatically harmful and if history is a guide it will trigger antagonism and resistance that will leave america in a more hostile and divided world

4587423 we support georgias sovereignty we support its independence we support its territorial integrity we support its democracy and its democratically elected government
4587424 never ever will georgia reconcile with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory
4587425 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4587428 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4587429 of an inspiring and hopeful new chapter in europes history
4587430 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
4587431 the opposite is true free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
4587432 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interests
4587433 a lot of them will go to great lengths to avoid us

4587459 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more

4587466 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
4587467 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
4587468 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
4587469 we run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses and those producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures
4587470 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4587471 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4587472 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4587473 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4587474 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally

4587481 california curriculum commission recommends six ground breaking reading programs from pearson for states students

4587487 we must all work together to improve student performance this is critical to the futures of the children in our state and our entire pearson team is 100 committed to californias teachers parents and students to make that happen

4587496 if things go according to plan in the race ill take the suffering afterwards
4587497 the whole thing has just been the hardest thing that ive ever done coming through this
4587498 running outside is what i love doing its much easier to do that than it is to do the huge amounts of cross training looking at walls and not even being outside so certainly when it gets really tough in that race im going to be thinking about walls stuck in front of my face and thats going to be pushing me on
4587499 there were a lot of things going wrong and i almost felt like i was being tested to see if i wanted to be here strongly enough
4587500 one of the largest public works efforts in the world
4587501 the projects include coastal restoration efforts that will provide the coastal buffer we need to improve our hurricane protection levees already under construction and funds to advance hurricane protection efforts in every coastal parish in our state
4587502 we have always said that in order to keep louisiana safe we need both to strengthen the levees we have now and restore the wetlands and coastal areas that serve as our natural hurricane barriers
4587503 this is financially prudent in that future surpluses are uncertain and will allow the state to help keep the corps on schedule and continuing coastal development projects
4587504 this plan shows a substantial commitment to projects that will allow us to restore wetlands by using sediment that would otherwise have gone to waste
4587505 these projects will restore the mississippi rivers capacity to build land and allow us to take advantage of storm protection provided by our natural resources
4587506 the barrier islands act as a speed bump for storm surge and wave energy
4587507 louisiana loses the equivalent of 32 football fields worth of wetlands every day and that includes many of our barrier islands this leaves coastal communities vulnerable to the full wrath of hurricanes the new funding will help us rebuild those speed bumps and bring back our first line of defense against storms
4587508 it is time to start breaking ground and digging dirt on these projects
4587509 make a robust investment in science and technology to provide solutions to our coastal restoration and protection challenges

4587516 a petrobras tem que ser fortalecida n o enfraquecida qualquer medida para diminuir o escopo da petrobras deve ser repensado com cautela

4587524 yeah i catch the dart at least once a week and ride down to a nursing home on mlk where i visit folks who dont have anyone else visiting them
4587525 no its not ive been doing this for years now

4587528 through photosynthesis algae reproduce during the day in the sun
4587529 when the sun sets the algae look for other sources of oxygen it pulls the dissolved oxygen from the water in the lake the result is a conflict between the algae and the fish
4587530 the park is closed for fishing but is open for everything else the dead fish are being moved
4587531 it was very encouraging that my work in music was being regarded not just in my playing but also in my depth of knowledge of my instruments
4587532 a sense of power when i am playing and makes me feeling that i can express whatever it is thats inside me
4587533 i can use piano as a medium to give out vibes of what i am feeling
4587534 but theres a rush when im playing when ive finished and know i did well its like euphoria i feel ive achieved something
4587535 for me the most influential piece of art is music
4587536 its given me the inspiration to achieve what i want id love to be a concert pianist and to perform with world renowned orchestras and give concerts
4587537 it takes courage to live in a world that tries to force you into a box
4587538 one person read a note from judy shepard the mother of matthew shepard who was killed near laramie wyo in 1998 because he was gay
4587539 she always knew she was supposed to be a girl and we knew it too
4587540 dont remember her as transgendered but remember her as a beautiful loving woman
4587541 you are who you are and you should never be ashamed
4587542 for their sake for the sake of shattered families and grieving friends and for the sake of all that is decent and moral in civil society we can finally hear their stories honor their lives and take steps to stop the hate and violence
4587543 is the most important one of which i am aware seeking to illuminate the lives and struggles faced by gender variant and transgender people in the united states
4587544 a gay rights issue because it makes a poster child out of my son
4587545 her role as a junior high principal asserting her beliefs for gay rights
4587546 it does send out a ripple effect and lets everyone know how vulnerable they are
4587547 it doesnt matter who the victim is or whether the victim is victimized because they are a certain race religion sexual orientation its a crime and in weld county in greeley were going to do the best we can to enforce the law it murder cant be tolerated at any level
4587548 i hope that if anything positive were to come of this we would develop a stronger relationship with the gay and lesbian transgender community so that they understand just how seriously we take crimes like this and how vigorously we will pursue justice in a situation like this we are not tolerant of people who would do harm to the residents of our town
4587549 there is little in setoodehs article to suggest that king was not fully to blame for his own death
4587550 the reason larry died isnt as clear cut as many people think
4587551 a troubled child who flaunted his sexuality and wielded it like a weapon

4587578 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4587579 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
4587580 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
4587581 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4587582 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4587583 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
4587584 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again
4587585 i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit
4587586 i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4587587 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
4587588 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4587589 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4587590 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything
4587591 the first time he gets me in a boat and gets me out about 50 feet and says all right were fishing for paychecks today im swimming back if i drown you guys will know what happened
4587592 this is another example of a life saved rather than abandoned
4587593 they will never collect so much as 35 from mike nifong
4587594 it is better to fight the iraqi army today than they fights tomorrow
4587595 perhaps more worrying finding is the lack of imaginative direction that teacher were giving in use of the internet per se in the focus schools
4587596 you know mike mckenzie and kenny chesney are from the opposite ends of the earth and yet here they are that one afternoon and kenny notices mikes wearing the same clothes hes been in all day from his rehab and id love to see this but chesneys undressing mckenzie

4587632 when i first came up with the title it was from a place of pure frustration it seemed a futile thing to do you make a record and really whats the point its like milking a bee
4587633 id say mine were better but my parents had a 21 year head start so were about even
4587634 everyone knows bombon and andrade jewelers are gone but no one thinks we were burned out because the front of the store looks okay
4587635 the fire came into our kitchen from the back its pretty scorched plus we lost all the food the walk in cooler isnt working and all the walls have water damage
4587636 this was my baby it took 10 months to create but just one day to destroy

4587641 looking only at the statutory language one might well think that authorization alone could well be infringement
4587642 u se of the phrase to authorize is intended to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory infringers
4587643 the use of kazaa to share child pornography is sufficient to uphold a conviction for the knowing distribution of child pornography
4587644 e ven if the courts were correct in inferring an intent on the part of the congress that enacted the 1976 copyright act to equate all publications with distributions for purposes of 106 3 such an intent cannot override the plain meaning of the statutory text absent ambiguity or patent absurdity

4587651 wasnt filming jakes how to it was raising the money
4587652 we walked up to anyone who we ever knew or would know and humiliated ourselves
4587653 after a while we had to choose between waiting to raise more money or just shooting it i had no idea what i was getting into or whether i wanted to do this with my life i was eager to start shooting to find out if this is what i want to do with my life

4587656 are the biggest single countries that provide a challenge to the u s
4587657 i would say they are closely matched in terms of capability and programming to be able to induce an attack against the u s through the internet
4587658 this has been a very very powerful insight and we are learning who the botnets are and who are being told to attack and where those servers are and who is behind it
4587659 i think because we have more people who are able to utilize more equipment more operations more connectivity we are less vulnerable to this kind of attack but we are not immune
4587660 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion
4587661 the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4587662 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
4587663 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability

4587670 theres no way that harry potter was worried about twilight but twilight has got to be feeling very good right now

4587672 russia has learned the lessons taught by nato in yugoslavia immediately initiating a bombing campaign against georgias air bases and other military facilities
4587673 the failure to quickly suppress the georgian air defense despite rather rudimentary capabilities or to achieve air supremacy despite a lack of fighter planes in the georgian air force shows the poor condition of the russian air force
4587674 one general lesson that the russian side should learn is that it is possible to build a capable well trained force in just three to four years as saakashvili did
4587675 the main lesson that russia should draw from this conflict is that we need to urgently upgrade our air force with a comprehensive general reform to follow
4587676 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
4587677 theres an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the judiciary committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing

4587679 the photograph is offensive to people of asian and chinese descent it was a poor decision for these professional athletes to make this historically denigrating gesture and it was a poorer decision for the team sponsor and the spanish paper to put it in print
4587680 and it is disturbing that neither the olympic athletes nor their sponsors have adequately apologized for their decisions
4587681 something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4587682 most of our community is still undecided and we have a great opportunity to win votes and affect the outcome of this election

4587690 that has become possible thanks to increasing the number of short and medium wave transmitters
4587691 voice of russia broadcasts in tbilisi on the fm frequency were stopped from late on 8 august
4587692 however voice of russia has retained its presence in georgias information space at the moment moscow broadcasts its programmes to the georgian territory and nearby areas for 14 hours a day
4587693 throughout the military conflict in south ossetia voice of russia was the only russian media outlet to inform georgian citizens of russias position on all the issues in the georgian ossetian conflict in a timely fashion
4587694 the voice of russia has opened a south ossetia mobile sms channel

4587697 ele come ou a adaptar aquele tra o de mang pr prio do jap o misturando com walt disney se voc for ver tem at uma pequena semelhan a entre os personagens de poca
4587698 seria um g nero mais adulto com hist rias do cotidiano ou at uma hist ria real por exemplo a hist ria de musashi que contada por um mang tem um tra o mais realista
4587699 principalmente porque as hist rias apesar delas terem uns temas meio fant sticos os personagens tem crises muito pr ximas s nossas o que torna eles mais humanos diferentes de um personagem de comics ou de uma hq por exemplo voc n o v o super homem pensando poxa vida meu deus ela me deu uma bota que chato voc v ele pensando nossa tem uma criptonita na cintura dele eu vou morrer ou voc pega bob esponja ele nunca vai se confrontar com a puberdade dele
4587700 p ra crian a de 9 a 11 anos mais ou menos voc pode resumir que em passa tempo dessa faixa em diante dos 12 aos 17 uma mistura de hobby com se expressar com eu quero impressionar algu m dezoito at os 29 30 anos acaba se tornando um meio de profiss o porque a pessoa a partir dos 18 anos j n o tem muito tempo pra ficar brincando na vida ela come a a assumir certas responsabilidades e desenho acaba sendo o investimento que a pessoa est fazendo
4587701 eu sempre falo isso para os meus alunos voc quer trabalhar com isso se dedica voc pode ter at o foco em mang mas procura ser um artista mais amplo porque se um dia voc entrar num est dio que trabalha por exemplo com publicidade ah hoje a gente vai fazer uma propaganda em mang voc viu que legal a a pessoa pensa nossa sei desenhar mang legal eu vou trabalhar com isso mas depois o cara vira e fala ent o a gente vai fazer uma propaganda em flash putz eu n o seu mexer em computador ah a gente vai fazer uma ilustra o pra uma revista s que tem que ser uma pintura em aquarela eu n o sei mexer com aquarela a gente vai fazer um desenho realista e vai enviar pro faust o mas eu n o sei fazer realista ent o s o essas coisas que o mercado vai come ando a te cobrar e voc vai vendo que voc ao inv s de ganhar por ser especialista numa rea s est perdendo melhor voc ser bom em v rias reas do que ser realmente muito bom numa s pra n o perder p blico

4587706 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4587707 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4587708 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog

4587729 the only good aspect of the abc memo is that it highlighted the issue and everybody is talking again about format rights and protection

4587757 i think the term digital divide sometimes is dangerous in the sense that it suggests that the minute a new and innovative technology is introduced in the market there is a divide unless it is equitably distributed among every part of the society and that is just an unreal understanding of an american capitalistic system i think there is a mercedes divide i would like to have one but i cant afford one im not meaning to be completely flip about this i think its an important social issue but it shouldnt be used to justify the notion of essentially the socialization of deployment of the infrastructure

4587784 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4587785 baa gatwick is disappointed to learn that the trade unions representing some swissport employees have voted for strike action later this month
4587786 baa gatwick is working closely with the handling agent and the airlines it represents to minimise the potential impact on passengers planning to travel on the proposed strike dates
4587787 a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4587788 gmb members cannot afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4587789 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises

4587816 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4587817 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4587818 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings

4587833 its a social thing all their buddies are on it
4587834 i couldnt do this on every community it was just a tremendous amount of effort
4587835 i have to credit the neighbors with going in with specific design changes over and over
4587836 the concept was when you stood on church road you dont want to see garages
4587837 we designed the exteriors and then worked on the interiors
4587838 but instead of downsizing we expanded we quickly figured out that we had to add onto the house so that our children and grandchildren would have enough room when they came to visit
4587839 we did not try to copy the feeling of the original structure
4587840 the transition area continued the feeling of the original house and then once you get through it you get into a space surrounded by light and trees
4587841 neighbors and real estate agents will draw and define their own boundaries

4587848 right now we have a full plate of those type of cases
4587849 i said to my husband this house is about to go into foreclosure

4587852 were now providing housing commensurate with the quality of their service
4587853 the guy i bought my house from didnt know he was in the historic district
4587854 im not against the historic district its just how the county is managing this
4587855 theres obviously a problem with this district because were having so much debate about it
4587856 i think its time for loudoun county to say we didnt do this one right
4587857 im concerned about opening up a pandoras box on all of the historic districts if we go about them in a piecemeal fashion
4587858 theres no one place to go to see how they work

4587863 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know that it has a good chance of meeting the designation criteria
4587864 the sense i get is that most people are not contesting that
4587865 they agree its a wonderful suburb what they are contesting is whether its something they want to deal with in their daily lives and that is an issue for us
4587866 i am so happy to be out of the suburbs

4587874 we had a dirt road i never locked my doors we spent our summers down at the beach my husband when he was alive wouldnt have lived anywhere else
4587875 he called the realtor and said we wanted to put a contract on it
4587876 we put a new driveway in and it didnt have a porch it had some siding on it its a money pit
4587877 youd be silly to have anything smaller to go out in the chesapeake
4587878 we loved our neighborhood but we couldnt go out at night

4587880 the epa is abandoning its mission by rushing a permit out the door for political expedience and ignoring the fact that it will emit massive quantities co2 and other pollutants
4587881 this permit is another example of the rush by the agencys political appointees to hand out gifts to industry before president bush leaves office
4587882 it ignores how emissions from desert rock will threaten air quality and endanger the health of people who live in the four corners region

4587892 it plays very well in the mobile marketplace it plays in emerging markets it plays into peoples desire to have a second pc or one for the kids thats low cost yet still capable
4587893 well know kind of in six months how much of this demand is real and how much is customers thinking theyre going to win in the marketplace and double ordering
4587894 it seems to be growing the market rather than cannibalizing existing pc sales
4587895 of course im still comfortable with it its still my forecast
4587896 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4587897 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
4587898 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible

4587958 there is ample reason to suspect that menthol may be harmful to many smokers and disproportionately harmful to black americans

4587961 the senate should follow the houses lead and give the fda regulatory control over tobacco

4587993 the taliban do not simply fail to value education they deliberately target it
4587994 do not simply fail to value education they deliberately target it
4587995 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their fellow citizens to control their own destiny
4587996 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4587997 one of the most dangerous and volatile countries for aid workers
4587998 when the lines are blurred between military operations and the provision of humanitarian aid aid workers lives are jeopardized

4588008 i dont think there is a lot of worse news that could happen

4588010 you might go to the supermarket and say to somebody what sort of potatoes are these and theyll say dirty ones out of the garden whereas id like to think that we might give you a more sincere and satisfactory answer
4588011 im not saying we go home and watch dvds about vegetables all night but weve got a little bit more of a speciality than a supermarket
4588012 the problem for retailers is such a high proportion of our costs are fixed you still have to pay your rent and youve still got to have people to open doors at the store
4588013 i agree with what has been stated in the question

4588018 the competition will be strong due to booming film production in the region
4588019 weve seen the success of bosnian and romanian films on the world stage in recent years and now its happening with turkish cinematography
4588020 because this type of attack requires the browser to interact with the already local activex plug in there are basically two ways to eliminate these kinds of issues one fix the vulnerable plug in or two tell the browser to stop talking to it the kill bit does the latter
4588021 microsoft seems to be stepping up to the plate by issuing kill bits for third party applications largely because ie is involved
4588022 after some investigations we found out that symantec especially included image uploader to the threat list in one of their updates
4588023 and perhaps unlike kill bit norton affects the new secure version
4588024 microsoft repeatedly and emphatically said that they are working to better secure the and everything which runs on it
4588025 while we wait for the cure the biomarkers the blood and saliva tests we will use the early detection imaging and diagnostic tool we have available right now the 64 slice low dose ct scan the first of a dozen nationwide early detection for lung cancer programs funded by this foundation has launched at sequoia hospital in redwood city california lets find lung cancer before it finds you
4588026 today the gauntlet has been thrown down and lung cancer will no longer wallow in obscurity underfunding and beneath the burden of abysmal survival i applaud and deeply thank senators chuck hagel and dianne feinstein for their vision courage and pioneering spirit to bring the lung cancer epidemic to the public debate and as a priority for health care research and funding for much too long lung cancer patients have suffered and died as a result of inadequate research and treatment options due to the stigma associated with smoking related diseases this bill literally changes everything it is time that the senate and congress realize that nearly 75 million of their constituents are at risk for this disease and that their timely passage of this initiative will be the wake up call to the nation for lung cancer to get the proportionate funding and attention that it rightly deserves and desperately needs this is great i love senators hagel and feinstein
4588027 i was in touch with senator hagels office last week from a distance at the 9th international lung cancer congress in hawaii when i first learned about this act i cant thank senators hagel and feinstein enough for continuing to make lung cancer a national priority it is obviously a priority to me an accidental lung cancer survivor and my family and every person involved with my foundation with over 450 people dying of lung cancer a day in the u s alone i personally dont understand why this is not already a national priority i thank both senators for bringing this to the forefront and i look forward to seeing this act enacted its long overdue by about four decades i am so grateful to the scientists and researchers and physicians and doctors who have made such strides in the survival rates for breast cancer 89 9 prostate cancer 99 9 and ovarian cancer 64 8 since the national cancer act in 1971 kudos to all of you the overall survival rate for lung cancer has remained the same 15 5 that needs to change thank you senators thank you lung cancer alliance thank you in advance to the members of the senate and eventually the house who will pass this we look forward to working very closely with you and accelerating the cure for lung cancer
4588028 i applaud senators hagel and feinstein for their sage wisdom and compassionate actions each of them has shown steadfast and unwavering support to eradicate a disease that is so lethal and widespread that it has almost become part of our global landscape unacceptable but tolerated no more i personally thank them for their refusal to remain complacent for their vision sticktoitiveness and for raising their powerful voices to refuse to allow lung cancer to remain an inconvenient fact an inconvenient truth i am deeply grateful to these visionary leaders
4588029 the federal government should implement a comprehensive policy to help reduce the mortality rate of lung cancer which accounts for 28 of all cancer deaths in men and women in the united states we have seen great advancements in prostate and breast cancer survival rates and we must commit ourselves to making the same progress with lung cancer we must bring people together and have the resources to fight this insidious disease
4588030 lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women but efforts to fund research and innovative new drug therapies have been shortchanged when compared to other cancers this bill would boost funding and expand research into the causes and treatment of this deadly scourge its time for the federal government to step up its efforts and make fighting lung cancer a national priority
4588031 if money for research and development was not a barrier and a true collaboration of academic medicine entrepreneurial biotech and pharmaceutical companies could be achieved what would be the immediate next steps needed to reach a cure in the least amount of time and how much would it cost

4588124 we set out to have a good start and just make sure we got up on everybody as fast as possible
4588125 we knew we had to get out early and get out of trouble
4588126 saying john mccain cost ohio jobs oh its just not true its obamas taxes that will hurt ohio families
4588127 i have heard about gas prices the farm bill jobs and education so far and indian issues
4588128 the overriding issue and it has started to hopefully look a little better has been the economy
4588129 promote healthcare reform as the top domestic priority for the next president and congress
4588130 ja ser ut som ett helvete menmen kom in du
4588131 the thing is the people who will plan our opening ceremony are part of that world we didnt go round the office and point at someone and say right youre doing the opening ceremony the people we have do this for a living theyre the very best around at arranging pop concerts and directing west end shows and theyre british they looked at that and thought thats really good but we can do something as good set in a different context they were more pumped up because it was so good i think they were quite excited by the challenge
4588132 this is amazing its fantastic its clearly been choreographed to within an inch of its life
4588133 but my judgment is youll not see another games like this again it wont continue to go in this direction it wont at london and it wont at chicago or wherever is next its just the scale of it which i think to try and match would run counter to our neighbours
4588134 i do remember coming to beijing for the first time after wed won our bid and i met the mayor and the look of incredulity on his face when i explained i was now into my 20th hour in front of a planning inquiry in stratford was a picture
4588135 he was fascinated that anyone could turn up and say you cant build the velodrome there its where my allotment is sure there are fewer constraints here but that doesnt make the games impossible to deliver in a democracy
4588136 i dont want to hear the excuse for us not delivering oh well thats china
4588137 because 85 per cent of what we have to do is the same as here we have to put the same olympic transport network in place for example sure that will be a challenge on piccadilly and commercial road but it has to be done the extra 15 per cent is about bringing our creativity to bear in a way that is not counter cultural to the people that matter
4588138 of course it will be in london but it is important the whole of the uk shares in it in china thats a massive challenge because its so huge in america you wouldnt have felt involved in atlanta actually if you were in atlanta you probably werent too aware of what was going on in atlanta but we can use our geographical advantage to get an emotional connectivity with our games across the country that will be our goal its about how we can be creative with live sites in city centres the german world cup fanzone idea there are lots of things i think we can do which are quite instinctive to us anyway what does the world know about us were actually quite good at partying lets turn it into a giant party
4588139 good example green issues weve widened the rivers running through the olympic park which means we can move 300 tonne barges in with building materials in the course of four years we can substitute something like 400 000 lorry journeys that way 90 per cent of the material we are using is recycled weve got one of the worlds largest soil washing machines 20 years ago that debris would have gone into landfill thats what we can do
4588140 it is about creativity coming to london is not just going to be a sporting experience its the whole the cultural whole sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is we can bring a massive level of creativity and britishness in the very best sense of the word and fun lets have a bit of fun with this
4588141 far from being intimidated by all this watching here i really am more excited about 2012 than ever
4588142 i just think its going to be the most amazing thing
4588143 thus the two superior court decisions issued on july 7 2006 and february 15 2008 will be given preclusive effect by this court
4588144 i went to maverick last night because it was on the heirloom tomato list only two dishes on the menu featured tomatoes the first sounded like a standard and the second was a bland whole wheat pasta with chopped tomatoes definitely could have made something more flavorful at home i agree with the other commenter and was disappointed
4588145 in this talk we go over weaknesses in common subway fare collection systems we focus on the boston t subway and we present several attacks to completely break the charlie card
4588146 if what the mit undergrads claim in their public announcements is true public disclosure of the security flaws before the mbta and its system vendors have an opportunity to correct the flaws will cause significant damage to the mbtas transit system
4588147 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4588148 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4588149 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are

4588156 mara was in japan training in the same conditions as osaka
4588157 when the leaders made a break at around 16km i pulled them back too quickly i took the lead at halfway rather as mara did in osaka then like her when the race took off again at 25km i started to die
4588158 maras best strategy is to tuck in at the back of the lead pack and save her strength until the race starts to unwind
4588159 well i dont know all the words to that song but ill say this were very excited just in the fact that we feel we improved off last weeks performance
4588160 it almost wasnt really a surprise because you see him do it in practice and he came out and had such a command over the offense its a good feeling
4588161 as comfortable as you can feel with two days of practice i think some good things happened though
4588162 he sat there and just smiled and we laughed about it but those things happen
4588163 i think it was a nice start for him well see where it goes

4588183 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4588184 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4588185 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4588186 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4588187 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4588188 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4588189 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4588190 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4588191 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4588192 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4588193 well they should they shouldve used it last year too because thats exactly what it was
4588194 weve got a young team this year but herms bringing them together were going to have a great year
4588195 6 8 wins and a 3rd place finish in the west a 2nd place finish and 9 wins would be a huge step forward for this team
4588196 and were not too far from that the biggest obstacle we have to get over is believing in ourselves and realizing we are a good football team
4588197 i really do i mean you talk about a tough guy he has the ability to lead i see it and the players see it he just needs to get a chance
4588198 and chan has brought that system here where he will have the function in it and play well
4588199 in 1972 the miami dolphins had the perfect season but they did not play one perfect game you win games a lot of ways the bottom line is to win

4588236 as he left for a visit to his outlying districts the jealous baron warned his pretty wife do no leave the castle while i am gone or i will punish you severely when i return but as the hours passed the young baroness grew lonely and despite her husbands warning decided to visit her lover who lived in the countryside nearby the castle was located on an island in a wide fast flowing river with a drawbridge linking the island and the land at the narrowest point in the river surely my husband will not return before dawn she thought and she ordered her servants to lower the drawbridge and leave it down until she returned after spending several pleasant hours with her lover the baroness returned to the drawbridge only to find it blocked by a madman wildly waving a long cruel knife do no attempt to cross this bridge baroness or i will kill you he raved fearing for her life the baroness returned to her lover and asked him to help our relationship is only a romantic one he said i will not help the baroness then sought out a boatman on the river explained her plight to him and asked him to take her across the river in his boat i will do it but only if you can pay my fee of five marks but i have no monley with me the baroness protested that is too bad no money no ride the boatman said flatly her fears growing the baroness ran crying to the home of a friend and after again explaining the situation she begged for enough money to pay the boatman his fee if you had not disobeyed your husband this would not have happened the friend said i will give you no money with dawn approaching and her last resource exhausted the baroness returned to the bridge in desperation attempted to cross to the castle and was slain by the madman

4588320 we gave it a lot of opportunities to find its way back but when he hit arbutus thats just a tough place
4588321 but as has been the case with this bear he simply made another wrong turn
4588322 worst case scenario you have the bear struck on an eight lane highway injured and in close proximity to humans
4588323 thats just a situation likely to end with a bad outcome
4588324 that bears been through a real ordeal the last few weeks wed hate for people to get out and look to bother it
4588325 gold is likely to regain 1 000 oz by end 2008 and to work higher through 2009 2010
4588326 longer term we believe that gold is capable of doubling or tripling from current levels
4588327 we remain positive on gold based on macro and supply demand factors the forces that have propelled gold for 5 years are firmly in place
4588328 following a series of downside fundamental tests gold appears to have found a floor and quietly climbed back to 917 oz
4588329 despite extensive hand wringing the floor in the dollar has inflicted minimal damage
4588330 we believe the drivers of the gold bull market remain intact heading into a favorable period
4588331 we see gold as well positioned heading into autumn when fabrication tends to heighten the market
4588332 should inflation accelerate while interest rates are locked under economic weakness gold could spike near past inflation adjusted highs
4588333 we view this as an extremely hospitable macro environment and believe the ongoing investment driven demand phase will continue for gold particularly as the broader investor base is not yet fully involved
4588334 gold is coming into its own with discourse dominated by credit crisis derivatives dislocations currencies inflation and self reinforcing financial negatives we believe gold is entering friendly macroeconomic territory
4588335 investment dominates demand with western macro driven investment demand taking prices higher and eastern jewelry fabrication filling in during periodic pullbacks
4588336 we believe gold has entered a new investment driven phase amid a much more hospitable macro environment while gold prices have been rising since 2002 this was largely due to the pull from pro cyclical basic materials and oil in a benign if unbalanced macro environment
4588337 we remain positive on gold based on a mix of macro and supply demand drivers the forces that have propelled gold for the past five years are in place and intensifying
4588338 appreciation remains muted relative to other metals and oil with prices barely regaining long term constant dollar averages corrections are expected along the way and buying on weakness is recommended which seems to be the central lesson of the past five years
4588339 within the pulse of investment demand catalysts for the gold market rally have shifted from safe haven demand during the early stages of the credit crisis in august september 2007 to currencies as the us dollar plummeted to the broader reflation trade on display in oil coordinated fed and central bank action to thaw credit markets and boost liquidity should be positive for hard assets and gold
4588340 with equity and fixed income markets facing stiff headwinds we expect weightings toward gold to increase especially as it has been rising in multiple currencies
4588341 this could be amplified by petro dollar flows and sovereign investment funds we continue to see gold as a small market with motivated buyers india china russia petro players and few sellers of size
4588342 the key variables will be the extent to which jewelry demand slips and the amount of new scrap becomes available
4588343 the last major price push was the 2006 gain 36 that cut jewelry demand by 16 and inspired 25 more scrap supply we believe a similar pattern is likely in 2008 although more muted due to dollar depreciation and less available scrap
4588344 we believe the likelihood of imf sales are low we regard central bank sales as a normal recurring feature of the gold market that has faded from relevance as a price determinant
4588345 never before has a country risen as fast as china is doing
4588346 although the gold price may fluctuate over the very long run gold has consistently reverted to its historic purchasing power parity against other commodities and intermediate products historically gold has proved to be an effective preserver of wealth it has also proved to be a safe haven in times of economic and social instability in a period of a long bull run in equities with low inflation and relative stability in foreign exchange markets it is tempting for investors to expect continual high rates of return on investments it sometimes takes a period of falling stock prices and market turmoil to focus the mind on the fact that it may be important to invest part of ones portfolio in an asset that will at least hold its value

4588359 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous

4588400 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4588401 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4588402 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are

4588407 we look very much forward to debating all of the candidates
4588408 the voters of the 13th congressional district deserve every possible opportunity to hear the substantial differences between christine jennings and vern buchanan from the candidates themselves
4588409 candidate debates are one of the cornerstones of our democratic system but so far during this campaign vern buchanan has tried to hide from any real debate on the issues and his record
4588410 it appears that hes made up his mind that hes not going to appear on any platform with chris jennings
4588411 for whatever reason he will not get on the platform with the other candidates for the 13th district race
4588412 it would imply that tiger bay would be endorsing him just as i could not have chris jennings come by herself because that would imply tiger bay club was endorsing her thats the quandary im in

4588435 at the rate the bigfoot creatures are advancing they may develop bulletproof skin and then wed be screwed because our firearms would be ineffective that would then leave only nuclear weapons for our defense and that might cause them to mutate into an even more highly evolved life form and bigfoot regime change wont work because we dont know which one of them is in charge so we must negotiate

4588438 i am a doctor and i have keen interest learning about herbs since beginning of my medical career i know that there are lots of researches on garlic on cholesterol and lipid profiles i have always recommended taking raw garlic pods to my patients with high cholesterol and lipid levels but they always skip doing it because of the strong odor thanks to morpheme garlic that is odorless capsules and even after consuming 3 4 capsules my patients complain nothing moreover the benefits of garlic have remained same my patients and i both are happy
4588439 i have been taking morpheme garlic since couple of months i do not suffer from any major health ailments touchwood but i take it for rejuvenation and i know that it is best aphrodisiac too for me kohinoor gold and garlic makes winning combination
4588440 it would make the world a better place if people were to get adjusted
4588441 ive always felt that i wanted to give it chiropractic care to anyone and everyone
4588442 of the amount of physical sexual and substance abuse they might have been through in their lives

4588457 how many observations should i make of each object it is most efficient to make two or three observations over a period of an hour or so per object per night observations of specific objects are best made on pairs of nearby nights as the accuracy of isolated single night observations can be difficult to judge by observing on pairs of nights any ambiguity is removed you should not make only one observation of each object per night neither should you make many more than three observations per objects per night it is a waste of your time and rarely helps the orbit solution however to make observations of a new discovery in groups many hours apart on a single night can be useful particularly in the case of an newly discovered object that may be close to the earth for multi opposition objects the preferable regimen of observing is observations on pairs on night in each dark run around each opposition until the object is numbered

4588498 under the papacy everything was pleasant and without annoyances fasting then was easier than eating is to us now to every day of fasting belonged three days of gorging for a collation one got two pots of good beer one small jug of wine and some ginger cake or salted bread to stimulate the thirst the poor brothers then left like fiery angels so red were they in the face
4588499 there was a lubeck israel an old klaus brandenburg a goslauer gose a hanover braehan a soltzman at saltzwedel a rastrun at leipsic beer of corvey beer of harlem dantzic brew eimbecker einbecker brew and many others the most celebrated of all was the braunschweig mumme named for its discoverer christian mumme 1492
4588500 there is more strength and nourishment in a little mug of this than a whole measure of other beers
4588501 luthers fondness for beer is well known and on the evening of that eventful day at worms april 18 1521 the duke erich von braunschweig sent him a pot of eimbecker einbecker beer to which he was specially addicted

4588504 whoever it was who invented the brewing of beer has been a curse for germany horses devour the greatest part of the grain for we grow more oats than rye the good peasants and the townspeople drink up almost as much of the grain in the form of beer
4588505 no doubt adam was a very sensible man and well practiced in a variety of trials he lived most temperately and drank neither wine nor beer i wish brewing had never been invented for a great deal of grain is consumed to make it and nothing good is brewed
4588506 the german prophet became a patriarch and the living room was dominated by his presence he enjoyed his beer and had a great mug with three rings on it one the ten commandments the next the creed and third the lords prayer he boasted that he could encompass all three with ease
4588507 i opposed indulgences and all the papists but never with force i simply taught preached and wrote gods word otherwise i did nothing and while i slept cf mark 4 26 29 or drank wittenberg beer with my friends philip and amsdorf the word so greatly weakened the papacy that no prince or emperor ever inflicted such losses upon it
4588508 it is possible to tolerate a little elevation when a man takes a drink or two too much after working hard and when he is feeling low this must be called a frolic but to sit day and night pouring it in and pouring it out again is piggish all food is a matter of freedom even a modest drink for ones pleasure if you do not wish to conduct yourself this way if you are going to go beyond this and be a born pig and guzzle beer and wine then if this cannot be stopped by the rulers you must know that you cannot be saved for god will not admit such piggish drinkers into the kingdom of heaven cf gal 5 19 21 if you are tired and downhearted take a drink but this does not mean being a pig and doing nothing but gorging and swilling you should be moderate and sober this means that we should not be drunken though we may be exhilarated

4588553 my round was well managed and i think that if you had to pinpoint something it was distance control so when i was uncomfortable with a certain hole location and there are going to be some of those on this course i was able to just hit the ball in the middle of the green and then give myself an easy two putt

4588613 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4588614 in order to bring a nation to support the burdens of great military establishments it is necessary to create an emotional state akin to psychology there must be the portrayal of external menace this involves the development of a nation hero nation villain ideology and the arousing of the population to a sense of sacrifice
4588615 this war may last for the rest of our lives

4588624 its sad to see it all go the way it is because if you look up and down in a lot of areas you see a lot of abandoned farms that are perfectly good farmland its just becoming more and more difficult
4588625 its so bad that we could lose it really fast
4588626 the processing is unravelling farm infrastructure is unravelling plants are closing and we see the loss of farms
4588627 we need to change really quickly we dont have any time to study this anymore we need to do something
4588628 now we have a report that says basically we told you so so now its time to do something
4588629 are we making the right move i dont know because were burning up our equity and taking on some debt and hoping that things will turn around
4588630 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4588631 i saw watchmen its fucking astounding the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen even alan moore might be surprised at how close the movie is to the book march cant come soon enough
4588632 enable me to make a sounder decision about the facts of the case
4588633 never intended to release important information that would allow or teach a bad guy
4588634 we simply want them to provide the information thats been requested by the court or the mbta
4588635 preventing them from talking about what they found even though theres a public debate if these students figured it out other people could figure it out too
4588636 las vegas three students at the massachusetts institute of technology mit were ordered this morning by a federal court judge to cancel their scheduled presentation about vulnerabilities in bostons transit fare payment system violating their first amendment right to discuss their important research
4588637 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
4588638 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
4588639 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
4588640 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

4588647 we will not sacrifice this investment and growth plan for short term results
4588648 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4588649 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4588650 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4588651 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4588652 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up

4588656 we believe the combination of nuance and zi delivers significant benefits to both companies shareholders
4588657 in addition to the clear immediate financial benefits to zi corp and its shareholders from our offer and particularly in view of todays announcement reporting further deterioration in financial performance it appears that zi faces numerous challenges in both the short and long term that further underscore the value of our offer to zi shareholders
4588658 it was our mission because of the strain and stress that all the farmers were under to get it out as fast we could i dont know that we could have done it any other way to be honest with you

4588663 this bid strengthens the existing relationship between plutonic and ge energy financial services and if successful would significantly expand ge s renewable energy base in the province of british columbia

4588785 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4588786 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4588787 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4588788 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4588789 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4588790 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4588791 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4588792 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there
4588793 i think it would be to his advantage to speak more to those kinds of voters and when i think he does that he always does very well
4588794 i think we will see him do more of that as we go through this year

4588871 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4588872 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the pre season flows so differently that you dont know how long the defence is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4588873 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4588874 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday

4588877 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way

4588893 strong allegiance to conservatism and conservative positions of young white evangelicals may be the product of dissatisfaction with this particular administration rather than the result of an underlying shift in this groups political values and policy views
4588894 republicans now have only a two to one advantage over democrats among younger white evangelicals compared with a nearly four to one edge in 2005
4588895 i do not agree with drilling for oil in an arctic reserve and i do believe that we should be less dependent on oil these are issues that are not traditionally republican
4588896 on the other hand i have tended to lean pro life and pro traditional marriage as well as free trade
4588897 it became clear to me that i couldnt be pro gay and a male feminist and be taken seriously as an evangelical

4588899 its tapped into the younger generation more but not exclusively
4588900 most of my evangelical christian friends at duke were liberals
4588901 i think some christians tend to focus on personal integrity and morality and end up on the right while some focus on the societal justice and equality side of christianity and end up on the left
4588902 has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4588903 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hardworking patriotic americans who call hawaii home
4588904 for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother and for him and his family to bond and recharge in his home state hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
4588905 i would resent anyone suggesting that my roots are not american
4588906 if he obama had gone someplace else people would be asking why didnt he go home to hawaii why didnt he go see his grandma
4588907 her home is a couple of blocks from the hospital he was born in from the school he went to honolulu is a little town its not some sort of exotic locality
4588908 aside from the fact that sen obama was born and raised here he really is just one of the millions of americans who choose to vacation in the islands and know that its part of the united states thats one of the advantages no passport is required and a dollar is dollar here sen obama or anyone else can do business worldwide 24 7 while in honolulu
4588909 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
4588910 after nprs cokie roberts suggested hawaii was an odd choice for barack obamas vacation
4588911 donald barella writes to say last i looked hawaii is one of the 50 states not a foreign place
4588912 it would have been devastating to everyone here if he had not done that
4588913 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4588914 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
4588915 i dont think anyone can credibly criticize senator obama for going back to the place where he was born to visit his grandmother where she happens to live

4588922 this case was about a teachers or administrators right to discipline students in a private catholic school
4588923 there must be unity and discipline for learning and spiritual formation to take place
4588924 the unifying element in this case was the english language because its the common denominator among the students teachers and administrators
4588925 this issue has been divisive and hurtful to our parish community and in that regard there are no winners
4588926 we want to move forward and continue educating our students and helping them develop spiritually and personally so they can be successful contributing members of our community of faith and the greater community as well

4588929 a physician who refuses to provide a service or refuses to accept a patient on the basis of a prohibited ground such as sex or sexual orientation may be acting contrary to the human rights code even if the refusal is based on the physicians moral or religious belief
4588930 for example a physician who is opposed to same sex procreation for religious reasons and therefore refuses to refer a homosexual couple for fertility treatment may be in breach of the code

4588942 american planes are going to bomb our homes just like we see them bomb towns and villages in iraq and afghanistan on the television news not just the government station but the bbc and cnn channels

4588948 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
4588949 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
4588950 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
4588951 every day there are 100 000 fewer cars in the city than before the introduction of the fee
4588952 in february 2003 there were only 90 electric cars in london in june 2008 it was more than 1600
4588953 the british buy about twice as many hybrid cars as germans and most of those who do drive in london
4588954 last year alone we put 250 vehicles on the road this year it will be considerably more
4588955 simply the coolest cheapest and most convenient way to get around town
4588956 we could put more cars on the road without any difficulty
4588957 driving these cars in a city is really a lot of fun
4588958 the cars lease is about four times that of a comparable smart that takes gas
4588959 but when you save 8 pounds a day and can often park for free because it is an electric car you make that money back fast
4588960 there are many ways for people to reduce their emissions
4588961 when you buy your next car simply choose the most economical option
4588962 i have heard that and i guess its probably an obvious question that someone is doing that i certainly i dont know the man i wouldnt recognize him if he were right in the room here i certainly dont think ive have never heard of anybody in the administration doing that if anyone did it would be extraordinarily improper
4588963 i would have to assume my name would be towards the top

4588968 of course its helpful for people to switch to energy efficient light bulbs or turn their central heating down cumulatively such changes will have a beneficial impact in fact some research shows that for a significant number of people the opposite is true having embraced one simple change some people then tend to rest on their laurels and be less likely to engage in other more significant changes
4588969 we need a different approach to motivating people to change one which stems from a re examination of the values upon which this change is built
4588970 four decades after his controversial book the population bomb scientist paul ehrlich still believes that overpopulation now along with overconsumption is the central environmental crisis facing the world and he insists technological fixes will not save the day
4588971 consumption is still viewed as an unalloyed good by many economists along with business leaders and politicians who tend to see jacking up consumption as a cure all for economic ills too much unemployment encourage people to buy an suv or a new refrigerator perpetual growth is the creed of the cancer cell but third rate economists cant think of anything else some leading economists are starting to tackle the issue of overconsumption but the problem and its cures are tough to analyze scientists have yet to develop consumption condoms or morning after shopping spree pills
4588972 well continue to hope and work for a cultural transformation in how we treat each other and the natural systems we depend upon we can create a peaceful and sustainable global civilization but it will require realistic thinking about the problems we face and a new mobilization of political will
4588973 we have waited long enough for us to pass this economic wilderness but as long as these talks drag on it can only mean worse things to come
4588974 going to work has become a waste of time as we still dont know anything about what the politicians are talking about or whether these talks will better our lives
4588975 ever since we voted in march life has become increasingly difficult and if these men the political leaders do not reach any agreement soon life for us will only get worse

4588977 the political crisis has always been intertwined with the economy therefore if there is no immediate agreement on the salient issues that all negotiating parties have tabled then zimbabweans can only watch and pray as things get worse
4588978 it is true that in any negotiations one must be prepared to bend backwards a bit but zimbabwes crisis appears to be very intricate as there is still strong belief among the countrys founding fathers that the opposition mdc wants to return the country to whites
4588979 what has worsened the situation for zimbabweans is that they do not know what the parties involved are talking about because of the media blackout imposed on the negotiating teams but it is the peoples fate being discussed so people should really have a right to know
4588980 no one wants to stay here people are leaving in their numbers because they have lost faith in the talks

4588989 it is not my remembering god it is gods remembering me that is the ground of my safety it is not my laying hold of his covenant but his covenants laying hold on me
4588990 and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh

4589091 do you think its a good idea to be playing with a boy who would do that
4589092 i understand but is it good to be playing with a boy who is mean to people
4589093 but is the tooth fairy real or do people just think he is
4589094 i think its just a person who gives me money
4589095 is the tooth fairy real please please tell me pretty please with a cherry on top
4589096 yes the tooth fairy is real but like all fairies she simply disappears when you stop believing in her
4589097 power is not the key control is and control starts with yourself
4589098 do you have enough money would you like to save for it heres how many weeks you would have to save
4589099 o k let me just get my man and my treasure and kitty

4589109 dear the atmosphere for womens in indian army is no god
4589110 this call connect me to that world we always want to respect
4589111 most women who come here have a sports oriented outlook or a national cadet corps background a greater percentage of the men who join do so because they view the army as a secure career option most women on the other hand come looking for adventure to do something different
4589112 even when we are posted at all male stations there is no difference only if we think and behave differently will we be treated differently and force to mind that otherwise we are all the same
4589113 it is the gentlemen cadets who feel discriminated against we earn the same pay but do not train for as long or as hard there is resentment and it is inevitable gender cannot be forgotten three hundred odd years of male attitudes cannot change so fast in any origination but army ethics include respect for women which is a help
4589114 women stepping into a mans world are more motivated dedicated and determined to prove a point they are excellent assets no matter where they are deployed
4589115 give them my bank acct number and they will promise me 40 of the millions that will temp hold the money in my acct
4589116 the fiction of detachment undermines the value of science writing i have also noticed that many real authorities in the natural sciences are not afraid to put themselves into their narratives although that may not be so true when they are writing for refereed journals my hero michael polanyi developed the idea that scientific knowledge is a matter of passionate belief which i take to mean belief in the methods skills and judgement employed by individuals to discover new knowledge
4589117 i affected a combination of the styles of macaulay and gibbon
4589118 the staccato antitheses of the former and the rolling sentences and genitival endings of the latter and i stuck in a bit of my own from time to time i began to see that writing especially narrative was not only an affair of sentences but of paragraphs indeed i thought the paragraph no less important than the sentence macaulay is a master of paragraphing just as the sentence contains one idea in all its fullness so the paragraph should embrace a distinct episode and as sentences should follow one another in harmonious sequence so the paragraphs must fit on to one another like the automatic couplings of railway carriages
4589119 but once it goes over cuba it looks like it will affect florida in some form or fashion

4589134 rose 8 2 percent to 30 8 trillion in 2004 giving them control of nearly a quarter of the worlds financial assets
4589135 approximately 790 million people in the developing world are still chronically undernourished almost two thirds of whom reside in asia and the pacific
4589136 there are still around 1 billion people living at the margins of survival on less than us 1 a day with 2 6 billion 40 percent of the worlds population living on less than us 2 a day
4589137 preliminary recalculations of global economic output excluding differences in domestic prices and currencies released by the world bank in mid december 2007 may undermine the much trumpeted claims that globalisation has reduced the number of people living in extreme poverty
4589138 a large understatement of the extent of global income poverty and to an incorrect inference that it has declined
4589139 a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable
4589140 today across the world 1 3 billion people live on less than one dollar a day 3 billion live on under two dollars a day 1 3 billion have no access to clean water 3 billion have no access to sanitation 2 billion have no access to electricity
4589141 almost half the worlds population lives on less than two dollars a day yet even this statistic fails to capture the humiliation powerlessness and brutal hardship that is the daily lot of the worlds poor
4589142 the bad news is that this has not been translated into accelerated progress in cutting under nutrition
4589143 as high as this number seems surveys show that it underestimates the actual number of children who though enrolled are not attending school
4589144 indigenous and afro descended people are at considerable disadvantage with respect to whites with the latter earning the highest wages in the region
4589145 the economic case for high executive pay in terms of company performance doesnt hold up and because highly unequal societies have a habit of falling apart
4589146 can try to address inequality but they will anger the rich

4589149 oil corporations cannot be transformed into development agencies even with the best intentions and monitoring mechanisms
4589150 global levers of development outcomes like the world bank cannot exercise sufficient clout on oil multinationals penchant for profits
4589151 the world bank is incapable of respecting its own weakening safeguard policies which are premised on controlling damage rather than avoiding harm this is particularly significant as africa banks on the increasing trend in foreign direct investments fdis
4589152 the embryonic neo liberal governance structures in africa are incapable of forcing fdis which are principally attracted by ground mineral resources to respect ecological and social principles this cannot be over stressed especially as the world bank prepares to engage in what it calls high risk high reward projects in developing countries
4589153 the flawed contention of the world bank is you cannot eat omelettes without breaking some eggs as this paper has demonstrated the eggs most often broken are those of the poor who are left with no alternative livelihood
4589154 public private partnership ppp the buzz paradigm of sustainable development is fundamentally incapable of addressing the unequal power relation between fattening multinationals weakening states and the world bank in this era of globalisation
4589155 the investment agreements governing the project risk seriously undermining the ability and willingness of chad and cameroon to protect their citizens human rights making the oil companies de facto unaccountable in the pipeline zone
4589156 there is a prevailing climate of fear and intimidation around the pipeline some of whose critics have already been arrested and intimidated
4589157 in 1989 the united states had 66 billionaires and 31 5 million people living below the official poverty line a decade later the united states has 268 billionaires and 34 5 million people living below the poverty line about 13 000 for a three person family
4589158 that the united states is the only industrialised nation that views health care as a privilege not a basic human right
4589159 the literacy of american adults ranks 10th out of 17 industrialized countries

4589403 peak oil is real and its not in the future it was actually in may of 2005 but you wont hear much about it in the msm if we had truth in reporting laws the main stream media would have to be renamed the main stream propaganda it bears no resemblance to news or truth alas we passed world peak oil production over three years ago production was less in 2006 even lower in 2007 and still lower in 2008 prices are high because demand exceeds supply when you pump oil from the ground most of the time you are also pumping 4 20 barrels of water as well the water is contaminated with both oil and solids basically sand the oilfield operator needs to do two things he wants to recover as much oil as possible and he wants to get rid of the water the easiest and cheapest way the water remediation unit produced and patented by wescorp is simple in theory you feed ultra tiny bubbles of natural gas or nitrogen through a tank of contaminated water i think the 2000 bpd unit i saw had a green 12 foot upright tank i was told the bubbles are so tiny that they take 28 minutes to travel from the bottom of the tank to the top oil is lighter than water so they collect the now free oil at the top of the tank and the solids from the bottom of the tank new fluids are constantly fed into the tank so a 220 liter tank can process 2000 bpd of fluids its very important to understand that the contaminated water cannot simply be fed back into the existing well it is contaminated with sands and solids and would soon clog up the entire reservoir so no oil would be produced so every field has exhausted wells where contaminated water can be pumped wescorp has the best water remediation unit by an order of magnitude i was told that up to 3 more oil could be produced from the tar sands just recovering the oil from the contaminated water thats giant the magic for investors isnt just in this being such an environmentally friendly process its going to make a lot of money for wescorp i saw the first unit put into production in april and i was very impressed all the numbers worked for 1400 a day the operator was saving 4 000 6 000 per day in expenses for filters trucking and contaminating wells

4589572 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult

4589600 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4589606 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions
4589607 from day one the questions were all about how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4589608 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful
4589609 i think its going to take some time to build that organization to where tony might want to see it

4589617 maybe a rider was going through a hard time in a relationship or just dealing with everyday stress
4589618 so often athletes are put on a pedestal and looked at as beyond the realm of human suffering
4589619 but just because you are privileged athletically doesnt mean you are removed from the trauma of life and even if you dont have any hardships going on youll still want to know how to improve as an athlete
4589620 in general i think cyclists are people who take responsibility for themselves so seeing a psychotherapist is an extension of that you take care of your training and diet and this is just one more part of that
4589621 the biggest thing is that you want to use your head in a way that is for you not against you
4589622 after a crash dont think about crashing again instead remember how many times youve ridden and didnt crash
4589623 when we were riding today you were saying things about pain and commenting about future riding being affected by your crash
4589624 well if you were racing saturday wed want to work on how to separate the experience of pain from the idea of making an automatic conclusion about how you are going to feel on saturday the experience of pain is one thing but how you associate with it is what makes a lot of difference
4589625 its one thing to say this hurts but another to say its limited hurt and im not dieing and i can deal with it
4589626 but how many times have you woken up and felt bad then gone out and had a great training day the more you realize that the better you need to make it the best ride you can and not focus only on the one bad time and get tunnel vision on that one time
4589627 you shouldnt ignore or neglect the fact that youre sore and feel more vulnerable but at the same time you dont want to let it color your entire performance
4589628 no one who excels gets to that level without facing hurdles anticipated and unanticipated its how you choose to work with those challenges that can make a big difference in your experience longevity and enjoyment of your sport
4589629 a lot of it is about being comfortable with your talent and strengths in order to be good at anything you have to make an accurate assessment of where you are at feel good about your strengths and recognize what the weaknesses you need to improve

4589703 the results of these campaigns on the intermarkets portfolio of sites including the drudge report lucianne com cnsnews com creators com sweetness light com and rasmussenreports com demonstrates that the internet is a dominant media force in political campaigning and a major source of political information for many americans
4589704 we are thrilled that fundraisers are realizing firsthand the value of reaching out to the millions of people who visit the intermarkets portfolio of sites everyday
4589705 during this election year intermarkets has been working with a variety of non partisan philanthropic organizations political campaigns and issue advocacy groups to generate interest in their ideas policies and candidates as well as raising millions of dollars for the groups and campaigns candidates are realizing that they cant rely on just traditional media like television newspapers and radio to deliver their messages to voters the web is where younger voters are now failure to draw on web media could result in the complete loss of an entire generation of donors and voters

4589707 benjamin lallys elaborate walt whitman parody mashes up familiar quotations with modern pop culture references while consistently maintaining a whitmanesque grandiose voice and lust for life i like how this poem builds momentum with ever more extravagant claims for the narrators genius yet never breaks character though it is recognizably a parody it stands alone as a humorous poem in its own right

4589709 its hard to imagine what music would be like without bmi before world war ii there was only one kind of music that seemed to be allowed in america it was continuation of what had been the european tradition of 32 bar songs whether they came from shows or popular songwriters and it was an elite club the lid was kept on rhythm amp blues music country music ethnic music folk once the lid was lifted which happened when bmi entered the picture the vacuum was filled by all of these archetypical american musics bmi turned out to be the mechanism that released all those primal american forms of music that fused and became rock amp roll
4589710 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4589711 television networks should be setting a higher standard of pronunciation and fulfilling their role of informing and educating the viewing public

4589714 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4589746 it was a euphoric experience for me after 35 years of searching for this thing it just blew me away there i was face to face with this thing it was about 7 feet tall and it weighs over 500 pounds it had five fingers and five toes very much like a human his feet were in excess of 16 inches and his hands from the palm to the middle finger were in excess of 11 inches the teeth were protruding because rigor mortis had set in and the tongue was out its guts were also out of its stomach and it looked like the gasses in the body caused this because they had this thing since june 10 or 12 i dont remember exactly but they had it for about two months they were afraid they didnt know what to think about what they had

4589751 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4589752 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4589753 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4589783 if the job was easy then even more people would be doing it
4589784 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
4589785 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
4589786 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
4589787 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
4589788 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
4589789 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
4589790 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
4589791 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
4589792 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
4589793 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
4589794 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
4589795 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
4589796 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
4589797 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
4589798 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
4589799 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
4589800 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
4589801 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
4589802 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
4589803 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
4589804 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
4589805 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
4589806 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
4589807 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
4589808 at the point the officer stopped mr jones smelled the alcohol on his breath talked to him about the law and realized he was under 21 years old

4589818 it seems to me that the united states has to have a darned good reason to break off relations with russia and go back to the dark days of the cold war
4589819 i dont believe events thus far provide that reason both sides need the other too much
4589820 we have never profited much by not talking to people with whom we dont have common ground
4589821 i have never believed we are very effective at trying to play the game of reward and punishment with a nation as big as russia
4589822 the missile defense deal with poland certainly raises the ante and i believe that the timing is anything but accidental
4589823 we should not take our eye off the immediate issue which is for the first time since the end of the soviet union russian troops have invaded and are occupying another country
4589824 but isolating russia is not really an option it will not be isolated it is too big it is too powerful
4589825 if for some reason or another the russians proceed with their occupation go to tbilisi and topple saakashvili then we are probably in a world where russia finds itself outside the community of nations and some type of militarized rivalry is likely to return

4589997 dude youre already so late and too old to be entering into medical school process just hurry up and do it
4589998 as a surgical resident in an academic medical center i start the day at 4 am and i am working at full speed until around 6pm when things slow down assuming no traumas come to the er and then i usually get most work done by 8pm anything left over goes to the resident on call i am the resident on call every third or fourth night which means i dont sleep for 30 hours or more for that period i never have time to eat during the day and i have to make time to even pee i think about quitting every day but in the end ive invested way too much to leave it all now the rules say im not supposed to work more than 80 hours a week but i am consistently at 90 110 hours a week there is just way too much to do and not enough surgeons to handle all the patients who need to be taken care of i work at least 6 days a week sometimes 12 days in a row and ive done this for about 4 years now after med school and this is pretty typical for any surgeon so the idea of a 4 day work week or any work week under 80 hours is an absolute joke to me if anyone says surgeons make too much money they clearly have no idea what a surgeon goes through or how the medical system works
