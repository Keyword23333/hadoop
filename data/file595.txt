5950002 ive seen the pictures of the baby she looks like john edwards
5950003 that was bad enough but he also has an unnatural interest in guns and weapons
5950004 he spoke openly of his wish to be a sniper and spoke of his curiosity of what it would be like to kill someone
5950005 he is at risk of being a violent young man and a threat to society
5950006 he is not a muslim he is not driven by ideology he is too young to spell the word
5950007 but he is being influenced and intoxicated by the imagery and appeal of jihadist and other internet violence
5950008 a decision on additional services will be made when the infrastructure improvements have been completed
5950009 at the point of completion we will look at the business case for the hourly service again
5950010 i think the more frequent the service the more attractive it is to the travelling public
5950011 it is something the liaison committee is in support of and we will be reflecting the support that has been given to improving the service by the constituent parts of the committee
5950012 our research shows there is a clear need for a more frequent service on this line as at the moment it isnt meeting passenger demands
5950013 its great news theres a lot of history here and there were another couple of clubs who were trying to lay claim to the title but the racecourse beats them both by more than 20 years
5950014 i spent a couple of months researching how to put a case to guinness and eventually wrote to them
5950015 they said i needed to prove that the venue was still being used for internationals and because there werent any scheduled i had to write to the football association of wales to ask for their support
5950016 i got a letter back confirming that they will be playing senior internationals there in the future
5950017 that was all that was needed and guinness confirmed everything a couple of months later
5950018 we were contacted a few months ago by lifelong wrexham fan glyn davies who believed the racecourse ground to be the oldest international football ground
5950019 today after receiving confirmation from the faw that the racecourse will still be used for senior international matches we are delighted to confirm that the racecourse is indeed the holder of the guinness world record for oldest international football ground
5950020 this is a wonderful achievement to have confirmed by guinness world records and i congratulate glyn davies on his excellent detective work in establishing the record as being correct
5950021 i live alone and what takes the average person half an hour takes me an hour if not longer just getting dressed in the morning is a mammoth task
5950022 by the time i go into the kitchen to get breakfast i can be exhausted i cant just pop to the shops it all has to be planned
5950023 i try to lead a normal life but i do get frustrated
5950024 the worst thing about my condition is that my mobility is getting worse and i have no control over it
5950025 while doctors cannot treat proteus syndrome research into the causes of the condition is ongoing in the uk supported by the medical board of the proteus family network uk
5950026 commodore bainimarama agreed with and accepted the seven point communiqu on fiji and so told all the leaders present at the retreat
5950027 sir michael somare and i certainly did not pressure him into making those commitments to have elections next march as we and all the leaders are keen on helping fiji move forward but fiji has to play its due part
5950028 there is no question as the report is a good one and no doubt the leaders will support it
5950029 involve substantive unresolved questions of church life womens incorporation in ministry and decision making

5950045 while russia and america see the conflict in abstract terms about spheres of influence and protecting allies for ossetians who still recall the centuries of massacres georgians committed against them it is highly personal
5950046 is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe its time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6 7
5950047 what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled
5950048 today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war it doesnt matter what their propaganda says
5950049 georgian president mikhail saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations
5950050 the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies
5950051 if nato wants to cooperate with criminals we cant stop them but we cannot cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals
5950052 if the european union had not moved tbilisi would have been captured
5950053 we will keep our very good bilateral contacts with nato members and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible
5950054 the kvm is one of those devices that ive always known about but never actually used as far as brands go aten is definitely up there in the world of awareness so they seemed like the logical company to check out the kvm as a device isnt all that confusing it simply lets you use two or more depending on the model computers while only needing a single keyboard video screen and mouse or kvm over the past 18 months i would have liked to have ventured into the world that is the kvm but since my upgrade to dual link dvi enabled monitors it hasnt been possible as the dvi side of things on all kvms only support a maximum of 1920 x 1200 until now that is aten have come to the rescue with the release of the cs1782 a few months back it was really the only kvm released within the past few years that managed to grab my attention so i simply had to have it before we get into talking about the overall feelings on the device lets take the time to have a quick look at the package and whats inside

5950073 im not going to tell you whether ive asked mr bachchan to shave off his beard or not but for sure this is going to be his most startling makeover in recent times balakrishna who is also known as balki told ians
5950074 while abhishek will be given a more intrinsic personality change im totally changing mr bachchans look
5950075 pa would be a far more emotional story than cheeni kum which was far more caustic dry and sharp tongued
5950076 actually cheeni kum was inspired by one scene in raj khoslas dostana where mr bachchan had confronted zeenat aman the look of utter disdain and sarcasm in his eyes remained with me thats how his character in cheeni kum was born
5950077 while in cheeni kum he was a character i had seen earlier in pa hes a totally different person it a very emotional father son story but the emotions wont be melodramatic
5950078 amitji will have no love interest his world revolves around his son will i borrow from mr bachchans real life relationship with abhishek no in fact i know them so well that ill make sure i avoid all references to their real life
5950079 ah ilayaraja again i worship the man and the cinematography will be by none other than p c sreeram again after cheeni kum

5950187 id be walking and just kind of topple over a little bit no rhyme or reason i hadnt been drinking or anything and boom and some memory things which does start to happen when you get a little older
5950188 i had some concerns so in 2003 i got tested
5950189 the doctor told my uncle i think you have huntingtons disease and he said what the hell is that
5950190 were trying to create awareness of it and the fact that if a cure is found for any neurological disease like alzheimers all neurological diseases will be affected which is good news
5950191 our job is to help families who have huntingtons there is no cure or treatment but we provide support we have support groups for families and a 24 hour hotline
5950192 at omrf we recently have discovered a metabolic pathway that may explain how folic acid and oxidation fit into the huntingtons disease process and why the experimental treatment has failed
5950193 most excitingly we have discovered that the naturally occurring product of this newly identified pathway may protect against huntingtons
5950194 in studies of mice with huntingtons we found that this product and related compounds that we have created in our labs improved disease symptoms substantially at the moment were performing a research project that will cast new light on this promising pathway and examine how it might be manipulated to help patients

5950197 its a long time since ive seen brazil so stingy and defensive
5950198 i didnt think they could do any damage they never managed to play their way out of defence nobody helped ronaldinho and they never played coherently i think argentina were better in every metre of the field
5950199 ronaldinho is a role model both inside and outside the brazilian team
5950200 i think he has a bright future ahead of him and he will help us alot in the and i am looking forward to that
5950201 we have to form a circle to protect the man but the battle is being won the security has been well organised
5950202 weve got to tighten up the amateur programme so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5950203 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5950204 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
5950205 back in the day amateur boxing was on tv every weekend in the states
5950206 when you have a good amateur programme it helps develop well rounded boxers look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles
5950207 when youre a pro you avoid the fighters whose style doesnt suit your style it makes them weak amateur boxing is harder than pro you have to fight everybody in your draw

5950209 we won in the way we like to win we kept faith in our style of play and we won deservedly
5950210 weve learned the lesson that with brazil you have to wait for them and not go straight out and attack
5950211 we knew that brazil would wait for us and that we had to have patience and not rush into attacking them we played a great game in every sense and in every part of the field
5950212 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5950213 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5950214 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5950215 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5950230 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons

5950247 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
5950248 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
5950249 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
5950250 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality

5950300 i dont think hes a guy who needs the emotional lift or adrenaline rush of a save situation
5950301 hes just being a little bit fine with the fastball
5950302 every hit in the ninth inning is big but we couldnt get that really big one at the end
5950303 the team going out there and scoring four runs made it a lot easier to go out and throw strikes
5950304 thats just not how i pitch im not the most dominating pitcher but usually i can keep my team in the game
5950305 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5950306 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5950307 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5950308 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5950309 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5950310 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5950311 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5950312 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5950313 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5950314 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5950315 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5950316 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5950317 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5950318 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5950319 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5950320 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5950321 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5950322 who are open to doing something on the production side
5950323 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5950324 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5950325 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5950326 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5950327 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5950328 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5950329 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5950330 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5950331 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5950332 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5950333 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5950334 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5950335 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5950336 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5950337 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5950338 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5950339 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5950340 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5950341 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5950342 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5950343 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5950344 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5950345 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5950346 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5950347 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5950348 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5950349 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5950350 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5950351 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5950352 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5950353 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5950354 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5950355 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5950356 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5950357 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5950358 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5950359 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5950360 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5950361 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5950362 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5950363 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5950364 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5950365 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5950366 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5950367 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5950368 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5950369 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5950370 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5950371 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5950372 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5950373 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5950374 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5950375 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5950376 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5950377 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5950378 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5950379 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5950380 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5950381 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5950382 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5950383 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5950384 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5950385 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5950386 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5950387 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5950388 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5950389 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5950421 a perfect example of why the american notion of a free public education is a bad idea hes nothing more than a wad of protoplasm a deadhead that one i should have failed him but that would have meant another semester reading his bloated prolixity so i promoted him im so ashamed
5950422 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
5950423 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation

5950465 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
5950466 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
5950467 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
5950468 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
5950469 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
5950470 we are aware of the current situation of higher prices

5950474 yes i am an agent for the malays as well as the indians and chinese
5950475 playing on the racial line is a very dangerous game the people are not that stupid now compared to years ago umno is a sinking ship and its leaders are holding on to it to stay in power
5950476 these projects were given out through direct instructions from him to the contracts division in the finance ministry
5950477 what he did when he was in power contradicts his claims that he wants to bring prosperity to all malaysians but anwar is trying to divert the issue by asking his detractors to name his cronies i categorically state that there is such a scheme and i challenge him to sue if the allegations are wrong

5950488 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems
5950489 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5950490 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5950491 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5950492 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus
5950493 like children who learn a new language more easily than adults so too did the cats and dogs learn their new language more easily the younger they were
5950494 when the baby is born after the dog has become accustomed to a certain amount of attention and the focus now turns to the newborn child the status quo is altered
5950495 an analogy can be drawn with homes in which a dog is adopted either before or after a baby is born when the dog enters a home with a baby in residence the status quo is already in place however when the baby is born after the dog has become accustomed to a certain amount of attention and the focus now turns to the newborn child the status quo is altered and the dog will often display behaviour resembling jealousy
5950496 a quick review of the data collected by the key chain with their teen driver provides parents an opportunity to positively reinforce good driving habits or take appropriate action to modify poorer ones
5950497 and it gives teens an opportunity to show they are responsible drivers
5950498 the main focus is that the teenager is aware that their parents will be aware therefore they wont drive recklessly in the first place because they want the car next weekend
5950499 it is a preventative device not a catch you tattle tale device

5950501 from a marketers point of view you want to have the athletes in the news pages as well as the sports pages so if that can happen for the good reasons the right reasons thats great

5950504 stephanies like a bullet from nowhere as far as the publics concerned
5950505 weve know about her for eight years so shes not suddenly a new star on the block
5950506 shell probably still earn a quarter of a million dollars a year or more but all the money those rivers of cash will go to stephanie rice
5950507 he wont earn as much as he could have done if hed won a gold medal
5950508 so not winning a gold medal has probably cost him millions of dollars
5950509 hes not on the scale of say stephanie rice who has three medals or libby trickett theyre much hotter and thats what the marketers will go to where the advertisers will put their money
5950510 sex sells even grant hackett is not as hot as stephanie rice at the moment
5950511 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5950512 it could also be due to mothers deciding not to seek more senior jobs because of the difficulties of balancing family commitments with the increased demands
5950513 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5950514 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5950515 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5950516 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5950517 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5950518 in the uk it seems to be constantly raining and yet the reservoirs seem to dry out so quickly you have towns flooded the whole time and yet hosepipe bans are in force
5950519 theres just not enough being spent on infrastructure and the pipelines are just really bad thames water is dreadful they blame it on the wartime damagethat nothings been really properly repaired since the 1940s
5950520 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
5950521 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
5950522 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5950523 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected

5950525 women who were more symmetrical tended to have more typical feminine traits such as larger hips longer and more slender legs and larger breasts
5950526 in many species these departures are related to poor health lower survival and fewer offspring
5950527 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations
5950528 currently autism diagnosis is purely behaviour based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities
5950529 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5950530 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5950531 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that

5950540 mum can purchase and prepare the food but dads will often have less greens or just meat and potato the kids think mum makes me eat this and she is painted as the bad guy
5950541 fathers influence the food and physical activity habits in the home through their behaviours attitudes and approach to food and eating and act as a role model to their children
5950542 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
5950543 i began testing all sorts of plastic until i found my fathers record collection and then i started recycling those without his knowledge
5950544 they customers tell us theyd like a film from woody allen or they want mission impossible 3 in their frame or they want a picture of some famous actor then we will make it here and ship it to them

5950548 distance running in africa comes from how people have always traveled over long distances on foot
5950549 i heard about a study done recently theyve discovered some particular protein that they think plays a roll in sprinting it is only present in something like 30 of the population cant remember if thats world wide or just the us or what but it is in over 70 of jamaicans
5950550 we are dedicated to creating a happy atmosphere at the closing ceremony the message is to say goodbye and to promise to meet again in four years
5950551 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimise for those properties
5950552 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5950553 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modelling can do
5950554 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5950558 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
5950559 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
5950560 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
5950561 if youre in sub sahara africa you dont give a damn about wall street
5950562 theres only one country where i dont see that attitude this one
5950563 the whole idea that this game has been in development for over ten years is just a complete myth
5950564 we have tried to say that for the last four years but nobody seems to want to listen so you would a service to everyone by saying that once we hooked up with microsoft and started collaborating is when the real development of too human started
5950565 down to pre conceived notions from things that they previewers have heard everyone is different ive had people write us to say that their 4 year old daughter got into the game within five minutes because they didnt have any preconceived notions of trying to control the camera with the right stick they just enjoyed the game right away
5950566 so i posted there on neogaf to say okay there is a significant loss of reciprocity accuracy there is no responsibility for some of these posts that are occurring and it was affecting things
5950567 at the end of the day is it more important to stand up for something that you believe in and potentially lose
5950568 okay forums dont matter they dont have an affect lets just not talk about it
5950569 were the type of company as an example if we saw some woman being hit on the street by someone else well step in and try to break it up despite the fact that we might get stabbed or whatever at the end of the day were going to try to do the right thing

5950573 to wrap up marshall sponder discussed the use of web 2 0 social media is about the conversation just as matt bailey said that it is about asking questions having that interaction will get us all up to the next level of measurement and understanding marshall shares that in order to get the most conversions you need to treat the visitors from twitter differently than the visitors from forums and differently from the direct visitors and within the social space there are millions of conversations going on daily but how do you measure this conversation marshall mentioned using monitoring tools such as radian6 to track the effects of a social media conversation without measuring the conversation and the outcomes of that conversation you are missing out on a huge chunk of useful data it seems from this panel that the best way to measure web 2 0 success is to ask questions of the data and challenge yourself to find the results in the communication happening between users these questions and communication could easily generate a new idea for tracking and monitoring which will benefit clients and companies in the long run

5950575 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

5950579 hey hey you you i want to be your girlfriend
5950580 hes the first to propose a budget that tops 3 trillion only six years ago he was the first to propose one that topped 2 trillion america is the proud owner of the largest government on earth
5950581 in some cases the federal government imposes new rules and regulations on lower governments and those governments must raise taxes to cover the cost of compliance
5950582 and complying with regulations costs private sector organizations big money too they pass the costs along to us through increases in the price of consumer goods
5950583 so regulations end up costing us hard earned money just as taxes do
5950584 precisely crews report calculates that regulatory compliance costs hit 1 16 trillion in 2007 an amount almost half the size of the federal budget itself federal regulations gobbled up nearly 10 percent of what the u s economy produced last year
5950585 in 2007 nearly 3 600 new rules and regulations were added since 1995 when the small government republicans took over congress 51 000 rules and regulations have been added
5950586 the federal register which contains all the rules and regulations is more than 72 000 pages thick down a touch from previous years but still massive nonetheless
5950587 it all starts with lawmaking in response to a social or economic need or problem congress passes a law the appropriate regulatory agency then interprets that law and writes regulations that define how the law will be implemented
5950588 the fda creates its regulations under the authority of the food drug and cosmetics act the controlled substances act and several other acts created by congress over the years based on the acts the fda creates specific regulations that determine what food and drug companies can and cannot do
5950589 do you mean government bureaucrats not elected officials are really the ones determining what people and organizations can and cannot do
5950590 yep there are more than 50 regulatory agencies in the federal government and each is empowered to create and enforce rules and regulations that are backed by the might of federal law individuals and organizations can be fined or thrown in jail for violating them
5950591 it can be ominous which is why regulators must be kept in check but where regulations are concerned crews says nobody is doing that
5950592 disclosure and accountability crews argues that regulatory costs should be accounted for just like federal spending cost benefit analysis should be provided before a regulation is imposed and when a regulation will cost more than 100 million to comply with the congress should be required to vote on the regulation before it becomes binding
5950593 he also argues that congress should create a regulatory report card to monitor regulatory agencies
5950594 that crews fellow has some really good ideas but isnt he overlooking the primary benefit of an incredibly thick federal register
5950595 if the iranians dont shape up we can threaten to drop it on them
5950596 to expound the words as to touch the peoples hearts
5950597 your site is very informative n helpful thanks keep it up
5950598 hmm how can such a brilliant tool be free what if there is a hook
5950599 daas sometimes refers to first principles but sometimes it refers to acquired knowledge
5950600 a particular term will sometimes be substituted for another i
5950601 the book is written in plain language technical terms have been avoided as much as possible because there is always the danger of letting such terms substitute for clear thinking
5950602 wtf do you need to sign confidentiality agreements why so secretive
5950603 history of psychedelic dance music from 1968 2008 with live visuals provided by alton
5950604 one great thing about hockey is that youre able to display aggressive behavior in an acceptable manner you dont have to go to prison or whatnot for striking someone with an elbow it makes a good setting to look at aggression
5950605 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
5950606 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
5950607 for example if people were asked to rate how aggressive men were was on the basis of photographs would their ratings be accurate
5950608 these are the types of follow up research questions that we are now investigating
5950609 perhaps what the authors have documented is not an effect of masculine facial qualities and effects of testosterone but rather behavioral compensation for the social effects of babyfaceness
5950610 surprisingly i have found that their behavior is opposite to these expectations something that could be attributed to a self defeating prophecy effect whereby babyfaced men overcompensate for social expectations that are unpleasant for young men
5950611 well if you dont plan on working to get it how are you gonna accomplish this mighty feat
5950612 at closest approach the asteroid will shine like a 3rd magnitude star visible to the unaided eye from africa europe and asia even through city lights
5950613 close approaches by objects as large as 2004 mn4 are currently thought to occur at 1000 year intervals on average
5950614 our ability to see where 2004 mn4 will go by extrapolating its orbit is so blurred out by the 2029 earth encounter it cant even be said for certain what side of the sun 2004 mn4 will be on in 2035 talk of earth encounters in 2035 is premature
5950615 allowing us to calculate the details of the 2029 flyby
5950616 if we get radar ranging in 2013 we should be able to predict the location of 2004 mn4 out to at least 2070
5950617 radar could detect the distortion of 2004 mn4s shape and spin as it passes through earths gravity field how the asteroid changes or not would provide information about its internal structure and material composition
5950618 we hope that through our actions people will see how special it is and the army will repair what they did here we simply want them to allow people to come back to homesh

5950724 coach has been telling the team that we are the only team in the league that can really go on a five or six game winning streak
5950725 maybe its that time right now that we can get on it
5950726 we dont know what their team is going to be we kind of guessed
5950727 i think they have maybe three players who have played consistently this season because of the injuries
5950728 we always tell the guys you have to play them as if theyre going to have their best game
5950729 one thing i can say about chivas the thing i give them a ton of respect and a ton of compliments on is they work hard
5950730 preki does a good job of getting his players to play hard for each other
5950731 its time for us who have not been starting to go in there and do what the other players have been doing keeping the team on the streak its on
5950732 i feel like its coming but i need to get it down sooner rather than later
5950733 you get to the quarterback you disrupt the offense its that simple its the preseason but this is when we set the foundation for the regular season right now wed like to put more pressure on the quarterback and were continually in the process of trying to do that its the coaches job to put players in position to make plays theyre in the process of finding that right mix
5950734 im really trying to focus on getting the basic techniques down

5950739 i know that hes capable of rushing the passer ive played against him too many times
5950740 i didnt see bringing him in to be a gamble i thought he could help us and i still hope he can
5950741 honestly we havent been very good with four guys getting to the quarterback but were going to keep working on it we have to we proved to ourselves last year that if weve got to call pressure blitzes all the time to get to the quarterback our team is probably in trouble

5950750 he was real strong and i think thats how come he grew up really fast
5950751 and the people in audience are so happy to see the game all i think of is that lonbaye needs to see him play i know hes watching though
5950752 but i think i used it to empower myself to do better things
5950753 hes very bright articulate dedicated and he never screws around

5950772 but last friday night i criticized my 89 year old mother for buying peruvian asparagus at loblaws when she should be considering the carbon footprint of what she buys she looked at me like i was nuts

5950829 there are no two opinions about the need to switch over to other modes of power generation like nuclear energy and hydro coal based power production has to be restricted
5950830 coal based power generation is not a feasible proposition coal stocks are limited and might not be there always to generate power at such a large scale
5950831 from april 2007 to january 2008 around 255 million tonnes of coal was supplied to power utilities against the annual action plan target of 249 97 million tonnes
5950832 the situation is grim and unless fast track measures are undertaken by the ministry of coal and coal companies the ntpc stations face serious threat of taking units out of bar
5950833 which is why we have advised the ministry of power to retain the target of importing 20 million tonnes of coal for power plants in 2008 09 it will help them build up coal stocks at power houses
5950834 a long term solution to meet increasing electricity needs lies in switching over to hydro and other renewable modes for generating energy
5950835 two things are important in spreading micro credit in india one is legislation to create micro credit banks small banks who does this lending of micro credit to the poorest people and then a regulatory authority which oversees this operation
5950836 we are trying to go into healthcare because if you are poor it almost implies without question that you are poor in health so it goes together so we are trying to see now that we have brought the micro credit the financial service how to bring the health care to the poor people and its possible
5950837 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5950838 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic
5950839 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why don
5950840 our information is specific to being in an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5950841 this submission from the dpp australia s primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice
5950842 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5950843 they must acknowledge a dangerous and painful truth key leaders of pakistans military and its inter services intelligence agency have long collaborated with armed islamic extremists operating in afghanistan the indian province of kashmir and pakistans own tribally administered regions along the afghan border in their eyes these extremists serve pakistans strategic interests in reality as the times has extensively reported these militants kill american and nato soldiers indian diplomats and pakistani civilians
5950844 it will take personal courage and broad political support to clean up these forces and finally bring them under civilian control pakistans leaders will better their odds if they stop pretending that the fight against terrorism is somehow americas problem and not pakistans they will also have to stop pretending that ad hoc cease fires and bribes to insurgent leaders can roll back the taliban threat
5950845 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties and rule by decree
5950846 i am happy to participate in the programme glad the democratic party asked us to go green and will definitely consider using this option again
5950847 in india a leading magazines analysis of carbon emissions emphasised the per capita measure which in indias case is relatively low
5950848 in the us news reports highlighted the totality of a countrys carbon emissions which put india and china into the hot seat of being the worlds biggest polluters
5950849 the differences point to the need for extraordinary political leadership to effectively tackle global problems such as climate change
5950850 now the government is planning to plant 45 50 lakh 4 5 5 million medicinal and wild fruit plants under the programme next year
5950851 our aim is to plant saplings throughout the year to take in the polluted air and release life sustaining oxygen for us and play host to animals and insects
5950852 himachal pradesh is in fact the first state in the country to take the initiative in combating climate change at the micro level
5950853 once the villagers start understanding its economic benefits the programme would gain momentum
5950854 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
5950855 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
5950856 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
5950857 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good

5950941 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5950942 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5950943 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option

5950945 pokoknya kita harus membersihkan saluran air sampah sampah harus dibuang ke tempatnya kita keruk sampah yang ada di saluran air agar air bisa berjalan lancar
5950946 huh ternyata bohong di lembur kita masih ada gotong royong teh ternyata tidak ada seorang pun yang mau ikut bekerja untuk kepentingan bersama
5950947 kajeun teuing tidak ada yang membantu juga biarlah saya juga masih bisa mengerjakannya sendiri
5950948 huh baru kerukan pertama sudah ada sampah plastik jigana mah makin ke sana makin banyak sampah plastiknya
5950949 wah banyak kang banyak orang di lembur kita yang membuang sampah di saluran air ini
5950950 aduh maaf kang rumah saya bocor jadi tadi saya membenarkan atap rumah saya dulu
5950951 eeuuhhh teu nanaon atuh kalau si parto ke mana jun naha belum nongol juga
5950952 wah duka atuh kang saya tadi langsung ke sini setelah membenarkan atap yang bocor saya teringat janji sama akang makanya saya langsung ke sini biarlah kang kalau si parto ingat pada janji dia juga akan datang ke sini untuk sama sama membersihkan saluran air
5950953 nya akang mah disebutnya teh baru kali ini padahal sudah sering kan saya cageur teh
5950954 iya iya jun akang atuh kamu semakin sadar coba kalau semua urang lembur kita teh salaladar seperti kamu wah dijamin kampung kita bakal bermartabat bersih makmur taat dan bersahabat tidak buang sampah seenaknya mau menjaga kelestarian lingkungan saling menghargai
5950955 sebentar sebentar kang yang diomongin akang teh sebenarnya mah gampang dilaksanakan tapi gampang juga dilanggar
5950956 iya kang yang begitu mah gampang gampang susah misalnya kita lihat tuh di televisi ada pemain sepak bola yang meludahi pemain lainnya hanya sebatas meludah nilai bermartabat itu hilang kang
5950957 ih pan iya kang dari sisi kebersihan meludah di sembarang tempat saja sudah jadi kelakuan yang tidak bersih tambah lagi meludahi pemain lain waaahhhh itu mah bukan tidak bersahabat lagi itu mah sudah tidak profesional tidak ada rasa menghargai sesama pemain
5950958 bukan hanya pemain persib kang ada beberapa pemain lagi yang bertingkah laku sama terus kelakuan mereka itu ditayangkan televisi dan lihiat banyak anak di seluruh indonesia
5950959 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
5950960 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
5950961 ich m chte jemanden der integrit t besitzt der aus den richtigen gr nden in der politik ist
5950962 ich m chte jemanden der unabh ngig ist jemanden der mir sagen kann wissen sie mr president ich glaube sie haben unrecht und ich sage ihnen warum
5950963 the reason we came about is because of the access to health care issue they are looking for alternatives to access health care
5950964 all providers play a role in the maintenance of the health of a community and individuals
5950965 the key is continuity of the care if an individual chooses to use a retail based health outlet then the responsibility of assuring their health record is complete falls on the individual
5950966 they have been present throughout the country they are obviously responding to a perceived need in the community
5950967 i think anything that improves access for patients is good i have a couple of caveats when patients go to an urgent care center i appreciate getting a record back i think continuity of care is very important communicating back with the primary care doctors is in everyones best interest
5950968 its a very reasonable way to address the needs of patients
5950969 the american academy of pediatrics opposes retail based clinics as an appropriate source of medical care for infants children and adolescents and strongly discourages their use as the aap is committed to the medical home model the medical home model provides accessible family centered comprehensive continuous coordinated compassionate and culturally effective care for which the pediatrician and family share responsibility
5950970 we have plenty of places for people to get care
5950971 i would find a doctor who can provide you with a good medical home
5950972 we specialize in the treatment of children its a whole different level of service youre getting
5950973 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
5950974 we did establish a fixed date for the next election
5950975 the fact of the matter what we will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament
5950976 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important
5950977 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
5950978 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5950979 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
5950980 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5950981 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5950982 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5950983 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5950984 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5950985 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5950986 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5950987 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5950988 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5950989 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5950990 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5950991 my whole career has been about resolving access issues this is my battle horse
5950992 private delivery is an accepted practice everywhere in the world and its time canada accepted this reality
5950993 ive never hidden what i do im not ashamed of it in fact im quite proud
5950994 and let me remind you that the people who elected me know what i think and what i stand for
5950995 darth vader was actually a good guy he went from the dark side to the good side

5950998 rather than wait six months for a scan at a hospital we provided them in a couple of days
5950999 im not touting privatization of the whole health system nobody wants an american style health system least of all the cma

5951014 you can imagine a person being able to go from point a to point b in all kinds of crazy ways but people mostly choose to walk
5951015 walking is the least energy consuming at slow speeds and running is the least energy consuming at fast speeds
5951016 so walkings the gait that people use where theres at least one foot on the ground where your body moves approximately in a sequence of circular arcs
5951017 and as far as we can tell this thing looks would look something like a tired run something like like that

5951021 my microcontroller can beat the hell out of your microcontroller
5951022 so weve gone from maybe one fifth or one sixth of the worlds population participating to where we now have a huge pool of people in the olympic games
5951023 at some level weve reached a physiological plateau in general the champions of today dont have dramatically better treadmill times as compared to elite athletes of earlier generations what i think we are seeing is a small effect due to better racetracks shoes and improved sports medicine and people are participating longer so you have more competitive depth which leads to better races and races designed to set world records
5951024 the lactate threshold is highly related to how people perform in an event like the 10 000 meter race marathons or a bicycle time trial the physiology and biochemistry behind it is complex and controversial but its a good marker of when the regulatory and physiological control systems of the body are in balance
5951025 the first misperception is that somehow people dont have enough oxygen when they are making lactic acid that certainly can be true because lactic acid can come from a lack of oxygen but under most circumstances the athletes have plenty of oxygen and there is plenty of oxygen in the muscle
5951026 the second misnomer is that lactic acid hangs around in your muscle for long periods of time you may hear things like this individual is sore or not performing as well today because they have a lot of lactic acid in their muscle from yesterdays event well you can have very high levels of lactic acid in muscle but its gone 15 to 30 minutes after exercise so lactic acid doesnt hang around a long time
5951027 breathing oxygen on the sidelines really doesnt help theres no evidence that it works
5951028 they all have big engines and high lactate thresholds because theyve been training hard for a long time their muscles have adapted to run very fast without releasing a lot of lactic acid
5951029 in cycling for example when lance armstrong came back from cancer he became much more efficient he could generate more power per given oxygen update that is the same as a runner being able to generate more speed per given power when you look at this small pool of elite athletes of runners cyclists and rowers all of them have a high vo2 all have a large engine and all of them have skeletal muscles that are designed not to produce a lot of lactic acid so the question then becomes who is the most efficient
5951030 your vo2 max typically starts to decline in your 30s but a highly trained athlete can delay that decline until they are in their later 30s or even early 40s an average sedentary person loses about 10 percent per decade starting at about age 30 but for someone who is able to continue to train very hard into their 40s and 50s they only lose about half that much primarily due to the fact they continue to train hard
5951031 as scientists search for genes and the determinants of performance they keep drawing a blank there have been no major gene discoveries saying that this gene really confers championship status or the potential for championship status of one person
5951032 it can be very deceptive to say that since the kenyans and perhaps ethiopians are dominating distance running it must be genetic in fact there have been periods of time when other cultures have dominated distance running before world war ii the finns dominated distance running after world war ii the eastern europeans dominated distance running they were just as dominant as the kenyans are now
5951033 i think what the kenyans and ethiopians have shown is the value of altitude training they are physically active their entire lives they live at high altitude they run to and from school they play soccer after school all at high altitude 6 000 to 8 000 feet there are not a lot of economic opportunities so there is a tremendous incentive for people to run and train hard
5951034 so what the kenyans have added is altitude training hard training and large numbers of highly motivated people but their physiological data is not dramatically different from other people i think you can make the same argument for the eastern europeans after world war ii if you were a pretty good athlete the government offered you and your family incentives to train in an otherwise bleak economic landscape
5951035 one of the sad things in last 30 to 40 years of sport has been the emergence of the pharmacological arms race or doping
5951036 researchers have started to test the tests and have raised questions about the accuracy of the existing tests theyve shown that if you dont do the test soon after people take the drug it may be very difficult to detect especially if epo is take in low doses
5951037 remember while its fun to watch sports and while we will all be tempted to sit in front of the tv to watch the olympics the really important thing is to get out and move one hundred and fifty minutes of physical activity a week is really the most powerful medicine anybody can prescribe no matter what your level of fitness even if its just walking try to be as physically active as you possibly can because thats the way to be a healthy old person and get more out of life
5951038 exercise may still be beneficial for patients being treated for an anxiety or depressive disorder
5951039 but we couldnt find evidence for a causal effect in the population at large
5951040 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to us 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself

5951062 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen

5951066 he used to say that excerpting was the true editors art

5951068 he had a wide idea of what good fiction was and when i got involved with him it seemed like a huge stroke of good luck

5951077 the worst injury john mccain suffered in the war was tennis elbow
5951078 colonel hogan proved this and thats the reason that the government had him killed but the truth must out so were doing our part to let people know what kind of vile man john mccain really is
5951079 he caught bird flu at a chicken orgy and was convicted six times of public indecency with farm animals
5951080 john mccain needs to come clean with the american people and prove that he didnt actually spend those years in captivity in hawaii and that theres no gigantic secret conspiracy that has destroyed every shred of evidence to the contrary if he cant do that then hes not fit to lead this country
5951081 answer them fully and completely with corroborating evidence and faultless timelines so we can focus on debating the future of this nation

5951100 ill just try to be a teammate and do what i can to try to support guys the coaching staff is usually good at teaching ill just stay out of their way and let the coaches coach
5951101 there are several possibilities none of whom have finally said yes i can do it given their work commitments and were hoping one will eventually emerge and the board will agree
5951102 i would have roger at no 1 however the board made the decision that it was better to have roger at no 3 and make it clear that he was coming to parliament rather than create a controversy over his list position
5951103 while people want a change of government i think theres a significant number of people who want a change of direction as well

5951111 having people who are close to the leadership of campaigns can give important insights to where the country might be in three to five years
5951112 thats positive however when the board meets they ensure that strategies are in place to create value i have never personally witnessed a substantive political discussion
5951113 ive seen republican board members push environmental education and medical issues ive seen democrats on boards who will pursue whats best for the company from a tax standpoint
5951114 they had a lot of respect for romney and some contributed to his campaign when he ran for president
5951115 i wont vote for obama but im not sure what ill do
5951116 he was just waking up to the thought that women around the country were upset over the treatment of hillary
5951117 it is in the best interests of the soviet union and its relations with other countries if a constitutional government is promptly put back into operation
5951118 we are committed to democratic reform and to constitutional government there
5951119 and that means that mr gorbachev who was constitutionally installed is in our view in power
5951120 whats called for here is commitment to principle backing those people who ware committed to reform backing the people in the soviet union and in the republics
5951121 all constitutionally elected leaders and oppose the use of force especially in the baltic states
5951122 we have no interest in a new cold war or in the exacerbation of east west tensions
5951123 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
5951124 i always speak with my staff and ask different questions
5951125 i had a chat with stuart pearce and ray clemence because i prefer to see both sides of everything
5951126 i could only choose once i knew all the players so it was very important to let people try
5951127 one player might be good another might be not so good i had to look for myself
5951128 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
5951129 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
5951130 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
5951131 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that
5951132 were quite confident theres no hendra virus left on the property but we still need to do a bit more testing on the samples weve previously collected there as well we have collected some more samples just to clarify some issues there

5951134 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5951135 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit
5951136 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
5951137 i have a squad and all the players are important tomorrow i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers
5951138 what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality
5951139 this is very important for me i want to see this i want to see another step forward
5951140 in the short of space weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

5951154 its good for us its good for bethany and its good for the valley
5951155 parents students and consumers look at the criteria to make the most important decision of their life where they will go to school
5951156 ainsi quinga me lavait un jour fait remarquer depuis platon la philosophie et la culture occidentale ont un c t oculaire la vue est notre sens dominant nous nous d chiffrons mutuellement laide de nos yeux extension anatomique de notre cerveau quand nous regardons quelquun dans les yeux cest dans un cerveau que nous regardons un individu sans yeux est perturbant pour la simple raison que les yeux sont les portes de la personne
5951157 all the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls
5951158 ive been watching for seven straight hours and there hasnt been a damn thing on
5951159 its important that we do play the game as we have everything set out

5951161 no matter where the game is played its important for the group that it went ahead
5951162 if services are disrupted customers should seek alternative routes if they normally use the jubilee northern and piccadilly lines we expect to operate normal services on the rest of the network
5951163 the reality is that tubelines already pays rates lower than metronet and offers inferior pensions and travel facilities and the reason our members voted by a margin of more than three to one to strike is because what is on the table will widen that gap
5951164 if you are a factory owner here its not like youre being kicked around somebody has hit you over the head with a baseball bat
5951165 youve got a drop in demand business stinks at the same time prices are going up
5951166 we expect that in the next three years one third of guangdongs manufacturing export factories will be closed down
5951167 the entire world had the impression that the happy party of very cheap chinese goods could last forever
5951168 i thought that but i think perhaps its coming to an end
5951169 the days of cheap labor have gone no cheap labor ok
5951170 with constantly rising prices we have to raise our quotes to survive american consumers will have to pay higher prices

5951179 it happens in every business you cant hold these young kids back
5951180 the fans will see players come and go within mls all the time it happens in every team
5951181 when you have that sort of money sitting on the table its difficult to hold a young kid like that back
5951182 we are extremely pleased and honored to be selected as one of the top 100 colleges in the nation by such a prestigious publication
5951183 this marks the third time in the past month that bethany has been recognized on a national or regional list of top colleges thats a great validation of our previous efforts and a wonderful inspiration for the future as we eagerly move forward to meet the challenges of our rapidly changing world and work force in the 21st century

5951185 parents students and consumers look at the criteria to make the most important decision of their life where they will go to school
5951186 hmm its big and karen would get quite frightened if she saw it

5951188 we fully agree with carol diamond and clay shirky that deployment of health information technology it is necessary but not sufficient for transforming u
5951189 doctors and health insurers are taking issue with the governments proposed schedule for converting to a new system for coding diagnoses and treatments representatives of the medical group management association mgma the american medical association and americas health insurance plans ahip said today that the three year transition the health and human services department has proposed for transitioning from international classification of diseases version 9 to icd 10 is not long enough
5951190 one of the biggest obstacles to expanding the use of information technology it in health care may be the current narrow focus on how to stimulate its adoption

5951197 el gobierno ruso tiene la intenci n de llevar una flota al caribe la flota rusa ser bienvenida en las aguas venezolanas
5951198 the whole goal is a lot different than it has been
5951199 it had a bad reputation before so we had to look at every aspect and evaluate how to move it forward
5951200 its not about northgate music festival in general its about the revitalization of a local music scene
5951201 weve been on blogs message boards and facebook asking people who their favorite bands were
5951202 whats crazy is i had never heard of them somebody on the boards said what about daes vail after we took a listen we got in touch with them and managed to book them
5951203 i really feel that 15 is worth it for saturdays main stage alone
5951204 the mindset has switched from just trying to sell tickets to actually wanting the local music culture to grow
5951205 we want people to realize its not about making money
5951206 our motto is building champions and obviously a big part of creating a contender is creating a home field advantage and i think the 12th man is the best in the country
5951207 we want to have everyone that wants to see the games be able to see them but we do want it to be a hot ticket we want them to be in demand which is why we have the pull and now the lottery for basketball
5951208 but i think the pulling process is very straightforward especially the different days for different classes
5951209 i think the ticket pull is the fairest and best way to determine seating assignments
5951210 students who have put in the work should be given the best available seats
5951211 friends are so important they really help to create a balance in life especially the stressful life of a college student
5951212 it is a growing and changing process that is very natural and not without its stress
5951213 often students are confronted with different beliefs values and lifestyles than they have encountered before that alone can be very stressful
5951214 once you get to college you start losing contact with the majority of people from high school
5951215 you really learn who your friends are the great thing about a amp m is that if you have a positive attitude toward people they will usually be very friendly
5951216 build time into your calendar to take care of yourself and understand that everything is going to take three times longer than you think its going to its also really important to not get isolated remember to stay connected to groups and things you enjoy
5951217 my first year was really fun and i made new friends from all over but if i could go back i probably would have studied more
5951218 my advice for incoming freshmen would be to budget time so that you have enough for both schoolwork and friends
5951219 on the down side they are loaded with sexual predators on the plus side they are also loaded with sexual prey
5951220 duct tape is a very important tool and also a very educational tool
5951221 the best thing about duct tape is its versatility youre only limited in uses by what you can dream up and put together
5951222 i love duct tape its on my crutches right now
5951223 its holding on the pillows so the crutches dont hurt my armpits as bad
5951224 i had an ac runoff valve in my shower at my dorm and the water coming out of it is was freezing so a shower was torture
5951225 so i used duct tape to funnel the water down the wall and into the drain
5951226 i personally have had a few warts that i would just put duct tape on every night before going to bed and they would actually go away after a week or two
5951227 hmm that slab looks particularly soft and cozy and amazing
5951228 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car
5951229 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5951230 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5951231 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5951232 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option

5951260 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5951261 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5951262 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5951263 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington

5951385 both diesel and fertiliser are among our major resources for farming just like electricity
5951386 it is therefore our concern that the prices of fertiliser and diesel have risen three fold this means that our farmers will not be in a position to produce as much crop to feed the nation as they did last season 2007 08
5951387 with these subsidies the number of our vulnerable but viable farmers benefiting from this programme will increase from 125 000 in 2007 to 200 000 next season
5951388 whereas we appreciate the governments decision to provide more fertiliser under the support programme there are still many many small scale farmers who will not benefit from the programme this is why we are now encouraging our farmers to go for conservation farming as the best practice at the moment
5951389 as znfu we have conclusively proved that conservation farming can produce wonders if we can produce at least 2 5 tonnes per hectare then we would be feeding the whole region and conservation farming is able to guarantee that at national level we are currently producing 1 3 tonnes per hectare

5951411 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car
5951412 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5951413 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5951414 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5951415 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option

5951459 an incredible impossible mad place i tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and i have lived and worked in it is part of our dream world
5951460 even the gnarled stones seemed alive on that mystical island skelligs monks must have communed with angels for their daily sustenance on such bare rock
5951461 as i climbed the path winding up to the ancient constructions near the top of skelligs cliff i sensed that i was on the threshold of something utterly unique though i was by no means a stranger to monasteries which i had visited throughout europe and even farther afield at one time and another but nothing in my experience had prepared me for this huddle of domes crouching halfway to heaven in this all but inaccessible place with an intimidating immensity of space all around where it was easy to feel that you had reached a limit of this world a holy place to be sure which would still have been holy even if it had never known the consecrated life of prayer

5951471 one of the biggest obstacles to expanding the use of information technology it in health care may be the current narrow focus on how to stimulate its adoption
5951472 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have

5951484 i only regret that i have but one life to lose for my country
5951485 i would loved to have done both but i was told that wasnt going to be possible i had done the footy for such a long time and had given it my all i wanted a new challenge and to do something different
5951486 this is my opportunity to make it happen in an individual sport i will know if i dont win a medal then its down to me and not the team
5951487 it was great scoring the winning goal in that game
5951488 we had been two goals up before france pulled one back late in the game
5951489 it was a bit of a panic for the last five minutes but we hung on and we deserved it it finished on a high for me and for the team
5951490 however at that stage i still didnt know if i had qualified for the judo in beijing i thought i had done enough but wasnt sure so i was playing in the europeans knowing it might be my last competition and i was concentrating on keeping focus and giving it my best
5951491 i thought i had a bad tournament at the world championships in argentina in 2006 so i was desperate to go out on a high and i trained really hard to make sure that could happen
5951492 my aim is to do my best i havent set myself any target above that
5951493 ive been training well and really hard and i feel i havent left any stone unturned im trying not to put too much pressure on myself and ill go out there and do my best i will hopefully get a medal but what will be will be

5951505 the house was just packed and crowded and we were all so happy and it was so exciting to feel this energy and the power of the forces at work
5951506 im not going to tell you whether ive asked mr bachchan to shave off his beard or not but for sure this is going to be his most startling makeover in recent times balakrishna who is also known as balki told ians
5951507 while abhishek will be given a more intrinsic personality change im totally changing mr bachchans look
5951508 pa would be a far more emotional story than cheeni kum which was far more caustic dry and sharp tongued
5951509 actually cheeni kum was inspired by one scene in raj khoslas dostana where mr bachchan had confronted zeenat aman the look of utter disdain and sarcasm in his eyes remained with me thats how his character in cheeni kum was born
5951510 while in cheeni kum he was a character i had seen earlier in pa hes a totally different person it a very emotional father son story but the emotions wont be melodramatic
5951511 amitji will have no love interest his world revolves around his son will i borrow from mr bachchans real life relationship with abhishek no in fact i know them so well that ill make sure i avoid all references to their real life
5951512 ah ilayaraja again i worship the man and the cinematography will be by none other than p c sreeram again after cheeni kum

5951515 we were trying to help this kid with his conduct out there
5951516 it didnt work out hes not a bad kid but he needs to channel his aggression in a positive manner
5951517 i dont like to talk about it because its still upsetting to me
5951518 im not the person the coaches have made me out to be im just someone who plays baseball hard i tried to explain that to them before they released me i played that way the whole time i played for them in my whole career with the reds
5951519 for what its worth the reds did a lot for me and im grateful
5951520 but getting released probably has been one of the best things to happen to me in baseball ive moved up a level and im getting the chance to play right off the bat
5951521 ive had a lot of stuff going through my mind these last three weeks my aunt is one of the people i listen to the most and she told me that when one door closes another one opens and thats what happened here
5951522 ive fit in pretty good with these guys and i just want to bring as much energy to this team as i can
5951523 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
5951524 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
5951525 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
5951526 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5951527 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5951528 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5951529 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
5951530 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
5951531 at this point were focused on building our organic strategy
5951532 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
5951533 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5951534 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5951535 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5951536 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on google
5951537 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential

5951545 ive always wanted to travel and always wanted to help people
5951546 i care about people and realise that compassion is often in short supply in busy lifestyles my travelling to conferences and interaction with a wide group of people have taught me to appreciate how big the world is and how unique each individuals life is
5951547 i always had this image in my mind but kept it quiet because i thought people would laugh at me
5951548 we wont raise as much as we would have liked but my main goal was always to talk in schools
5951549 what ever money raised is a bonus for the ted noff foundation

5951551 they liked what they saw and asked us to come
5951552 our election was very good everyone had their paper work in on time
5951553 i told him about the delays caused by the trains
5951554 he thought it would be good if people here knew when the trains were coming so they can time it
5951555 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention center

5951587 its hard work we work long hours but when you cant be a professional in the sport yourself i guess this is the next best thing
5951588 in 2002 when he was 15 years old he won the world junior championships he raced more at 200 metres prior to this this year he got strong enough hes been in the gym a little bit more and hes been quite successful
5951589 hes a typical jamaican i think very laid back very very laid back in the warm up area before the 100 metres we were punching each other rolling on the ground he was laughing he loves playing games hes a young at heart kind of guy

5951616 me encantei muito mais pela m sica barroca do que pelo instrumento em si no meu caso o cravo que tem um mecanismo muito dif cil possui um controle digital muito fino e n o responde de acordo com o peso que voc aplica sobre as teclas como no piano
5951617 o nosso desafio reconstruir a m sica feita nos s culos 17 e 18 partindo de documentos hist ricos plantas de instrumentos com medidas certas interpreta es sobre os contextos em que os compositores viveram mas nunca vamos saber se soamos como antigamente temos a viv ncia do s culo 20 21
5951618 n o queremos s ser macaquinhos de repeti o do que est ali impresso na partitura nos preocupamos em pesquisar tudo o que estava por tr s daquelas m sicas
5951619 quanto mais nos esfor amos para compreender e apreender esta m sica mais percebemos quanto ela ultrapassa a beleza e quanto ela nos perturba e nos inquieta pela diversidade de sua linguagem

5951626 given the year its been and how much effort hes put in to try to get himself right i dont think its really a surprise
5951627 i think weve kind of been conditioning ourselves to be prepared to go on should he not be able to pitch
5951628 the likelihood of this being season ending is probably very real
5951629 what hes got to do is not make any kind of decision where emotions are involved with an arm problem
5951630 he showed this spring that his body is still strong
5951631 well wait a while and see what he wants to do
5951632 my heart goes out to him ive had times like that myself
5951633 i just hope hell be all right and i hope hell still be around

5951643 the conventional wisdom is that this election is going to be a referendum on barack obama
5951644 his people are smart enough to realize this doesnt necessarily work to their benefit
5951645 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
5951646 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
5951647 its revealing that barack obama attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
5951648 what sen obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice
5951649 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
5951650 youre taking the most active people in a national political party and putting them all under one roof which creates the potential for a lot of volatility
5951651 with 15 000 journalists on hand if anything goes wrong its going to be hugely amplified
5951652 can you turn the four days of the convention into a 10 or 12 day story
5951653 he can adjust his final decision based on the obama ticket

5951658 hoje as hortas est o abandonadas foi um trabalho perdido
5951659 o projeto ficou parado com a mudan a do governo n o teve como oficializar a gera o de renda e quando assumi as hortas j tinham minguado
5951660 eram coletores de recicl veis que ganhavam r 60 e hoje t m um sal rio de r 280 importante recuperar espa os degradados e ressocializar as pessoas
5951661 estamos muito ocupados providenciando a realiza o dos espet culos agendados em outras casas mas temos certeza de que vamos reconstruir e j vamos come ar a planejar na pr xima semana
5951662 tudo vai depender do ritmo de arrecada o de fundos mas precisamos pelos menos de uns seis meses para elaborar o projeto e ent o come ar as obras

5951779 north carolina man dies after waiting 22 hours at hospital
5951780 investor interest in properties owned by banks or other mortgage lenders as a result of foreclosure is the highest i have seen during my career in residential real estate
5951781 the number of foreclosures in our area is much less than in some places across the nation such as california florida and nevada but the level of foreclosure activity here is still quite high by historic standards
5951782 some banks are willing to take as much as a 60 percent loss on a home and in fact we sold one recently in which the bank recovered only 47 percent of its outstanding mortgage debt on the property
5951783 banks want to move these properties and once a home has passed through the foreclosure process buying can be a relatively straightforward process
5951784 most investors we see rehab the property and resell it rather than use it to generate rental income
5951785 banks generally wont do any repairs on foreclosed homes they are selling other than a few inexpensive cosmetic items its the buyer who has to fix any serious problems to pass the inspection
5951786 investors typically have the resources needed to do that which gives them an advantage those seeking a home to live in often dont have the necessary cash on hand to finance repairs
5951787 they want a home in good shape and they want to get a great deal but homes with only minor condition problems are going to be priced closer to market value
5951788 banks want these homes sold because they are expensive to hold so they tell their real estate agents to price a home to sell in 30 to 90 days even then the prices are negotiable
5951789 some lenders are more flexible than others and the amount of time a home sits on the market also has an impact
5951790 the longer a home is listed for sale the more the bank is willing to negotiate after 150 days a property is considered aged and lenders will be very aggressive on the pricing
5951791 the homes can be inspected and offers are made using a standard contract form however if a lender likes the offer the contract will be sent back with a lengthy addendum for the buyer to sign
5951792 with the contract we use the buyer still has five days to inspect the home and walk away but the bank is unlikely to extend the inspection period at the buyers request
5951793 often buyers expect the bank that is selling the property to provide the financing but that just isnt happening now
5951794 the longer a foreclosed property stands empty the more likely it is to have condition issues
5951795 one way to get a good estimate is to call the utility company and find out when the prior resident turned off the gas and electricity
5951796 whether they are an investor or a would be resident of the home buyers need to know what they are getting into as far as cost goes the financing is generally available either with an fha loan or a rehab loan the other key is to have an experienced attorney review all the documents that come from the bank so that you know what you are signing
5951797 but its also true for others it can even make sense to have an appraiser evaluate the property so you know what has to be done to it to maximize its market value
5951798 its not just one of those cult sports anymore its really become mainstream
5951799 we are passionate about mixed martial arts and are excited to share it with everyone interested in its explosive growth

5951801 while faith and its effects can be found throughout pop culture rarely does a film address it so directly and in such an engaging way as in henry poole is here we believe that its treatment of faith will generate dialogue especially among the young adults that theology on tap touches through its many events

5951804 fair and lovely cream is racist but i still use it
5951805 exacerbate and capitalise on the kind of racism which privileges lighter skin over darker
5951806 if the products themselves arent banned any form of advertising for them should be they are clearly racist adverts
5951807 the desire to change modify skin tone is universal depending on the notion of beauty prevalent in a particular society this may be manifested either as lightening or darkening the existing skin tone this desire cuts across cultures income levels educational levels and gender
5951808 given the above there is nothing to suggest that the marketing of fair and lovely or its position of skin lightening is therefore imperialist racist or exploitative
5951809 i love you despite the fact that you have olive skin
5951810 if used incorrectly the creams can cause skin conditions that take a very long time to treat
5951811 some of these creams are very cheap they are found everywhere and are very easy to buy
5951812 the problem is young girls want to use them all the time which is very dangerous

5951816 blowing up things can be attractive and so with reunion arena going down and now with texas stadium going down i would like to see us take advantage of both of those
5951817 it would be expensive for a studio to go out and buy a stadium or an arena to blow up but if we have to have one that needs to go away anyway then its advantageous to both sides
5951818 i think if you can turn it into something useful that would be a good idea
5951819 if youre going to tear it down why not blow it up for a movie
5951820 i mean theyve made a lot of amazing plays there and i dont know if that would be right to just blow it up
5951821 we would like to immortalize reunion arena and texas stadium in film even if it is in their outgoing glory
5951822 theres something to be said for that because they are going away anyway so lets take the best advantage we can of it

5951834 the massive global demand channeled through a single web marketplace will justify entrepreneurial investment in the huge volume high quality low cost supply side to begin with
5951835 you know buying a toilet is so time consuming taking away from my busy day of walking several miles for buckets of clean water if only there were some kind of web site i could log onto order the toilet and then be on my way to the next town for my turn at the water pump

5951837 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace

5951846 i think if im here two weeks from now theyre going to release me
5951847 other than that if i get traded before then then i get traded
5951848 but if it comes down to the last cut and im still here theyre going to release me i dont think theres any doubt about that
5951849 you kind of want to keep things safe every now and then too i couldnt really see the defensive back
5951850 i wanted to keep it low and away in case the d b was going to try to undercut him either my guy was going to catch it or nobody was going to catch it
5951851 for the most part i thought i did ok there were a few things here and there that i would have done differently
5951852 im not one to read the newspaper and i dont even look at the internet
5951853 i just try to go by what people tell me
5951854 im just trying to get myself back to where i want to be and get to being a quarterback again

5951858 it was under british rule that champs a championship for the countrys top high school runners was founded in 1910 it has developed into jamaicas biggest annual sporting event attracting up to 2 000 athletes and daily sell out crowds every year of 30 000 it is the tip of a competition pyramid that sees children across jamaica start to take part in sprint races from the age of five wherever you find a piece of wasteland on the island you will inevitably see youngsters arranging impromptu races dreaming one day of making it to champs every great jamaican sprinter appears on the champs honours list for decades the event was also a fertile hunting ground for united states universities who armed with lucrative scholarships lured the best teenagers but they were often burnt out by coaches determined to get their moneys worth and so failed to fulfil their potential the difference now is that if you are as talented as bolt it is possible to stay on the island to train and travel to europe to compete in the top meetings where you can easily earn more than a million dollars a year by staying to work with their respective coaches glen mills and stephen francis bolt and his compatriot former world record holder asafa powell have encouraged others to remain and that has helped raise the standard

5951884 viviamo insieme da secoli lamerica che viene a confondere tutto
5951885 non vogliamo che bombardiate qui come avete fatto in jugoslavia ed in iraq uno spazio nostro
5951886 che un uomo istruito e riflessivo vuole la pace non imporre la democrazia con baionette come bush e saakach

5951894 on saturday in a national radio address speaker pelosi went on
5951895 the american people should hold pelosi to this commitment and demand that congress immediately return to washington d c and vote
5951896 and when congress votes there must be a full and fair debate that allows the republican minority the opportunity to debate and vote on the american energy act an all of the above approach to energy legislation that encompasses more drilling more use of clean energy sources and more conservation
5951897 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance

5951900 i dont think there is anyone i want to negatively accost at the festival
5951901 i suppose i would throw a pint of beer over pete doherty if he is there if being the word as we just played an austrian festival and babyshambles were meant to be playing two bands after us and guess what he didnt turn up
5951902 i dont know how he gets his head through the holes in his t shirts because theyre really tight

5951907 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
5951908 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
5951909 politics of the 50s and 60s will not work today
5951910 obvious reasons this is something we who feed from the alternative media must learn to accept but only after the 26th
5951911 o god we acknowledge you today as lord not only of individuals but also of nations and governments we thank you for the graces you have given us to exerise our political charity in malaysia we also thank you for the opportunities of free choice offered to the people of the constituency of permatang pauh for electing a leader lord god give them the courage to exercise their solemn duty as citizens of malaysia to vote ob behalf of the whole nation guide those voters with the wisdom of the holy spirit so that they may choose a suitable and trustworthy candidate to become the next member of parliament for permatang pauh we ask this through jesus christ our lord amen
5951912 sends a clear message that current western strategy in afghanistan is failing
5951913 until now western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan and their ability to move swiftly on the afghan capital
5951914 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
5951915 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
5951916 dick cheney is back in a very uncomfortable place for him the headlines
5951917 the beijing games look set to become the biggest broadcasted event in olympic history
5951918 that had an audience of 40 million in the united states
5951919 my book is a respectful portrayal of islam of aisha of muhammad and anyone who reads it with an open mind will come away with an understanding of islam as a peaceful religion
5951920 we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions
5951921 im going to tell you there are no terrorist threats against random house there was never received any terrorist threat
5951922 by saying that muslims will be violent that they cant intelligently discuss this book its disrespectful to muslims
5951923 to me it feels racist for them to say that someone will try to attack them that someone will try to go after me
5951924 this is one of the most despicable episodes of appeasement
5951925 you can intimidate publishing and media to not publish anything critical about islam and just by an indirect threat of not being happy about it
5951926 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
5951927 ive not contradicted koran i just said gee what if this happened i wanted to show aishas maturation
5951928 what you have then is a clearly controversial highly emotional writing the author has taken liberties with historical framework she tried to present a historical novel but its a harlequin thing
5951929 denises position is that the manuscript takes liberties and is historically inaccurate
5951930 its just surreal that this book is being debated around the world and it hasnt even been published
5951931 i was never angry at random house but i was bitterly disappointed because i thought they were wrong
5951932 zoveel geld meneer mevrouw dat kan natuurlijk niet iedereen zich veroorloven bent u niet bang dat uw kind nooit met kinderen uit andere bevolkingsgroepen in contact zal komen
5951933 nu zullen ze deze in onze woonomgeving toch niet zo gauw treffen dus dat verandert de situatie niet zo erg
5951934 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
5951935 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
5951936 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
5951937 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
5951938 le pedimos a usted y a su equipo que parte de ese sagrado d a realicen servicio a la comunidad honrando el esp ritu de unidad que uni a nuestra naci n en el periodo inmediatamente posterior a los ataques terroristas

5951941 blut ist ein bestandteil von resident evil 5 und wird nicht entfernt
5951942 wir werden kein blut freies resident evil produzieren nur um eine niedrigere einstufung zu erreichen da es ein horror spiel ist und gewalt effekte sind ein teil davon
5951943 wie wir mit resident evil 4 wii gezeigt haben gibt es nach wie vor einen markt f r erwachsene titel auch auf diesen plattformen
5951944 es gibt keinen grund warum ein angemessener titel f r erwachsene nicht produziert werden sollte was ich sehe ist dass publisher sich von titeln wegbewegen die ausschlie lich erwachsene themen behandeln und die lediglich schockieren wollen

5951955 canada has always had a really good history in mountain biking
5951956 we maybe dont have the depth but the riders that we do bring to international competition are usually in the running
5951957 there is a strong connection to mountain biking in our culture much more than say track or road especially where these riders are from in the mountains it is the culture there

5951964 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
5951965 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
5951966 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
5951967 i didnt really care how the scores went up what the placements were
5951968 for some reason the judges were not giving me the scores i was used to
5951969 those silvers mean more to me than anything else could everything thats happened this week i dont know how to explain it but its a feeling id never want to replace
5951970 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5951971 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5951972 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5951973 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5951974 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5951975 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5951976 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5951977 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5951978 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5951979 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5951980 i think every time we play from here on out like coach says its going to like a game 7 in the playoffs
5951981 such advice may be obtained from a competent attorney accountant financial adviser
5951982 1 the reaganites swept into power on the arguments of economic conservatives tight money their views were tried and failed completely they have no remaining defenders in academia
5951983 paul volcker a democrat 3 was appointed chairman of the federal reserve in august 1979 by president jimmy carter and reappointed in 1983 by president ronald reagan
5951984 not to sound cocky but everythings kind of coming naturally everything feels good so hopefully tomorrow will be the same i felt good and hopefully i made a statement today

5951986 you take a look around and see what it all is and get a little perspective
5951987 itd be awesome if kobe comes out the whole experience has been so overwhelming
5951988 this is a once in a lifetime thing and i find that the more experiences you take in the better you are as a person
5951989 you cant miss the games we saw the 100 meters how unreal is that fastest man alive
5951990 just the fact that other athletes are talking about it and theyre like thats the most exciting thing
5951991 a lot of people are talking about it people recognize me in the village im like wow thats kind of weird
5951992 after that first lap there was nothing to lose i either did it or didnt do it
5951993 ive cried a bunch because of how much this means to me its not preparing anymore its here im here to do it either greatness is going to happen or its back to normal life
5951994 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information dr elliot said
5951995 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5951996 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5951998 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
5951999 most of the stuff tries to sweep variability under the map
5952000 what you see published are composite pictures the averages of three or four people if you look at the data from the same trial you see a tremendous amount of variability the field hasnt dealt with that and they know it
5952001 but eventually theyll turn around they have to for clinical use
5952002 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5952003 your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5952004 they are choosing individuals who would have evidence for good development which means that maybe their offspring would be more healthy and have good development as well

5952007 i see more cranes in the sky in austin right now than i do in new orleans
5952008 i would say this to the president that i evacuated and went to beaumont and then to austin but i returned home to new orleans because i believed the promises he made from jackson square
5952009 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives
5952010 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5952011 postoperative ileus remains the single greatest barrier to hospital discharge in otherwise uncomplicated colorectal surgery
5952012 if this relatively easy safe and cheap intervention can help it is certainly something worth trying
5952013 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of hospital stay
5952014 this doesnt mean that if you give someone chewing gum they will just jump out of bed and feel good enough to go home
5952015 it is very unusual for the royal albert hall to have to request police assistance which on that occasion they did
5952016 he doherty just whipped up the crowd and there was disorder
5952017 we are not killjoys and we help organisers with many events throughout the year and some are much larger than this one
5952018 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
5952019 what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
5952020 they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting

5952038 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5952039 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5952040 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5952041 the government picks health plans then we have to pick a plan from their list
5952042 our community believes its very important to move on an agenda of health care reform
5952043 i think it shows that the american people are coming together
5952044 those who were opposed to health care reform in the past now know its critically important
5952045 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5952046 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions

5952049 un acto p blico de reconocimiento de responsabilidad internacional es una medida de reparaci n que la corte usualmente ordena por otra parte al ordenar esta medida de reparaci n el tribunal tom en cuenta que el estado reconoci su responsabilidad internacional por los hechos ocurridos en el penal miguel castro castro durante la tramitaci n del presente caso por ello en los t rminos del reconocimiento de responsabilidad internacional efectuado ante esta corte el estado debe realizar dicho reconocimiento ahora en su jurisdicci n interna

5952083 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
5952084 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
5952085 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5952086 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
5952087 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
5952088 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
5952089 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5952090 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5952091 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5952092 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5952093 salvator told dianna his black shoes are underneath the sink and he asked her to wash them real good and to throw them real far away
5952094 it remains our position that we have not done anything wrong and nothing illegal but it puts us in a position that would make it impossible for us to continue
5952095 it bears on you but its best to do it and do it right
5952096 i dont care if it takes 10 years and 10 more delays
5952097 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5952098 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5952099 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5952100 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5952101 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5952102 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002

5952105 just smile and shut up give me the money i have a gun
5952106 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5952107 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5952108 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5952109 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5952110 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5952111 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5952112 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5952113 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5952114 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5952115 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5952116 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5952117 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5952118 we are certainly not going to appoint two people in the same family
5952119 you have a grandfather a granddaughter a grandson and the wife of a grandson
5952120 to be a little facetious you could have a family reunion and almost have a quorum
5952121 the commission has a conscience and their conscience wont allow them to do this
5952122 this is a gentleman that knows how to bring people together
5952123 we just cant afford to make a mistake theres too much at stake
5952124 we have always taken our own childrens educations seriously and we want nothing for your children we wouldnt want for our own
5952125 it has to be done quickly fairly and hopefully in a way that will not generate some of the ill feelings that have been created
5952126 we would not like to shut the door on that
5952127 you may not be coming back to us for public funding
5952128 ranger is doing about the same not worse and not better
5952129 they caused the problem and they should pay for their errors
5952130 it was never my responsibility to make sure their equipment was running properly
5952131 however six months of back billing in the absence of any further public service commission action will result in 621 000 remaining uncollected from the under billed customers
5952132 this amount would eventually be paid by questars other customers however about 98 000 that is at risk to questar would remain uncollected and be a loss to the company
5952133 we agree with the report to the extent that it indicates the company has done everything it can to resolve this problem
5952134 this really looks like it is shaping up to be a six month back billing issue or a 24 month issue
5952135 i could understand if i owed money because of a billing error
5952136 but this had to do with their equipment not being checked to make sure it was operating properly
5952137 we will be providing the psc with some different recommendations
5952138 utilities are not automatically entitled to recover all costs from ratepayers for unjustified mistakes
5952139 what once was a nice running river was suddenly an incredible torrent of water washing through the area
5952140 the 150 foot clear blue green waterfall had turned to mud
5952141 if you were caught in the river it would be really hard to survive
5952142 we believe we have a pretty good handle on who was down there but there is a possibility that there may be people in the canyon were not aware of
5952143 let me assure you that the seriousness of our business at discovery gateway and what we offer salt lake county families is of the utmost importance
5952144 what is your plan to monitor that and monitor it closely before it becomes too late
5952145 i dont want to wait until next may to figure out how to fix this
5952146 this is a time that everyone is tightening their belts we continue to remain extremely proud that this is still a very good opportunity for parents and children to come and play and enjoy the fruits of salt lake county
5952147 our little bridger gave a wave to the doctors today and a little grin
5952148 the way that is going to prevent that is to take the children out of the home
5952149 wouldnt you like them to be there for each other if you couldnt be
5952150 she never got anything other than we want the children
5952151 she is going to do everything she can to see this thing through and be reunited with her daughter again
5952152 where people can be themselves where people can feel welcome
5952153 the governor gave us a heads up but i dont recall any consultation on it
5952154 we probably got 48 hours notice that he was going to announce it
5952155 but the way it has been rolled out its extremely negative to the public and ought to be changed immediately
5952156 there are some unresolved issues right now and we dont have the answers because this was an executive decision
5952157 so i support it but ill put him to the burden of proof to show that it produced the savings and did not affect the level of service
5952158 we wish the governor would have included employees in the dialogue around working 4 utah
5952159 well take the pulse of our members when things calm down
5952160 any time you involve stakeholders and we definitely are if you thoroughly vet it you get a better product
5952161 the city will proceed to expeditiously provide the bond funds for the remodeling of the old library building
5952162 hysteria here at city hall about the wheels coming off the project
5952163 i do need some more time to look into that
5952164 he says his priority has been responding to constituents needs
5952165 following rapid assessments carried out in lanao del sur and lanao del norte we announce this additional response to idps internally displaced persons
5952166 in the current unpredictable security situation vulnerable victims of these clashes urgently need to receive humanitarian assistance especially essential food among other complimentary relief items
5952167 we hope for peace and stability so that affected families in mindanao can soon return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives
5952168 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
5952169 and it is waiting for the city to do the same
5952170 were here to say were picking fruit we can reach
5952171 dont come back with a presentation on how great the leonardo is thats not what we want to hear we want to hear that youve fixed it
5952172 everyone wonders if theres an agenda if this process is just a red herring
5952173 bringing a world class art science and culture facility to library square
5952174 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
5952175 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5952176 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday
5952177 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
5952178 it is only fair that since county taxpayers contribute that money
5952179 they should have more input into how that money is spent
5952180 geographic representation as reflected in the membership of state committees boards and commissions
5952181 suggests that the varied perspectives of utahns are heard and are recognized as playing an essential role in the development of public policy in utah
5952182 strangulation severe blows to the head and torso intense squeezing and damage to his testicle

5952184 i didnt think the design work was that big of a deal until it all came together and i got to meet the athletes at team processing

5952187 but there were a lot of elements that had to go into a little piece of jewelry and it had to be wearable and comfortable
5952188 i think i kicked pretty obvious in her head i dont know why the judges werent scoring it i think its too early in the morning for them
5952189 that way its not judged by humans its by how much force you get hit
5952190 that one was pretty close depending how you look at it she could have won she could have lost
5952191 hes the president of the chinese association he has power

5952193 i know that he has a good heart and the intent to pay back all that has been lost i sincerely ask that the court will allow him the time to bring this plan into fruition
5952194 the five days in jail will let you look forward to what youll be facing on a real long term basis should you not meet the terms of your probation

5952285 i see my friends with their siblings and as ive grown older and older i yearn for the intimate contact and memories they have
5952286 the one big drawback to being an only is the pressure there is very much a sense that the entire fate of the family hinges on you parents of an only had better come to terms with the fact that they may or may not be grandparents i feel like i failed my parents in not providing them with grandkids especially knowing that they would be top notch outta this world grandparents

5952678 the conventional wisdom is that this election is going to be a referendum on barack obama
5952679 his people are smart enough to realize this doesnt necessarily work to their benefit
5952680 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
5952681 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
5952682 its revealing that barack obama attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
5952683 what sen obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice

5952689 for whatever candidate comes in second theres plenty of time to reverse that order

5952710 i would like to go in and meet with president barack obama
5952711 sir this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to mr obama ive told you already several times that mr obama is not the president and doesnt reside here dont you understand
5952712 oh i understand you fine i just love hearing your answer
5952713 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
5952714 its not just for me but for the people you drive
5952715 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
5952716 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
5952717 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
5952718 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
5952719 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
5952720 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5952721 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5952722 its easy to ignore 3 or 5 percent votes but its pretty hard to ignore 22 percent votes or 39 percent votes
5952723 that proposal was rejected by stockholders however the company elected to prepare a report simply because it had been a timely issue

5952725 it just doesnt seem to us that there is a whole lot of value to shareholders to do a study to tell them what they already know
5952726 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5952727 we would not comment on government to government discussions even to confirm that such discussions are taking place
5952728 rising prices of commodities over the past several years peanuts cocoa sugar etc these are basic foodstuffs essential for life and the price is skyrocketing
5952729 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
5952730 market prices for ingredients such as cocoa corn sweeteners sugar and peanuts are up 20 to 45 since the beginning of the year
5952731 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5952732 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5952733 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5952734 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5952735 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5952736 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5952737 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5952738 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5952739 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5952740 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5952741 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5952742 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5952743 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5952744 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5952745 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5952746 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5952747 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5952748 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5952749 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5952750 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5952751 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
5952752 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
5952753 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
5952754 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
5952755 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
5952756 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
5952757 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
5952758 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
5952759 there were jews dancing in the streets on 9 11
5952760 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5952761 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5952762 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5952763 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5952764 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5952765 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5952766 theyll find another fake issue to focus on and then another
5952767 politicians use the poor when its convenient to chant slogans but really its all about power
5952768 its hard to be a man when you are scared like a little kid and the world has become a little too mean
5952769 global metal is more of a documentary in the true sense of the word
5952770 because its about more than just music its about culture and about youth and about globalization these are buzzwords that even the cbc loves
5952771 was it difficult getting into all these countries and were you intimidated or scared going to all of these countries
5952772 mostly all the beggars are from other states and train scheduled from patna to goa will create the problem

5952794 trintechs performance in q2 was solid with revenue growth of 18 and adjusted ebitda net income of 215 000 despite the challenges of the economic environment however the continued uncertainty in the market has negatively impacted our revenue and earnings results and business outlook for the rest of the year our management focus will continue to be on driving revenue growth and ebitda profitability while extracting cost synergies from our recent acquisition of movaris and maintaining a strong vigilance on our operating cost base given our outlook for the business following shareholder approval of our share buy back at our recent agm we intend to initiate the purchase of our stock as our board strongly feels that the current trintech share price does not accurately reflect the true enterprise value of the business
5952795 in spite of the difficult economic environment we believe our strategy of focusing on a broader product set expanding our presence in the international market and ensuring an efficient operating cost base will enable trintech to deliver continued year over year growth in revenue and ebitda profitability

5952818 using personality tests for personnel selection is sometimes regarded as controversial the difficulty is that people can often perceive what characteristics are desirable youre unlikely to admit to having hallucinations people who answer honestly might be at a disadvantage and this tends to show up if you look at the relationship between test scores and performance
5952819 correlations between personality test scores and job performance are often weaker than a similar comparison with ability based tests
5952820 ultimately psychometrics can only ever used by companies in the context of a wider selection process the test will only inform the decision it wont make the decision

5952900 the world cup qualifiers are on our doorstep and were ready
5952901 me and john have been discussing this for years not just days and hopefully the plan is coming together south africa was at the forefront of our minds
5952902 in the meantime flynn is concentrating on the the u21 campaign that this week overshadows the senior teams friendly with georgia at swanseas liberty stadium on wednesday
5952903 its a cup final its a one off game we need to win to qualify for the next stages its a big one
5952904 i had some important games in management at wrexham and swansea but in terms of international football this us up there amongst the best
5952905 having worked with this group for almost four years i cant wait for wednesday
5952906 this hasnt happened overnight its been a long hard detailed plan and effort put in by a lot of people
5952907 weve got some talented young players and they now have to make the step up into the senior squad and show how good they are
5952908 in terms in of strength in depth i could probably have pick two teams to play against each other and it would be a close game
5952909 weve got strength and cover in all departments weve lost the captain joe jacobson with injury and hes been replaced by gareth bale thats not a bad replacement i must say
5952910 it makes my job better to work with quality players whove come back in and the preparation has been excellent
5952911 weve been on this path for the last few years
5952912 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5952913 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5952914 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5952915 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5952916 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5952917 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5952918 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5952919 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5952920 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5952921 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk

5952954 entrants who pride themselves on their stallion qualities will perform live for the online casting event
5952955 decided to splash some cum on our cookies and whoever cum later has to eat em
5952956 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5952957 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5952958 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5952959 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5952960 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5952961 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5952962 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5952963 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
5952964 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
5952965 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state
5952966 we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
5952967 the good news from america most environmentalists are indeed leftists who support the redistribution of wealth and believe in a simpler lifestyle
5952968 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5952969 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5952970 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5952971 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5952972 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5952973 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5952974 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5952975 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5952976 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5952977 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5952978 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5952979 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5952980 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
5952981 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
5952982 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
5952983 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5952984 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5952985 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5952986 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
5952987 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside sen barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5952988 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5952989 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5952990 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5952991 this turn of events from hero to someone who defrauds a nation is just baffling i dont know how he got from one point to the other
5952992 we havent been able to get in touch with him
5952993 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5952994 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5952995 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5952996 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5952997 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5952998 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5952999 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5953000 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5953001 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5953002 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5953003 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5953004 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5953005 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5953006 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5953007 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5953008 hakan is the babe of gay men they have been looking forward for some kind of hakans buttholes get pounded by some horny sexy gay rascals
5953009 one of americas hottest gay for pay solo strokers has been up to something
5953010 sucking cock should be a hot experience for both the sucker and the suckee
5953011 after our eyes glue to johnnys huge snake madonna and i look at each other in amazement
5953012 suddenly johnnys moans become louder until i can hear madonna make gulping noises right after johnny leaves madonna proceeds to sing and she sounds wonderful
5953013 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
5953014 its not anything shes expecting and not anything shes shooting for
5953015 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
5953016 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
5953017 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5953018 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
5953019 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
5953020 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
5953021 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
5953022 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
5953023 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
5953024 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
5953025 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
5953026 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
5953027 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
5953028 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
5953029 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
5953030 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
5953031 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
5953032 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5953033 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5953034 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5953035 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5953036 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5953037 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5953038 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5953039 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5953040 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5953041 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5953042 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5953043 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5953044 who wants to watch this crap anyway ive seen all these people before and when i want to jerk off to porn i just go online and find something on xtube
5953045 are you gonna set an agenda of change or one of compromise of what the republican minority is gonna allow you to do in the congress
5953046 e ven if we do well theres still gonna be almost half the country that votes for somebody else so one of the things that we have to understand is that theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are and my core principles are that im fighting for ordinary americans to make sure that they can live out their american dream and i am fighting to make sure that our values and ideals enshrined in our constitution and our declaration of independence are upheld
5953047 winning elections and governing in america is a complex undertaking and it takes some recognition that most of the country is more moderate
5953048 more people identify themselves as moderates than either liberal or conservative i think hes a moderate but a liberal moderate and hes not running as an ideologue which i think is important i do think though he has to sharpen his message so that those moderates are comfortable with his values
5953049 hes changed the emphasis in which he talks about things hes in for a hard fight and there are large swatches of the country that are waiting to see if hes pretty close to them in terms of values this hasnt been easy for democrats to do theres a reason democrats have lost seven out of the last 10 elections for president withobama youve seen an emphasis on things like faith based initiatives which have always been part of his platform but wasnt a major emphasis in the primary campaign
5953050 theres always been this tension about whether you run a populist campaign geared towards middle class voters their needs their angers
5953051 or do you run a moderate dlc democratic leadership council model the truth is weve come out of this hybrid of the two
5953052 he has to show people who dont live in seattle or new york city that hes real
5953053 campaigns arent about issues theyre about emotions raw emotions and he has to spend a lot of time speaking to people in the middle of america he has to broaden his voice
5953054 i remind a lot of democrats who didnt vote for al gore because he wasnt liberal enough that we got george bush
5953055 how did that help the liberal cause al gore would not have gotten us into iraq and he wouldnt have appointed supreme court justices like johnalito and john roberts i am not one of those who sits back and says youre either 100 percent with us or youre against us it doesnt make sense obama might be something you might not like to win in pennsylvania or somewhere else governing is more important than purity youve got to keep your ideals but you have to be a realist
5953056 you ran great guns in the campaign it was an insurgency boy a sight to see and then you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath just the middle of the road nothing but a long line painted yellow i wanted to retire five years ago but i waited for a democrat i wanted a democrat hmmph and instead i got you
5953057 if you look at where the american people are were where the american people are on issue after issue after issue
5953058 whether its getting responsibly out of iraq or forming an energy independence plan i think sen obamas where the american public is
5953059 democrats are two three times more energized about their nominee than republicans are about theirs the great thing is that the base wants change and independents in this country want change as a matter of fact moderate republicans want change i think were fortunate that we have a message that carries across all of those platforms
5953060 theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
5953061 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5953062 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5953063 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5953064 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5953065 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5953066 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5953067 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5953068 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5953069 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5953070 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5953071 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5953072 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5953073 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5953074 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5953075 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5953076 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5953077 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5953078 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5953079 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5953080 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5953081 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5953082 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5953083 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5953084 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5953085 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5953086 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5953087 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5953088 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5953089 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5953090 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5953091 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5953092 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5953093 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5953094 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5953095 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5953096 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5953097 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5953098 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5953099 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com
5953100 were thrilled to partner with drgreene com the most trusted online source for childrens health and the leading online community of parents seeking to raise their children in healthy and sustainable households
5953101 dr greene who has been called the al gore of pediatrics has created a thriving community of parents seeking to educate themselves on health and parenting issues to make better choices for their children his advice combines practical wisdom warm empathy a deep respect for parents children and the environment and will provide our marketing partners with the premium online brand for childrens health and parenting the combination of drgreene com and our other moms and family channel sites gives us a targeted highly effective way to engage this affluent and influential audience
5953102 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5953103 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5953104 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5953105 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5953106 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5953107 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5953108 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5953109 later franco would tell cage about all this and it would become the inspiration for when cages character in the movie a pimp called acid yellow snorts a line and then declares
5953110 it was it was mixed because on one hand it was scary strange to be there you know ive done bad things and i have been arrested but i have never been in that situation so i was feeling all that but then on the other hand it is just like a human interaction so theres none of the movie music going on to heighten the situation and so it had this strange you know casualness to it just people having sex or about to have sex and there i am standing in the room you know and so that was weird
5953111 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5953112 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5953113 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5953114 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5953115 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5953116 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5953117 fresh hot young muscle bound men wearing nothing but skin tight spandex wrestling gear that accentuates every muscle and bulge theyre wearing nothing underneath those singlets not even a jock
5953118 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5953119 they told me there are going to be resources here
5953120 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5953121 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5953122 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5953123 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5953124 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5953125 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5953126 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5953127 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5953128 cause rik kappus and marc angelo are looking slightly easter eggy or slightly albinoish depending on the light and its making us hesitate to think about what their manly touches must feel like and we
5953129 within 24 hours it will be omitted from our web site please use the original e mail adress of your company when sending the e mail
5953130 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5953131 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5953132 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5953133 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5953134 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5953135 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5953136 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5953137 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5953138 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5953139 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5953140 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5953141 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5953142 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5953143 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5953144 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5953145 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5953146 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5953147 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5953148 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5953149 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5953150 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5953151 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5953152 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5953153 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5953154 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5953155 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5953156 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5953157 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5953158 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5953159 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5953160 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5953161 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5953162 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5953163 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5953164 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5953165 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5953166 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5953167 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5953168 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5953169 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5953170 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5953171 ujian toefl memang sukar soalnya banyak yang mengecoh selain itu waktu yang tersedia sangat pendek dalam waktu 130 menit harus mengerjakan 140 soal dan mengerjakan esai 300 kata dalam waktu 30 menit untuk ujian listening peserta ujian harus mengerahkan konsentrasi karena percakapannya sangat cepat sering tidak jelas dan hanya diputar satu kali
5953172 sebaiknya ambillah kursus persiapan toefl untuk meningkatkan pemahaman bahasa inggris persiapan juga bisa dilakukan dengan mempelajari buku buku toefl mencoba mengerjakan soal soalnya lalu mencocokkan jawabannya dengan sering mencoba soal soal tersebut peserta menjadi terbiasa dengan jebakan jebakan yang ada di toefl
5953173 jika sudah biasa mengerjakan maka peserta tes tidak lagi merasa gugup dan grogi saat ujian sesiap apa pun seorang peserta jika perasaan tidak tenang maka dia bisa gagal dalam ujian itu
5953174 tetapi jangan buat catatan karena hal itu dilarang jika tidak yakin tebak saja
5953175 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5953176 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5953177 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5953178 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5953179 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5953180 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5953181 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5953182 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5953183 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5953184 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5953185 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5953186 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5953187 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5953188 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5953189 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5953190 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5953191 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5953192 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5953193 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5953194 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5953195 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5953196 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5953197 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5953198 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5953199 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5953200 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
5953201 abajo las m scaras ahora nos topamos con esta decisi n arbitraria e ilegal odiosamente contraria a cualquier sentido de la igualdad y del derecho en el mundo civilizado
5953202 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5953203 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5953204 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5953205 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5953206 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5953207 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5953208 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5953209 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
5953210 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
5953211 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
5953212 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
5953213 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
5953214 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
5953215 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
5953216 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5953217 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5953218 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5953219 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5953220 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5953221 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5953222 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5953223 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5953224 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
5953225 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
5953226 i tell them not to sit down unless we are told to
5953227 we just want to keep them all warm and ready to enter the game because everyone on this team contributes
5953228 we arent ever going to be the tallest team on the floor
5953229 but we play really good defense and i think we are one of the better serving teams around so that helps too
5953230 we really just are able to rise to situations like that because we are all so close all best friends so we really start playing well for each other and helping each other out
5953231 we didnt have to take time to build up team chemistry we came in ready to compete and ready to go out and win
5953232 stratford is going to be really good but they havent played a tournament yet so they just havent been able to get the same kind of match experience we have already this year
5953233 i know its nice for them to go home and get them out of here a lot earlier now
5953234 coaches need to get in a routine as the regular season but weve always approached it that way take the third game kind of go through your normal routine because next weeks kind of crazy
5953235 thats what he does for us but he still has the ability to get out and do some things catching the ball
5953236 well its a tough situation because first off hes a good football player he played very well in arizona hes a good special teams player as well
5953237 it just depends on your philosophy weve just got the mindset where we want to run the ball we feel if we can run the ball effectively and face man coverage we dont think anybody can guard our receivers for too long
5953238 i cant say that too loud around alex but i think we have the ability to throw the ball really well
5953239 weve got some receivers that are playing really well i think our quarterback has a lot of confidence right now both of our quarterbacks do we could very well be maybe a little different before its all said and done
5953240 whatever you do decide you just have to commit to it
5953241 regardless of who your players are if you commit to it you can get good at anything youve got to have very good players to be great at anything but were committed to that and we will end up being good at it
5953242 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5953243 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5953244 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5953245 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5953246 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5953247 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5953248 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5953249 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5953250 southern and western beaches in korea may appear to be nearly half water and half jellyfish
5953251 i have a reason to thank the lord two months ago my husband jim had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed the pain was excruciating and the doctors didnt know if they could help him
5953252 jim was unable to hold me or the children and every move caused him terrible pain we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation they were able to piece together the the service
5953253 i have a reason to thank the lord two months ago my husband jim had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed the pain was excruciating and the doctors didnt know if they could help him
5953254 jim was unable to hold me or the children and every move caused him terrible pain we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of jims scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place
5953255 now jim is out of the hospital and the doctors say with time his scrotum should recover completely
5953256 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5953257 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5953258 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5953259 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5953260 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5953261 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5953262 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5953263 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5953264 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5953265 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5953266 i seem caught in time my head leaves me behind body falls cold and i see heaven
5953267 are by far the three best studio albums and im a pretty big fan of any every of the various live recordings which focus on the music of those early albums
5953268 cry freedom gt dancing nancies dm tim reynolds live at luther college
5953269 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5953270 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5953271 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5953272 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5953273 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5953274 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5953275 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5953276 get it off the air and i really mean it
5953277 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5953278 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5953279 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5953280 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5953281 i am married to the next president of the united states
5953282 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5953283 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5953284 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5953285 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5953286 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5953287 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5953288 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5953289 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5953290 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5953291 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5953292 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5953293 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5953294 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5953295 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5953296 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5953297 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5953298 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5953299 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5953300 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5953301 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5953302 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5953303 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5953304 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5953305 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5953306 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5953307 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5953308 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5953309 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5953310 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5953311 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5953312 theres a sucker born every minute and they are all hillary supporters
5953313 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5953314 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5953315 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5953316 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5953317 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5953318 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5953319 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5953320 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5953321 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5953322 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5953323 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5953324 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5953325 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5953326 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5953327 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5953328 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5953329 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5953330 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5953331 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5953332 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5953333 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5953334 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5953335 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5953336 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5953337 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5953338 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5953339 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5953340 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5953341 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5953342 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5953343 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5953346 the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5953347 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5953348 it just catches and its difficult to get a groove
5953349 i feel like im getting better each game and its not really stopping me from playing obviously ive been playing a lot of minutes
5953350 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
5953351 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
5953352 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
5953353 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
5953354 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
5953355 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
5953356 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
5953357 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
5953358 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect
5953359 i saw three brown dogs having a feed of this bloke they were down on the inside of his legs
5953360 he was there lying on the ground i hunted those dogs i threw rocks at them and yelled at them to get away from the man
5953361 i ran over and then put my fingers on his neck to check for a pulse but he was dead i yelled out and told one of my relations to call the cops

5953363 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5953364 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5953365 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5953366 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between bph luts and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5953367 postoperative ileus remains the single greatest barrier to hospital discharge in otherwise uncomplicated colorectal surgery
5953368 if this relatively easy safe and cheap intervention can help it is certainly something worth trying
5953369 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of hospital stay
5953370 this doesnt mean that if you give someone chewing gum they will just jump out of bed and feel good enough to go home
5953371 you might be in first but run like youre not
5953372 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5953373 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
5953374 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5953375 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5953376 the government picks health plans then we have to pick a plan from their list
5953377 our community believes its very important to move on an agenda of health care reform
5953378 i think it shows that the american people are coming together
5953379 those who were opposed to health care reform in the past now know its critically important
5953380 just do it how one couple turned off the tv and turned on their sex lives for 101 days no excuses
5953381 at first i sort of thought thats funny ha ha
5953382 but i know annie pretty well and she loves a challenge we talked about it more that night and the next morning and i knew she was serious
5953383 when saturday night sex becomes routine that is when couples need to make sure they are still wooing each other by incorporating spontaneity and novelty
5953384 the next morning i woke up and thought we really need to do this
5953385 our marriage really needs to do this thats how it started
5953386 youve got your porno but now its my turn sex toys
5953387 ive got to research it but im always hearing about how women are using sex toys there are sex toys parties its on oprah its supposed to be healthy im nearly forty and ive never even touched one
5953388 you work you commute you have kids you have to clean up make sure they brush their teeth by the time that part of the day is over you are just tired and ready to zone out
5953389 we werent doing it for the sake of doing it
5953390 the point was to see what would happen we treated it like we were dating again we started looking forward to it
5953391 i really think we communicate so much clearer and with so much more honesty now
5953392 there were so many times before that we hadnt even hugged for like three days in a row we gravitate toward rubbing each others backs more we realize how important it is to put the kids to bed and spend time together
5953393 i would love to see this conversation in every home in america
5953394 gay straight with kids or without this is a conversation that people shrink from and yet its so important once you stop making love to your partner you become roommates whether its five times a month or three times a month just being comfortable with that number is most important
5953395 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination

5953399 hey sis its your big eighteen and im trying to write you a nice card but i cant seem to get anything going so here it is
5953400 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5953401 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5953402 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
5953403 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 mu m which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult beta globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
5953404 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
5953405 healthcare payers and providers are grappling with the best techniques for treating adhd as knowledge of this disruptive and sometimes debilitating disease spreads unfortunately in most cases current evidence is limited and further studies are needed before these drugs can be unequivocally recommended for use
5953406 unfortunately for sufferers of adhd and their families there are few clear conclusions that can be drawn from the research to date on the best treatment options in the case of stimulant treatment for children clinical studies do demonstrate short term relief but many families have concerns about administering stimulants to children in these cases atomoxetine represents a good option with clinical evidence demonstrating some effectiveness
5953407 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5953408 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5953409 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5953410 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5953411 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5953412 management of severe pain with strong opioids is unfortunately associated with a number of side effects the most prevalent side effect is development of constipation constipation may lead to discomfort and ineffective analgesia
5953413 the new generation of prokinetic drugs with peripheral opioid antagonistic actions seems to offer our patients a more effective solution to opioid induced bowel problems than conventional laxative therapies
5953414 ihv has created a collaborative environment where multidisciplinary research education and clinical programs work to accelerate the development of pioneering therapies for hiv aids we are honored to have been accepted to discuss our data with ihvs respected team and members of the research and medical communities
5953415 our work is unraveling a link between inflammatory events that characterize early stages of infection the importance of inflammation on susceptibility to hiv and a link to an individuals mhc molecules
5953416 our findings suggest that with the proper predictions we can synthesize targeted peptides to treat people with different types of mhc alleles providing potentially an inexpensive biologically active therapy for hiv
5953417 while the results in human clinical trials are promising the challenge has been identifying the mechanism and the active component of the mixtures
5953418 it appears to be precisely when the non specific cells dont die on cue that chronic pathologies begin
5953419 peripheral cd4 loss of regulatory t cells is associated with persistent viremia in chronic hiv infection
5953420 depletion of regulatory t cells is associated with immune activation
5953421 we are very excited after many years of research to finally have discovered what appears to be the promising mechanism of action that could optimize our treatment to its fullest potential this also opens the door to a paradigm shift in thinking around hiv aids therapies
5953422 such misrepresentation may defeat the purpose of the initiatives to promote the brunei halal brand and its integrity in the global market
5953423 it was the greatest game for everyone and fortunately we managed to win it
5953424 we havent achieved anything yet but beating brazil with a result like this is wonderful
5953425 it was unbelievable you just have to look at the scoreboard
5953426 not just in events such as this but for all activities and projects for the growth and nation development economies and community welfare
5953427 the 20 activities lined up for his majestys birthday celebration carried out from early july till august 3 this year demonstrate the commitment loyalty and support by those involved in the celebrations
5953428 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5953429 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5953430 well thats what theyve done wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure reports of the use of munitions that should never be used against civilians the harassment along highways of legitimate comers the closing of the port of poti which is now starting to affect neighboring states
5953431 i think this is not a very good picture for russias strategic objectives
5953432 when asked if their focus on customer experience is costing the company money many business leaders still say yes but our findings show a clear difference between those who have an organization wide definition of it and those who havent customer experience is a path to improved profitability not a trade off from it
5953433 of these elite organizations 67 percent report meeting or exceeding revenue targets 65 percent meet or exceed profit targets
5953434 simply put these organizations use customer experience as a strategy for achieving performance and its working

5953453 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5953454 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5953455 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said

5953591 an ideological goal that describes a better future for followers
5953592 in fact articulation of an ideological goal as a vision for a better future for which followers have a moral claim is the sine quo non of all charismatic visionary theories
5953593 ultimately becomes moral in that it raises the level of human conduct and ethical aspiration of both leader and led and thus has a transforming effect on both

5953603 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5953604 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5953605 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5953606 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5953607 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5953608 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5953609 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5953610 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5953611 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5953612 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5953637 yeah it may seem like god is far away sometimes
5953638 we put a set of technologies in windows vista that fundamentally made it harder to pirate number one and number two we have the ability in windows vista to update the product based on piracy types that were seeing in the market
5953639 so for example over the last 12 months there are three leading piracy types three leading ways that people are pirating windows vista getting around the things that weve done and weve updated millions of systems globally to address that leak or that hole
5953640 weve seen very very good results in the efforts that weve done to date and certainly you saw in our bottom line numbers the progress that we made on this front last fiscal year and i certainly expect as this technology and as windows vista makes its way more broadly into the install base that those demand efforts will continue to pay dividends
5953641 mid march 2008 delivery of microsoft windows vista business with sp1 in a special action pack shipment to partners worldwide to make it easier for you to deploy the final release of windows vista sp1 for internal use all subscribers will receive full code microsoft will offer one licence for windows vista ultimate with sp1 full code for internal use so you can discuss this products benefits and features with customers who need a single pc to fulfil their work travel and entertainment needs this software will be delivered in the regular action pack quarterly update april 2008 for current subscribers and for new action pack subscribers starting in april 2008
5953642 you will receive full code but the licence is an upgrade to windows vista with sp1 this means that you must have licenced a qualified full desktop pc operating system on the device before you are eligible to install the full version of windows vista small business with sp1 on that same device this software is for your organisations internal installation only and may not be installed on any other computer outside your organisation on either a permanent or a temporary basis
5953643 a major theme is around windows vista deployment youll hear from brad brooks about where we are its time for us to bust through the mist weve got to bust through the mist with you first because youre out there with our customers you must be running our software first so that you can be credible and honest in front of our customers you also have to be supported on the back end so i think our goal today with you is to bust through the mist on windows vista
5953644 and lets start that story the real story at the beginning with the creation of windows vista
5953645 vista is still struggling to gain a foothold in large companies
5953646 this report doesnt reflect the normal enterprise os adoption cycle enterprise adoption of oses has always been much slower than consumer adoption after all upgrading the pc in your living room is easy but upgrading an entire front and back end infrastructure to thousands of users without downtime is much more complex and that takes time
5953647 its also important to note that weve sold 180 million copies of windows vista so far 40 million of which were in the last quarter alone and that there are thousands of enterprise customers deploying windows vista by the thousands of seats on a weekly basis including heavy hitters like the united states air force ppg industries and cerner
5953648 a new build of sp3 is floating on the net build 5503 the last build the public rc2 was build 3311 which microsoft released in mid february so its quite a jump between the two
5953649 when we asked it pros about their satisfaction with vista scores were low with those who were not using the product yet high with those who were using the product interesting theres no denying that vista has had a difficult time in the press over the last year but i think much of this negative coverage has left a hangover with customer perception many of the reasons for the negative press things like application compatibility and device driver coverage are things of the past the research done in the survey supports this theory
5953650 the ones who are actually using it are now having positive experiences
5953651 the reason we put uac into the platform was to annoy users im serious
5953652 we needed to change the ecosystem and we needed a heavy hammer to do it
5953653 many of the situations we deal with have to do with users being uninformed about threats on the internet
5953654 are there some annoyances with uac yes but advanced users know how to get around them
5953655 for people working in an office close to it its not a problem but when you have a very mobile workforce and you have to load and update applications thats when it becomes more of an issue
5953656 most users on a daily basis actually have zero uac prompts
5953657 uac is not a perfect security boundary but it has helped us move from zero click exploits to one click defense
5953658 b ut at least 250 000 000 in crucial projects remained
5953659 so what you can only imagine happening is that theyre burying on the levee youve got flood levels coming over the banks of the river youve got floating caskets that are pushed up above the ground and you can only imagine these levees sloped down into the city if there was enough water you could have caskets floating through the streets of the city
5953660 that no longer really never happens in new orleans because the land has been drained since the turn of the century a system of water pumps drains water out from under the city 24 hours a day
5953661 this makes new orleans the most vulnerable major city to hurricanes
5953662 thats because the water has to go down not up to reach it
5953663 winds greater than 155 miles per hour and storm surge generally greater than 18 feet
5953664 theres no question that those kind of conditions might have just reached the limit of what that particular levee could handle
5953665 once it got over it began to scour down at the base of that flood wall on the protected side
5953666 the effect is like a high low tackle in football you hit the head and feet at the same time from opposite directions and it goes down
5953667 g stopped by today to visit and say goodbye to me and the kiddos because there might not be another chance since school will be back in session soon
5953668 its important to note that this update does not disable the exploits it finds
5953669 in the future we will integrate the removal of the exploits with the detection
5953670 and find out you have been riped off like that
5953671 you were the treasure in my hand the one who always stood beside me so unaware how foolishly i believed that you would always be there but then there came a day when i turned my head and you slipped away
5953672 sunny days seem to hurt the most i wear the pain like a heavy coat i feel you everywhere i go i see your smile i see your face i hear you laughin in the rain i still cant believe your gone
5953673 oh how we cried the day you left us we gathered round your grave to grieve wish i could see the angels faces when they hear your sweet voice sing
5953674 i lose my way and its not to long before you point it out i can not cry because i know thats weakness in your eyes im forcd to fake a smile a laugh every day of my life my heart cant possibly break when it wasnt even whole to start with
5953675 but nobody knew how much she blamed herself for years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breathe she finally drank her pain away a little at a time but she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind until the night she put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger finally drank away his memory life is sure but this time it was bigger than the strength she had to get up off her knees
5953676 i thought i knew the girl so well if she was sad i couldnt tell i missed the point i missed the signs so if shes gone the fault was mine
5953677 its something unpredictable but in the end is right i hope you had the time of your life
5953678 a half inch or an inch and were in trouble
5953679 it came in through all three doors that i have
5953680 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5953681 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5953682 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said
5953683 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information dr elliot said
5953684 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5953685 do not be easily hoodwinked by the opposition promises and fall for their trickery because if we were to believe them we will be quarrelling with each other
5953686 wait was that really god maybe it was part of my weird imagination i bet what he meant was
5953687 well done good and faithful servant you did many things that were good in my sight but do you want to see what you could have done if you had waited a little longer
5953688 be still and know that he is god remember the first and best commandment which is to love the lord you god with all your heart mind and strength seek his kingdom first and hell take care of the rest he is faithful and is not afraid to prove his faithfulness to you if you take the time to ask do not let anyone convince you that prayer is a waste of time it is conversation with the god that created the universe and he loves you he loves you he loves you he wants nothing more than for you to receive his love and seek to love him in return ministry service loving people all mean nothing if we have not fallen in love with him first be encouraged that the entire bible can be summarized as a love story of god longing to save man though we prostitute ourselves over and over again all so we could dwell with him again this is the message of christ all done so we could stand blameless and cleansed of rebellion in his presence he is our only hope of glory he is our saviour creator and husband our hosea dear bride all that he wants is your heart
5953689 i will go after my my lovers who give me my bread and my water
5953690 das d rfte die letzten zweifel an der bilanz beseitigen
5953691 die bundesrepublik ist das land mit den meisten zeitschriften weltweit und h ngt in diesem bereich sogar die vereinigten staaten ab es gibt kaum ein themengebiet dem sich nicht ein titel ausf hrlich widmet
5953692 diese haben meist eine geringe auflage werden aber wegen der spezialthematik trotz hoher einzelpreise gerne gekauft
5953693 das zeigt dass gerade in deutschland ein ungeheurer markt f r entsprechende angebote vorhanden ist
5953694 diese zahlen stammen noch aus dem jahr 2006 heute ist daher sicher von einem noch h heren prozentsatz auszugehen
5953695 das hat in der j ngeren vergangenheit zu einer rasanten zunahme neuer onlinedienste gef hrt versch rft wird diese tatsache noch durch die vielzahl an m glichkeiten die web 2 0 heute bietet da die menschen hier die m glichkeit bekommen selbst aktiv am geschehen mitzuwirken und gestalterisch t tig zu werden potenzieren sich die marktchancen digitaler gesch ftsmodelle im medienbereich um ein vielfaches
5953696 im vergleich zu den verbrauchern in den usa zeigen die verbraucher in deutschland und im vereinigten k nigreich bei den 13 in der studie untersuchten technologien ein bedeutend st rkeres interesse an alternativen antriebstechnologien insbesondere bei sauberen dieseltechnologien
5953697 der interessenunterschied kann auf die tendenz der verbraucher in den eu m rkten kleinere fahrzeuge zu kaufen die wiederum der hybridelektrischen technologie zutr glicher sind zur ckgef hrt werden dieseltechnologie ist zudem in diesen regionen viel verbreiteter als in den usa
5953698 geringes interesse an satellitenradios ist auf die geringe marktdurchdringung dieser technik sowohl in deutschland als auch im vereinigten k nigreich zur ckzuf hren
5953699 allerdings ist es wahrscheinlich dass mit dem auftauchen neuer satellitenradiobetreiber nicht nur die bekanntheit sondern auch das allgemeine interesse an dieser funktion zunimmt

5953701 es gibt keinen schlechteren zeitpunkt zum verkauf einer bank als in der gegenw rtigen krise sagte dirk becker von der landsbanki kepler
5953702 sie sollten die verhandlungen f r ein jahr auf eis legen und dann wieder aufnehmen wenn alle risiken im zusammenhang mit der finanzkrise beseitigt sind
5953703 die deutsche post die zufriedenstellende operative ergebnisse ausweist steht nicht unter druck die postbank zu verkaufen
5953704 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen
5953705 zudem d rfte der k ufer es schwer haben vor seinen aktion ren zu rechtfertigen warum man ein unternehmen bernimmt dass eine h here bewertung als man selbst hat

5953711 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5953712 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5953713 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5953714 god has given gifts to each of you from his great variety of spiritual gifts manage them well so that gods generousity can flow through you are you called to be a speaker then speak as though god himself were speaking through you are you called to help others do it with all the strength and energy that god supplies then god will be given glory in everything through jesus christ all glory and power belong to him forever and ever amen

5953719 the union rescue mission was the perfect place to make the biggest impact and i really look forward to forming a relationship with them and the people who benefit from the great work that they do
5953720 you want to be the guy in that situation to get the job done and you expect those type of situations and when you get a chance to do it execute the way you want it feels great
5953721 that was a gut wrencher there when you lose that kind of lead in the ninth inning especially with two outs and to be able to come back and win the game
5953722 you certainly dont look forward to games like this but when its all said and done the fact that we lost the lead and still came back to win i think it tells you a lot about the makeup of the team
5953723 you cant really blame the pitchers for what they did when your defense sometimes gives them too many outs more than three a good ballclub is going to be able to execute and capitalize on that and thats what they did
5953724 youve got to learn from that and try not to make the same mistake
5953725 we had that feeling everybodys coming together and swinging the bat really well and you never know whos going to get that big hit
5953726 clayton struggled a little bit in this one where he didnt have his command that he had in the last few starts but thats an important sign that he was able to just get outs when he needed to
5953727 if he goes out there and pitches that way every day then we have a good shot at winning
5953728 we have a feeling that we can do some special things

5953749 these figures demonstrate that cctv in mendip is a valuable tool for police in fighting crime especially for those incidents which take place during the evenings in mendip
5953750 however we must remember that mendip is a low crime area and it is important for the public to be reassured that when action is required it is taken these results are a credit to the efforts of our staff and cctv volunteers who come from local communities
5953751 these statistics are becoming increasingly worrying and for the average amount of spam blocked per person to have nearly quadrupled in the last 3 months suggests that action desperately needs to be taken
5953752 it is reassuring to see some positive results and it is clear that some companies have been working hard to eliminate fraudulent emails entering their users accounts however as one company improves its fraud prevention another company shoots its way up the index unfortunately unless isps anti spam and anti virus providers all work together the quantities of hoax spam entering email accounts will just continue to rise

5953780 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
5953781 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
5953782 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
5953783 were now a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmy missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
5953784 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
5953785 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
5953786 i know what they can do and what they cant
5953787 i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up
5953788 the originality and force of de niros temperament demonstrate themselves under an iron control of the plastic elements such as is rarely seen in our time outside the painting of the oldest surviving members of the school of paris
5953789 we felt we had to do that because we believe there was a significant risk to public safety due to their willingness to use violence and intimidation to further their criminal behaviour
5953790 its never a slam dunk and these cases are getting more and more complex and that raises more and more issues that defence lawyers will utilitize when they come to trial to defend their clients facing these charges

5953797 we were just rattling around it was so smooth it felt easy to be honest
5953798 we knew it was fast but 3 53 314 we just cant believe it thats going to go down in history that time wont be broken in a long time were the best team in the world
5953799 this is the pinnacle weve been working on this since before sydney for the best part of a decade and what a performance
5953800 it was phenomenal yesterday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds because i wasnt my normal self and didnt want to let these guys down
5953801 to put it in perspective that was 11 seconds faster than the olympic record we set in sydney eight years ago
5953802 i know how much these guys have sacrificed for this one event its just fantastic to be part of this team weve come a long way in four years
5953803 ive still got one to go with cav hes raring to go and hopefully well do it im back to my normal self and ive trained for this so well give it a good shot

5953810 failed to fix inadequate monitoring requirements and prohibited states and local authorities from doing so
5953811 we vacate this rule because it is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements
5953812 epas about face means that some permit programs do not comply
5953813 requires that e very one of the permits issued to large factories and power plants must require adequate monitoring and that epa had failed to
5953814 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
5953815 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories
5953816 instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens
5953817 epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
5953818 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
5953819 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
5953820 to determine whether state and local permitting authorities can impose additional monitoring requirements
5953821 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us

5953833 due to the ramifications presented to us by the actions of the police
5953834 the issue is not the act itself it is the profile of fans that follow the act
5953835 wiltshire police do not have an issue with pete doherty or babyshambles
5953836 we are not killjoys and we help organisers with many events throughout the year and some are much larger than this one
5953837 the number of security guards and stewards was listed in our event management plan which was presented and accepted at the public hearing which the police attended
5953838 we might even do it at petes house in a big barn were definitely going to honour those tickets somehow but as far as the festival goes our hands are tied
5953839 babyshambles have played about 25 festivals this year theyve been playing festivals all summer whats the difference with this one
5953840 sales have been increasing quite dramatically and we were expecting quite lot of people to turn up at the gate as well
5953841 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5953842 at the moment the foreign travel orders that we have in place are not being used very much the police say theyre a bit unwieldy theres too much administration
5953843 its all very well and good saying theyve got to be tougher but if police dont like using them at the moment then lets make that work much better
5953844 the other call that were making is to have stronger bilateral co operation measures with other countries for joint investigations
5953845 relax the ocular muscles that strain to view text and images at close distance
5953846 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5953847 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5953848 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said

5953861 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5953862 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5953863 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5953864 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5953865 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5953866 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5953867 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5953868 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5953869 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5953870 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5953871 when i read the initial claims about david they just didnt ring true that a simple country bloke who had a decent family should become a supporter of terrorism

5953909 we have come out with our 15 top picks about 2 weeks back and mainly we are bullish on the psu banks we are positive on the real estate sector especially the large ones hdil and dlf in case of banks state bank of india in the construction space we are positive on acc in the cement we see lot of value and yesterday in the press ambuja cement actually announced increase in prices in two tranches those things are positive because these are domestic play come what it may in the us credit crisis etc we need cement we need steel artificially the prices are capped at this point because of inflation but going forward things will change in case of cement the overhang is that lot of new capacity is coming of what will happen but our understanding is that going forward if you start considering the limestone deposits of the cement companies start valuing them and as natural resource companies are normally getting valued there are lot of underline value in many of the cement stocks

5953919 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory

5953930 it speaks to the incredible international star power of paris hilton that we can engage a broadcaster such as itv2 in the commission of this format prior to the launch of the original programme
5953931 paris hilton is a worldwide phenomenon and itv2 is the perfect channel for her to make her first ever uk show
5953932 me and ed are back together you dont mind do you
5953933 appropriate for all customers in both ads and was unlikely to mislead in order for players to withdraw wins completely for free
5953934 we noted that a significant number of claimants would be asked to complete a form and we considered that because the ad stated that claimants could make a claim without having to fill out any forms the ad was misleading
5953935 it is only natural when a show becomes so popular to look at taking it to a wider audience but nothing is confirmed yet
5953936 weve been on this path for the last few years
5953937 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5953938 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5953939 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5953940 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5953941 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5953942 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5953943 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5953944 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5953945 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5953946 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk

5954031 the audience demographic for itv2 has become a lot more coherent and focused as has the programming and we felt that it was time to refresh the look of the channel as a result
5954032 it is always difficult for a channel to lay claim to talent
5954033 today in this room theres been yet another attempt to turn things on their head and portray the aggressors as the victim
5954034 theres a clear expression of propaganda in detriment to serious important political work which needs to be done in the security council
5954035 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5954036 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5954037 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5954038 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5954039 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5954040 n o houve qualquer perigo e que nenhuma habita o ficou em risco
5954041 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
5954042 simon has had a wonderful year with a strike rate of a wicket every 30 deliveries
5954043 the plan was to have simon still playing in september whilst this has not quite been achieved i am delighted with his contribution and the plan will be to rehab simon in a way to get him back fitter and stronger for the cricket that lies ahead of him
5954044 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
5954045 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
5954046 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
5954047 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip
5954048 she doesnt have friends or relatives here but well find somewhere for her to stay
5954049 i am an old man this is all i had all the pictures of my family everything had gone now i have nowhere to live who will look after me
5954050 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
5954051 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
5954052 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial

5954054 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5954055 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5954056 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5954057 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5954058 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5954059 he seemed fairly relaxed but tried to keep himself to himself some passengers started hassling him and asking questions but he got moved away from them all
5954060 at first he asked to be allowed to enter to thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted
5954061 lloyd told me the race would be won in the final 15 metres and thats what i kept thinking about
5954062 as far as im concerned you train for the three days of a major championships you dont train for grand prix events or one off races if you cant prepare yourself for those three days then what are you wasting your time training for
5954063 christine had an awesome finish and i just couldnt hold her off
5954064 as far as im concerned im here and ive won a gold medal im happy with what ive done
5954065 yes its something ive given thought to but its a long way away it will be great if i can say ill be there but ill take each year as it comes and deal with it when i get there
5954066 you have to realise language is alive its constantly developing
5954067 we have had no communication with the vessel so far the distress call was relayed through another ship but the tanker has been confirmed seized by pirates
5954068 this is the fourth hijacking in a month we call upon the u n and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening situation
5954069 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
5954070 as a result of that the organisation were aware that we were supporters for the cause so they decided to give us a call and see if wed be involved in the trekstock gig at the boogaloo

5954077 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5954078 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it

5954085 it is always good to go out of these kinds of matches with a win i am happy physically because i am fine coming out of this match
5954086 i am definitely thinking the body is not holding as well as it used to
5954087 thats a fact and it is pretty frustrating but that is the way it is
5954088 these measures are competitive reasonable and balanced so with this new tax the government will be able to improve education and health services and make investments that will create more jobs in other sectors of the economic and improve livelihoods of zambian citizen
5954089 i do not speak on behalf of government or the chamber of mines in zambia but coupled with the increasing fuel prices the operations of mines will be affected as for the lumwana mine we have not started operations but there are already changes to the development agreements i hope we will stick to the old agreement with government on taxes
5954090 we have put in the largest investment in this project in excess of 800 million to develop this mine the total investment is expected to come up to over 1 billion so you should understand that we are a business
5954091 the general situation of moroccos prison inmates especially those on death row is absolutely catastrophic and inhumane
5954092 humidity is causing serious illnesses such as asthma skin and eye diseases
5954093 the ever present threat of execution for those on death row is also causing serious mental illnesses
5954094 its up to the whim of the prison authorities whether medicines are authorised
5954095 and when they are issued it is always cheap medicines and weeks late
5954096 this is far from their families it really amounts to a form of collective punishment
5954097 prisoners are being served up food thats not even fit for sewer rats
5954098 there are actually no education and reintegration programmes for these inmates
5954099 once the price of oil goes down and you have no volume there is going to be budget crisis we have to protect our volume without which there is no trade
5954100 again if oil prices drop and we dont have the income for new projects we will have budget crisis
5954101 the industry is saying we need to invest more government should fund its own part adequately it will boost production
5954102 children have been born here in this camp they are now in secondary school why should we go back
5954103 funding is one of the major difficulties we face in the period that the refugees have lived in the country but i believe this also a responsibility of the international community to be much involved as well
5954104 our small loans are about k 500 000 each about us 140 now however weve switched to giving out agro loans in which we give out bags of fertilizer during the planting season and are repaid in maize after the crops have been harvested
5954105 it is envisaged that the refugees grow enough food to sustain themselves and sell the surplus food
5954106 i now own a bakery and i have been able to pay back the loan i got
5954107 we have found out that refugees can be very reliable when given the right tools education and support
5954108 our goal will be to protect and re settle those refugees as unhcr we think re settling them is a primarily tool we can used to protect them refugees

5954110 i left two other brothers there in tanzania who are married and with children and who must also get a share of this land
5954111 i have started making bricks i think it will take me 14 days to get them ready and if i build a house i will try to work and live as best as i can while waiting for my case to be settled
5954112 i am surprised to find that i am not even authorised to use a classroom while waiting to build my house when there is a disaster people seek shelter in schools yet they have no pity for us
5954113 others returnees find that the government used them their land for social infrastructure take the urban centre of nyanzalac for instance it was built on peoples land
5954114 logic would dictate that the new occupant vacates the land and return it to the owner but it is not as simple as it seems
5954115 some were given title deeds to the land others have exploited it for more than 30 years and under burundian law this entitles them to the land others have lived on the land for generations and simply have nowhere to go
5954116 my land was given to a senior army officer when i returned home i was forced out i had left a whole plantation of palm oil but i accepted not to claim it just to save my life and was given another piece of land in nyanzalac
5954117 now that the owner of this land is back they are telling me to share the small piece with him or leave it if the occupant of my original land leaves then i will leave this one
5954118 now they come and force us out overnight that is not the way it should be done
5954119 we only sensitise them telling them to share land whenever possible but it is not always easy
5954120 if the land issue is not dealt with adequately it can be the source of potential violence
5954121 the security council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation wherever whenever and by whomsoever committed

5954146 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats of the 21st century
5954147 we believe it is in the united states interest that all of these emerging powers and others assume a greater stake in promoting international peace and respect for human rights including through their more constructive participation in key global institutions
5954148 this is a significant enhancement in the content and placement of india over the 2004 democratic platform
5954149 the obama platform had put india into the category of a rising global power as opposed to the often expressed hyphenated relationship vis vis pakistan
5954150 this is a strong statement on the importance of us indian relations and on indias rising global power status in conjunction with china russia brazil etc putting it into the category of emerging global powers
5954151 the greatest threat to the security of the afghan people and the american people lies in the tribal region on pakistan where terrorists train plot attacks and strike into afghanistan and move back across the border
5954152 stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the north atlantic treaty organisation including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to better secure the border to take out terrorist camps and to crack down on cross border insurgents
5954153 we must help pakistan develop its own counter terrorism and counter insurgency capacity
5954154 we will invest in the long term development of the pashtun border region so that the extremists programme of hate is met with an agenda of hope
5954155 ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
5954156 we will significantly increase non military aid to the pakistani people and sustain it for a decade while ensuring that the military assistance we provide is actually used to fight extremists

5954191 we now believe that an unidentified male rented a room from the couple on or about 1 august
5954192 on 3 or 4 august mr zhen routinely contacted his mother in china via telephone and informed her that he had taken on a new lodger
5954193 he informed his mother that the new lodger was a student and that he came from the jinzhou area of dalian city
5954194 we have no further information to identify the lodger and enquiries to trace him have so far failed
5954195 we urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation and to eliminate him from our inquiries

5954471 kalau inflasi memang cukup banyak mendapat sorotan tapi saya sudah bertemu dengan bapak gubernur bi dia bilang cukup optimistis dan punya skenario mencapai target tersebut
5954472 ini mencerminkan sikp reaktif pemerintah di satu sisi ini bisa bernilai poitif dan menyiratkan optimisme terhadap pelaku ekonomi namun di sisi lain ini sinyal yang terlalu optimistis di tengah tingginya harga minyak dunia ini dapat memberi harapan semu bahwa tidak akan terjadi kenaikan bbm yang seringkai jadi bumerang bagi pemerintah sendiri di tengah ketidakjelasan kebijakan energi nasional

5954571 were growing up and we all have such huge dreams we want to fulfill but i would be on board to do a fourth movie definitely
5954572 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
5954573 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying
5954574 you make a movie with some people you become friends over the process of making this movie and then you go your own way
5954575 even by disney channel standards this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun
5954576 there wasnt time to do it any other way albers says since disney had to gather requirements features and content and then come up with a production schedule
5954577 by taking a pool of equipment and dedicate it to the event and move it around instead of having to go through a deployment and purchasing cycle makes us more agile
5954578 so we were able to spread our load and use 25 different machines that werent at a peak time basically by doing that we were able to hold the peak load and there were no incremental capital costs
5954579 using the cdn for large scale assets like video delivery is the stated practice today no matter who youre talking to says albers
5954580 cdn is the key component in that value chain what were adding to that is ability to measure and optimize the cdn as that market and service commoditize
5954581 going forward were now very well positioned to leverage growing this environment
5954582 thats the advantage of virtualization technology she says using a combination of load balancing and cdn and corralling underused servers
5954583 having the ability to reallocate server capacity that already exists is a lot easier and more time efficient for the company thats providing the content says posey

5954587 through the disney difference of creativity imagination and innovation we will continue to work closely with our valued travel trade network to delight and surprise their customers
5954588 human beings both want to and in a deeper way need to feel a sense of being autonomous when someone else begins to seduce you into behaving with an offer of a reward it takes away your sense of being autonomous now you are doing it for someone else external rewards and punishments are counterproductive when it comes to activities that are meaningful tasks that telegraph something about a persons intellectual abilities generosity courage or values people will voluntarily perform intellectually arduous work for example because it gives them pleasure to solve a puzzle or win a game of wits it is easy to offer a reward but it is not easy to help people find their own motivation
5954589 machines like google know something about us as human beings that we really dont want to know that we are not individuals if you like this then you will like that so google is a paradox it gives us the feeling we are wild and free individuals powerfully reinforcing an idea of us as heroic figures in the consumer age yet at the same time it is powerfully proving the opposite that we are completely predictable
5954590 the are relatively few games that have exploited bluetooth in this way but one such is you who from age0 which provides a simple game premise to help initiate a meeting after scanning for other users running the application and inviting a person to play the game the first player acts as a mystery person who then provides clues about their appearance to the second player who builds up a picture on their mobile phone screen after a set number of clues have been given the players phones alert revealing both players locations and identities obviously the game play is quite limited and effectively non competitive which is unlikely to result in repeated game play therefore it is closer to the nokia sensor than a game
5954591 weight watchers is an rpg think about it as with an rpg you roll a virtual character manage your inventory and resources and try to achieve a goal weight watchers points function precisely like hit points each bite of food does damage until youve used up your daily amount so you sleep and start all over again play well and you level up by losing weight and the more you play it the more you discover interesting combinations of the rules that arent apparent at first

5954598 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5954599 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5954600 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5954601 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5954602 the organisers did a good job though and the assistance both immediately after the accident and here at the hospital in trier was very good the ford focus proved to be very strong and the seat absorbed the impact quite well

5954624 any ways that we can remove duplication make it a more streamlined and effective system and then sit down and have the discussions about funding
5954625 were certainly more inclined to support them if the government can provide guarantees around the public health system but having said that we havent seen those guarantees yet
5954626 so we want to see a strong public health system built in australia or re established in australia

5954634 it is difficult to think of anything which would serve the dissident cause better than a shoot to kill policy
5954635 it is also disturbing that we have anyone involved in policing at any level who cant work that out for himself
5954636 it is precisely because we drew a line under that sort of so called policing that we were able to win such wide cross community support for a new beginning in policing
5954637 it is precisely for the same reason that the dissidents are trying so hard to target the police to split them off from the community to drive them back into armoured vehicles heavy armaments and fortified barracks
5954638 unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5954639 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing

5954769 marvel publishing is grateful to stephen for taking the time out of his busy schedule to talk about the dark tower comic series and comic books as a whole
5954770 were excited that this interview offers a chance to introduce this phenomenal epic and medium of entertainment to nprs listeners as well as reward loyal dark tower fans with some highly entertaining radio
5954771 the response to stephen kings dark tower comic book series has been phenomenal
5954772 dark tower comics represent a creative perfect storm of sorts and i cant imagine future installments without every last one of them
5954773 jae lees vision of mid world is beautiful and terrifying and ethereal all at once richard isanove continues to prove he might well be the best colorist in the industry
5954774 im immensely intrigued and enjoying this series and cant wait for the next issue to see what happens next
5954775 this series definitely offers just as strong an example of how well written prose a tightly woven story and beautiful artwork can all come together to make something extremely powerful
5954776 the qualities that they already have in abundance quick wits bravery and a steady gun hand
5954777 well i could tell you but what fun would that be
5954778 the war is going to be a major factor and will continue to build as the series progresses
5954779 yes but if i went into detail they wouldnt be surprises
5954780 whether it will have any impact at all or simply set the scene for other elements in the world of the dark tower remains to be seen
5954781 peter davids script is slowly deftly turning robin furths story plot into something that will no doubt fit nicely into kings already established gunslinger mythology
5954782 submit it to whatever comics award committee you wish to right now it deserves an award or two
5954783 harder slijt dan aanvankelijk werd ingeschat er moest daarom een beroep worden gedaan op onder meer de wapens van de natres
5954784 as a lifelong fan of marvel comic books and as an adult reader whos seen comics
5954785 i love jae lees work and i think this is going to be a dynamite partnership frankly i cant wait
5954786 stephen king is a true literary master we are thrilled beyond words to have him join marvel on this exciting project the millions of dark tower fans are in for a real treat and im sure many more will soon be hooked on this epic series through this historic comic project
5954787 the level of excitement and talent that stephen king brings to the world of comic books is electrifying were proud and honored to be a part of what promises to be an industry defining event
5954788 the really amazing thing about this book has been the great welcoming reaction weve had
5954789 we knew the book was going to be great from the moment we started getting pages in everybody delivered the best work of their career jaes pencils richards paints peters dialogue robins plots everybody was firing on all cylinders so we were never worried about the quality level we went out of our way and will continue to do so to make every issue a great piece of work in its own right packed with extra features like maps and original articles by robin furth so were really happy to see these issues sell so well and this last issue has a full 35 pages of comic plus extras
5954790 much of the series power has come from the near flawless way the talent involved has captured the look feel and essence of stephen kings original novels as well as the overall air of mystery and surrealism that hovers over these early years in rolands epic saga
5954791 fantastic each panel is so meticulously detailed and beautifully rendered that you could just look at them all day
5954792 with over half of the story arc done i can honestly say that gunslinger born is a success
5954793 dark tower is a spectacular achievement both in terms of narration and visuals this is one of the best books of the year
5954794 sales for the dark tower gunslinger born premiere hc are great
5954795 it is without a doubt a beautiful piece of work
5954796 this is another visual masterpiece on all levels for jae lee
5954797 its a very very auspicious beginning for the dark tower in comic book form
5954798 lees work is excellent throughout maintaining a sweeping cinematic feel to every image
5954799 the gunslinger born is the perfect starting point for those who think comics contain nothing but men in spandex costumes and masks
5954800 having the fewest wants i am nearest to the gods
5954801 the response we have received from retailers participating in the midnight opening has been overwhelmingly positive the mainstream attention it has drawn to the direct market and to this first issue is unrivaled in the recent history of the industry should this prove as successful as it appears it will be i think well see more of this type of mainstream event happening in the future
5954802 i cant draw a stick figure that looks like a person its very gratifying to see this happen
5954803 we kept going it cant be this easy it just cant its a really wholly creative and collaborative environment hopefully well do more
5954804 thats a question for the people working on it its a question for robin
5954805 if something came up in my mind these are the people id go to
5954806 i dont really see characters its like im behind their eyes
5954807 im a really instinctual writer i dont work from an outline
5954808 the difference between me and jae is jae holds everything back and i let everything go
5954809 we might toss it into the mix dont mistake us for people who know where were going
5954810 no when you work on a book you get in that mindset
5954811 as a lifelong fan of marvel comic books and as an adult reader whos seen comics come of age and take their rightful place in the world of fantasy and science fiction im excited to be a part of rolands new incarnation
5954812 stephen king is a true literary master we are thrilled beyond words to have him join marvel on this exciting project the first visualization of the dark tower characters and stories in the sequential arts medium the millions of dark tower fans are in for a real treat and im sure many more will soon be hooked on this epic series through this historic comic project
5954813 the level of excitement and talent that stephen king brings to the world of comic books is electrifying were proud and honored to be a part of what promises to be an industry defining event

5954815 his appearance will be a huge thrill for dark tower enthusiasts comic book fans and convention goers alike marvel is extremely grateful for this opportunity and aims to make this convention a landmark event for all of graphic fiction storytelling
5954816 he came to the city of north hollywood and the city of hollywood picked up these victims and lured them into believing that they were going to be rich wealthy their family was going to be wealthy they were going to be models successful and he sexually assaulted them
5954817 they were vulnerable some may argue that they were na ve but it takes a great deal of courage for them to come forward and put their reputations on the line knowing that their actions are going to be scrutinized

5954829 all i can say is that when i was a young rider coming through the ranks i remember seeing jason queally who id trained with win that gold in sydney
5954830 i saw him standing on the podium and i knew then that he was clean i knew hed won an olympic gold medal clean and that i was the day i thought wow if he can do it i can do it sadly there are always going to be suspicions that this hasnt come out of the blue but its been 12 years in the making
5954831 what was surprising to me was not that we stepped up a whole new level because there are reasons for that our preparation and our planning it seems surprising that other nations have underperformed the gap has almost been exaggerated by some teams that have not been able to raise their game since the world championships
5954832 i caught his pad but obviously it wasnt hard enough or the judges missed it
5954833 i thought i had a good chance going into that last round but obviously it didnt go the right way i did well because i was up against the world silver medallist but he was there to be beaten and im a bit gutted that ive lost its great experience for london 2012 but i wanted to go a bit further
5954834 i think michael performed quite well in his first major tournament
5954835 he was quite nervous at the beginning of the first round but its one of the best performances from michael michael is only 18 years old so while we expected a good performance this is about his preparation for 2012 michael will be a very big surprise in 2012 and we will have a very strong team

5954874 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5954875 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5954876 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment

5954886 i was proud she finally got a gold medal and we can both say were olympic champions
5954887 he chow told me to stop take a second gather myself and try to calm down
5954888 i was just too shaken up the more mistakes you make in practice the more you start worrying
5954889 i was getting too worried but he took me out of it i sat down and calmed down and got back and did one more routine then went out to compete
5954890 it was totally a confident performance that she showed the audience and the judges i am so proud of her
5954891 i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling i could have done better
5954892 i wanted to do the best i could and i think i did

5954963 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole
5954964 she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5954965 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here
5954966 this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5954967 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish
5954968 rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual
5954969 maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick

5954977 people who were approved for a grant scheme have been informed in recent days they cannot go ahead with their proposed work
5954978 there is no funding shortfall the 71 4 million we gave this year exceeds last years allocation by almost 100 000
5954979 will be dealt with in the light of any savings emerging later in the year in other local authority areas
5954980 cash starved local authorities can only get more cash to pay for these schemes if other local authorities do not spend all of their allocation with massive waiting lists this is highly unlikely
5954981 have not been affected by the cutbacks and will get their promised grants
5954982 the people who avail of these grants are the most vulnerable in irish society and should not be made to pay for the economic mismanagement of this government

5954992 hij zoekt en vindt in eigen land mooie landschappen hij heeft behoefte aan beweging wandelen maar ook fietsen mag hij graag wat hij ook plezierig vindt is een goed dak boven zijn hoofd en een goede lokale keuken de grote trend van de laatste paar jaar is de zogenaamde gezondheidsvakantie razend populair zijn wat dat betreft de vele wellnessaanbiedingen
5954993 voor een duitser zijn de vakantieweken de mooiste weken van het jaar

5954995 deze kleine bodemdiertjes zijn in ons land relatief slecht onderzocht maar om een nieuwe soort te ontdekken in zon stedelijk stukje natuur is wel erg bijzonder

5955002 ondanks de hoge verwachtingen hier en daar hebben de acties in de aanloop naar en tijdens het ek voetbal niet tot hogere verkopen geleid
5955003 hoewel je op cuba veel oude amerikaanse autos aantreft kun je ze niet zo maar importeren
5955004 wij hebben een uitgebreid netwerk in de vs en europa vandaar dat arton vrijwel alles van amerikaanse makelij kan leveren natuurlijk is het afhankelijk van het type auto maar klanten kunnen in een tijdsbestek vari rend van een week tot enkele maanden hun bestelling ontvangen
5955005 in veel gevallen gaat het om groot soepel en stil rijden want dat zijn de kenmerken van amerikaanse autos voor veel amerikanen is een wagen namelijk een vervoersmiddel en geen heilige koe anders is het als je een corvette aanschaft corvette rijden is meer een way of life

5955011 they identified that they had a much greater reliance on it and needed it to respond much more quickly than it had been
5955012 the need for mobile computing to be able to access information anywhere at anytime and to submit audit reports is extremely high we needed to integrate with our customers who demand we provide information back to them
5955013 i arrived in 2003 and we had something like 15 single tape units in the data centre because every time they put in a new system they put in another tape unit to back it up there were individual upss and there were desktops in the data centre my absolute number one pet hate in a computer room so we started a complete rebuilding process
5955014 the number of well considered details the visual approach and the very comprehensive presentation materials lifted this concept easily into the top category
5955015 the size of our projects has increased which has given us more stability in our earnings profile
5955016 three years ago oakton wouldnt have had a 5 million project today we have five of those and three or four projects greater than 10 million
5955017 its part of our strategy to get into the larger project market
5955018 that allows us to be price competitive with the larger companies it doesnt replace our traditional mid size project space but it incrementally adds to our revenue profile
5955019 we will be looking for companies that provide services similar to ours and could bolster our location in some areas
5955020 i thank you not only for the box you sent which was very much enjoyed by my young soldiers but also for sharing a part of yourself and home with someone you do not even know
5955021 so again thank you for your package for me and my men but more importantly thank you for reaching out to the people here and showing an oppressed people what grace is
5955022 every week there are great stories and testimonies of our military members making first time decisions in their life to trust god for salvation rededicate their life to christ and grow in their faith while in the desert
5955023 i was a little choked up as i opened up each box to see an endless supply of beanie babies school supplies candy gum erasers notebook paper toy cars toys for the boys and the girls crayons snacks clothes
5955024 it really makes a difference in our lives here to know that kind hearted people such as yourself are thinking of us and providing us with the things we need to make it through these long deployments
5955025 they see americans and they know what that means opportunity a helping hand grace through gifts sounds odd but i cant think of another way to put it
5955026 you have no idea how happy the childrens faces are when we hand them the goodies you send us the hearts and minds of iraqi adults and children are being won because of each and every one of your donations
5955027 its great to drive around and see kids sprint to the road with smiles and thumbs up when they see a u s patrol coming
5955028 i want to give praise and thanks to my lord and savior jesus christ for touching each and every one of you and for allowing you to send those letters and post cards we are been blessed by all the support we have received from each and every one of you
5955029 all of us are proud to serve our country and know that it could not be possible without the support of our fellow countrymen thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all that you have given us
5955030 we have been conducting patrols and searches in or around the area the guys really appreciate all the support we have received so far it has amazed me how support complete strangers have been to us they are a lot more supportive than most of our families
5955031 well i think itd be real funny if i put a bullet into your brain hahahahahaha
5955032 well i think you conservatives need to be rounded up and put into camps
5955033 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
5955034 an incredible impossible mad place i tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and i have lived and worked in it is part of our dream world

5955037 it would have been nice to have more than nine candidates but we were prepared by the consultant that there are a lot of superintendents out there that are retiring
5955038 i want to personally thank each and every member of the council and city administrator david schmidt in particular for all the extra hours they devoted to hammering out this budget document
5955039 its being approved at the county state and national level
5955040 well be looking at how to do the least amount of damage
5955041 we were shown the room where packages were made up to be sent to pows in the various parts of germany important was the fact that these packages were sent under the rubric of fake charity organizations
5955042 put into these special packages under these fake foundations were compasses saws escape maps other items such as pairs of wire cutters
5955043 the baseball would have a radio transmitter inside the cribbage board as you moved the pieces you could listen to the channels of the bbc the deck of playing cards if you steamed the pieces apart in between each card would be a little piece of a silk escape map
5955044 i remember growing up in the 1960s my father loved the tv show hogans heroes
5955045 especially when they were hiding radios in coffee pots and things like that
5955046 they had to use different stationery for these different people and then had to remember so whenever betsy was writing to her boyfriend it had to be betsys handwriting and betsys stationery and you can imagine as the scope of this grew that it had to have rigid control over this or you could you know a lot was at stake
5955047 escluderebbero che il medesimo trasportato possa agire nei confronti del vero responsabile del danno cos come previsto dal sistema degli artt 1917 2043 e 2054 del codice civile

5955050 we have a high degree of confidence the railroad will be constructed on time and hopefully within budget
5955051 why what if the railroad goes away and now we have a bridge to maintain we wanted to protect the long term interests of our residents
5955052 and we wanted to put this on a fast track we dont want to be accused of slowing down the mine
5955053 weve been working for 20 25 years to get a coal mine developed
5955054 the support we have received both from yellowstone and musselshell counties has been outstanding
5955055 it takes a lot of work to bring these agreements to fruition
5955056 sometimes you just have to admit that you didnt do your homework as well as you might have thought
5955057 this is really good news it was more than i expected
5955058 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
5955059 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish
5955060 love compassion and a huge feeling of pain for those who got a hard hand in life oozed through the gravelly voice of ronnie drew
5955061 elevate the words of song to an almost sacred mantra
5955062 i was married to a lady i dont know how she put up with me so long i wouldnt have put up with me
5955063 she kept me alive she was a great one for helping the lame ducks and there wasnt a lamer one than me
5955064 my dad enjoyed life to the full and enjoyed quality in everything in conversation in food in cigars in wine in dress but he didnt have a huge amount of respect for money
5955065 he only thought of it as a way to make life bearable and enjoyable
5955066 ive personally been involved in five of these but this was the steepest most technical spot ive ever had to be inserted into
5955067 im proud of everybody because that was a rough place up there
5955068 this was a very difficult and dangerous rescue and demonstrated spectacular skill on the part of the rescuers and pilots it is also an excellent example of interagency cooperation in the true spirit of montana
5955069 related to rabbits actually a pika would fit in your hand although he wouldnt stay there very long
5955070 because they just might be the canary in the coal mine to warn us about climate change
5955071 the entire park ecosystem is undergoing an incredibly rapid shift
5955072 and some species wont fare very well the first thing we need to be doing from a research standpoint is gathering this kind of baseline data because without the baseline you cant measure the change
5955073 its an opportunity to make a real connection with the public and to educate them about science and how science works
5955074 under the influence of passion prejudice or any other arbitrary factor
5955075 our experience tells us that juries have minds of their own and a theory such as that propounded by the defense team was as good as anything we can think of given the circumstances of the case
5955076 it didnt seem to be a big item at the time but it passed by a hefty margin
5955077 all concerns are special i just want to help manage the county with input from the people who live here
5955078 the three commissioners are solid citizens who are doing the best they can
5955079 i decided to run because i felt there was a lack of leadership and communication in the current administration
5955080 its not whats been done but how its been done
5955081 the voters have signaled they want some kind of change
5955082 what it tells me is that we have gotten a lot done but that we have a lot more to do
5955083 we used to be counting ballots until 2 or 3 in the morning
5955084 now were usually done by 9 or 10 i love the new system
5955085 ill miss seeing them on the road on their bikes they were always trying to catch butterflies and things like that
5955086 like most third graders she was happy go lucky with the world by the tail
5955087 teachers are also parents and you cant help thinking of how special your own kids are when something like this happens
5955088 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5955089 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5955090 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5955091 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5955092 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5955093 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5955094 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5955095 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body

5955097 i heard this tremendous boom and it shook the whole building
5955098 i ran out and the trees were all on fire i was just shaking
5955099 my employees told me they could feel the percussion of the blast
5955100 there was so much fire that you couldnt tell anything and i wasnt about to get close because this fire was really going
5955101 the glass was broken out of the whole car so the fire went extremely quick
5955102 the fire was going awful quick in a very short time and that doesnt happen in an accidental fire
5955103 it is an urgent need as we tackle changes in the international economic situation as well

5955107 mom has a history with this kid but some of the older boys statements are disturbing
5955108 my daughter is a good mother she took very good care of her kids
5955109 i couldnt stand him because he beat my daughter there always was something wrong about him
5955110 the kids were asleep so she took a shower and made dinner
5955111 my daughter tried to give him cpr but that man just went into the bedroom and closed the door
5955112 i want him to go to jail because in my heart soul and every breath of my body i know he killed that child

5955118 community leader pierre eksteen who is in charge of a school support network for children
5955119 told reporters outside the deserted school grounds that satanic music was probably the cause of the attack
5955120 he came here camouflaged as the guys from slipknot we know the wrong kind of music and drugs have bad effects young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music
5955121 with community leaders as dumb as this its no wonder kids go crazy dysfunctional kids will always find a reason to be screw ups charles manson claimed to kill for god and george bush does it for democracy satan does not in fact write music although he does on the odd occasion do backup vocals for celine dion
5955122 i wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound i wanna push my face in and feel the swoon i wanna dig inside find a little bit of me cuz the line gets crossed when you dont come clean
5955123 the state of the nation violation a broken promise is as good as a lie the hell is humongous the devils among us and we will burn because we wont unite we wont witness anymore freedom where is anybody do we need em i would rather fight than let another die were the problem but were also the solution all hope is gone
5955124 nothing i would have listened because no one else did
5955125 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5955126 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group
5955127 benni showed good leadership as a senior player his experience shone through we played all four afcon qualifiers in june and lacked leadership in attack now we have rediscovered that leadership
5955128 the players showed their true fighting character i was able to play my best team tonight and got a good result the first half we lost a lot of shape but we got our act together in the second by playing to our strengths and that is keeping the ball on the ground playing tap tap soccer
5955129 its our responsibility to do whatever we can to avoid giving any unhinged disturbed person incentive to go off the deep end
5955130 what they are trying to do is play a game here
5955131 they made the business decision to create an ideological network we didnt they were the ones that got in bed with the bush administration so that most of the time where did the bush administration officials come out and make their points fox news we didnt you brought it up but its a great story because you cant trust a word they say
5955132 the national parks in general and glacier park in particular have become the poster child for climate change and that means they really are stepping up as leaders in both research and education
5955133 is were going to have to make new choices this is huge and rapid change far faster than we can account for through natural cycles and it leaves the mountain ecosystem very vulnerable
5955134 and its prompting the park to step up and lead by example
5955135 people want to know when the glaciers will finally disappear
5955136 but if the parks going to be an educator and not just the evidence then man theyd better have their own house in order before they take on that role
5955137 climate change is the biggest challenge our land management agencies have ever faced
5955138 and glacier has become a real leader there are some really visionary thinkers in the park service and the hub for that thinking is glacier park
5955139 no beginning is too small and every individual makes a difference the problem we have now is that no single snowflake ever feels responsible for the avalanche
5955140 theres nobody out there and nobody is getting in i hope that happiness finds its way to your little house while you were sleeping i i played a ghost in a sheet when our frames collide theres nothing left to be theres nobody out there the rain is just starting to fall you get some reset now youll worry yourself thin i hope that happiness finds its way to your little house while you were sleeping i i played a ghost in a sheet when our frames collide theres nothing left to be the skeletal wings of birds ill take the stairs the ghosts of tiny animals with the tiniest of feet the forecast is going down a storm
5955141 i mean looking at his family from a distance and wondering if he is ever going to see them again
5955142 its tragic to see an 86 year old man in poor health being carted off like that
5955143 i will do everything in my power to help the cincinnati bengals win a super bowl
5955144 at the end of the day the owner obviously has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not and mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asked that we do the best job we can to prepare him and get him ready to play football and if he can be a positive influence on this football team and help us to win games and be productive as a receiver and get him better as a receiver and we feel that way after the suspension is over and he has a chance to earn a spot so thats what he asked me to do and thats what we are going to do mike makes decisions with my input and so forth all the time but every decision made in this building is ultimately his decision
5955145 someone ate jeremi johnson and then showed up to camp claiming to be our fullback
5955146 het is als bij een partituur de juiste instrumenten en partijen komen op het juiste moment bij elkaar
5955147 door zowel de architectuur als het stedenbouwkundig plan in handen van een beperkte groep ontwerpers te houden is de samenhang tussen de verschillende onderdelen in de buurt toegenomen
5955148 onze opdrachtgever wonenbreburg wilde huurwoningen door ons bureau ontworpen qua esthetiek niet onder laten doen voor duurdere koopwoningen
5955149 de laagbouw zorgt voor vrij zicht op de omliggende bossen daarnaast is de heilige koe uit het straatbeeld gehaald door ruimte op eigen terrein te cre ren de berkenboom stond model voor de gebruikte kleuren grijs en wit voor de gevels bruingrijs voor het natuursteen in de tuin
5955150 mensen staan soms met hun neuzen tegen het glas gedrukt dat is voor mij een bevestiging dat ik een prachtig huis bezit
5955151 het is een statig gebouw en de glazen balkons geven een mooi effect maar wij houden van een meer fleurige uitstraling
5955152 veel bewoners leven op als de kinderen op bezoek komen
5955153 je ziet ze genieten van alle aandacht dat is wederzijds de kinderen hebben minstens evenveel lol soms staan medewerkers van het zorgcentrum zelfs versteld een tijd geleden gingen we met de groepen naar buiten bewoners dronken koffie en aten cake aan een picknicktafel plotseling zat een van de opas met de kinderen op de glijbaan normaal gesproken is hij niet zo actief we horen vaak van onze collegas van koningsvoorde terug dat bewoners echt opvrolijken door het contact met kinderen
5955154 ze hebben geen oog voor leeftijdsverschil of verschijnselen van dementie sommige kinderen schrikken in het begin van mensen die hard praten maar daar zijn ze zo aan gewend het is ook afhankelijk van de reactie van medewerkers een rustige benadering van onze kant geeft kinderen vertrouwen
5955155 de kinderen voeren haar terug naar haar werk ze herinnert zich alles de weg naar haar kamer op de eerste verdieping moet je haar echter niet vragen die vergeet ze steeds
5955156 she wanted to win and she would run so hard that after some of her races she just practically would lay down for three or four days
5955157 she would run very very hard and give it all she had every time
5955158 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5955159 we are truly blessed that she was a part of our life and we are deeply saddened by her passing
5955160 her win was a very romantic kentucky derby win and i dont think the fans ever forgot her
5955161 we have always thought that codex should have been taken down
5955162 we did what we thought was the right thing to do it didnt work out in our favor
5955163 this woman she was african american she gestured for me to go ahead of her in line
5955164 i told her ive never been more than 35 miles from manhattan she seemed surprised when i said that do you believe that im really not sure what she meant by that
5955165 i would never eat more than one banana in my entire life
5955166 armed madhouse penguin 2006 his first reports appeared on guardian newspapers author of another
5955167 oh a goodbye party huh where they headed im a travel writer
5955168 make it work no i dont make it work thats why im outside this bar on a sunday night
5955169 at which point my new travel writing friend pretends to lift an invisible small dog by its harness and toss it over his shoulder
5955170 can you believe that he just picked up that dog like a bag held it over his shoulder and that little bulldog was just sitting there with his legs straight out in front of him looking up at the sky you could tell he was just thinking what the hell is this whered the ground go bulldog backpack
5955171 shit i forgot my cigarettes upstairs those elevators are ridiculous you got any extras
5955172 i moved here from russia when i was eight years old
5955173 lived in the city with my family since then you ever been
5955174 yeah i know what you mean i speak spanish but not really except when you get drunk all of a sudden youre fluent and if you add drugs to the mix not only are you fluent youre a poet a fucking poet
5955175 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
5955176 its not just for me but for the people you drive
5955177 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
5955178 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
5955179 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
5955180 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
5955181 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
5955182 how dare you turn my words against me thats why i hate you and thats why i love you man you remember and you care
5955183 if i put my arm around a transexual does that make me gay
5955184 boris honey its mother im trying to use your computer and you left that warcraft game on it again oh and your father says you clogged the upstairs toilet again theres a plunger under the sink for when you get back from the comic book store thank you sweetums
5955185 umm except im black and a transexual and im with boris
5955186 one of the difficulties with that is its not just a straightforward matter of administering it its not just a matter of a single shot in the arm it would be preferable that it would be beached
5955187 assuming its separated from its mother from saturday we are at about day five
5955188 ive got to catch quite a bit these last 10 to 15 games
5955189 i am going to be in there 80 percent of these games behind the plate
5955190 its been hinted all around without anyone outright saying it
5955191 i am starting to feel better i went through a funk there at 20 to 25 at bats but i am feeling better at the plate now
5955192 it happens its one of those things i felt awkward at the plate and tried to work through it i did make good contact
5955193 i am trying to get back on track if i do go up in september ill have very limited at bats
5955194 its pretty much the same situation i dont know what is going to happen next year
5955195 there is a 50 50 chance of me being in this organization next year
5955196 we hope that fans of the worlds most popular board game will enjoy buying selling and trading real estate from around the globe in the new monopoly game that they created with their votes
5955197 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet

5955205 the biggest amp best show in l a for the money
5955206 ya never know whos gonna show up and jam on stage
5955207 the biggest amp best show in l a for the money
5955208 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
5955209 in the ongoing battle to let us eat dinner in peace without being interrupted by amazingly annoying telemarketer blather and in this case the even more infuriating recorded telemarketing drivel the federal trade commission today basically
5955210 pressed 1 to talk to a representative about yor chance to lock in a low rate on your credit card
5955211 we provide a valuable service that people like and it is not annoying
5955212 it is a question of survival how do you survive and therefore i dont think it is very good to think that we can remain free the question is can we survive free it is not about survival as a destroyed state but survival as a state which is viable where people can exist happily under the present circumstances freedom is not easy to sustain
5955213 should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than we inherited
5955214 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5955215 if youve got book sales of 25 million then you qualify
5955216 if i tell you a joke can i earn some change
5955217 guys sorry im late if i make you laugh can i earn some change
5955218 i got two dollars and fifty cents from the six of them im not really feeling it today
5955219 the things that i have in my life i get based on other peoples idiosyncrasies
5955220 and theres no counting on it thats it theres no option if you laugh i eat end of story
5955221 i recognized that i could have a pity party poor me poor me poor me or i could literally get up off my ass and make other people laugh
5955222 and by making other people laugh i dont cry if you make someone laugh you change their life even if only for a moment
5955223 i give people the opportunity to have their own window of laughter
5955224 with me say whatever the hell you want to say you want to be racist be racist i dont give a fuck
5955225 let me tell you something if i had a gun or a knife if i was robbing stealing or begging i think id be degrading black people a little bit more than if i was just telling a fucking joke i mean lets be realistic here im laughing at society
5955226 ive only seen him a couple times but hes funny he can turn it on and he can take whatever people throw at him hes just so funny
5955227 hes better than some of these other drunk guys that come in here they tell the worst jokes ive ever heard shit theyre all trying to become fucking comedians
5955228 anybody whos working deserves to be earning money hes not like the other bums asking for change hes funny i like him hes one of the local entertainers
5955229 there were eight million people in new york city maxed out with tourists thats about 13 million if i make 100 people laugh and they each give me one dollar i make 100 a day 700 dollars a week where else do you want me to work
5955230 one of the staple reactions that i get is you dont look like you need change
5955231 im like look you bought a drink for a bitch you couldnt fuck and i bought a jacket im sorry its cold outside you got a hangover and im warm dont blame me why do you care what im wearing because if i remind you of you its too close
5955232 so why does it matter how i spend my money actually it does because you know what youll give me money and youll say heres some money do the right thing ill buy a shirt and a tie and the next person will say you dont need money you look too good if i bought drugs or if i bought liquor and i was on the side of the street like this
5955233 thats when you would say here thats when you need it
5955234 i have a phone and its got a radio and i got thirty minutes free for 30
5955235 i dont mind doing a comedy club every once and a while but they dont pay
5955236 i did joes pub big deal i did cbgbs big deal i did the bitter end big deal i did comedy village big deal so what does it change anything no youre funny have a drink
5955237 at some of those places i gotta pay to go in and then buy two drinks and if i get on stage theyll give me 10 back 30 bucks so i can hi and tell jokes to the same people i would see outside on the street
5955238 hes good hell just go right up to you and hell start talking to you and have a nice time with you hes a good person he deserves to be somewhere where everybody can really see him because he is talented he deserves that shot
5955239 he was doing jokes and then people were paying him
5955240 that i might be a homeless guy and i can still make a woman smile
5955241 all you need is a chance i dont understand why people can help you but they dont that makes no sense to me
5955242 people were paying big money to hear me speak and train their employees
5955243 he wasnt a vagrant i mean obviously he had a brain at some point if he can be this articulate at this stage where did that come from most of them cant put two words together they cant put two syllables together let alone a statement and with this guy you always got the impression that he came from somewhere
5955244 and maybe most of its true but i think hes a little crazy
5955245 i could never tell if the guy was legitimate or just really well prepped
5955246 that crowd over theres good for four dollars the blondes over there thats a five dollar crowd and thats a three dollar crowd because there are kids there these guys right here will give me two dollars and maybe 50 cents over there lets say 25 dollars and i havent even left this area
5955247 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
5955248 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
5955249 yes i think i would very much like to try that
5955250 o microblogging tornou se um novo nicho de informa o colaborativa
5955251 the alliance amp leicester a amp l bank has warned of
5955252 the a amp l board also recognises the risk that further shocks to the financial system created by unfavourable developments at other financial institutions could generate widespread general adverse sentiment towards financial groups like a amp l
5955253 the a amp l board has concluded therefore that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value and that the value to a amp l shareholders of the greater certainty provided by being part of a larger organisation is considerable
5955254 thousands of pounds raised by britons for the bbcs children in need charity could have been used to recruit and train the homegrown terrorists involved in the 7 7 terror attacks on london
5955255 some of the cash could also have been used to fund the propaganda activities of the suicide bombers who killed 52 people in july 2005 according to an investigation by bbc 2s newsnight
5955256 im incredibly concerned that we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago
5955257 any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
5955258 we take the trust that the public puts in bbc children in need and the fact that they provide us with their finding extremely seriously and im incredibly concerned
5955259 i can reassure the british public that we are very careful in who we fund and this allegation is a very rare one for us but one that causes a great deal of concern
5955260 the small grants made by bbc children in need to leeds community school were given in good faith in 1998 and 1999
5955261 although this is a serious matter we have not seen any evidence that the money they received was used for terrorist activity if bbc children in need has been a victim of fraud in this case it will be a matter for the police
5955262 bbc children in need distributes more than 30m in grants every year benefiting children and young people in the uk
5955263 well in the dog breeding world there are different levels of dogs border collies being the highest and chihuahuas being on the lower end of the scale it was probably cheaper to get chihuahuas
5955264 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
5955265 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
5955266 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
5955267 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots

5955278 my nightmare is 12 soccer moms on a jury trying to understand rules of engagement hostile intent and all the other things that confront a marine in combat
5955279 the powers that be havent let us give the correct input for what wed like this to be
5955280 i believe this officer did the best he could but unfortunately mistakes were made and we lacked confidence in the persuasiveness of our case
5955281 we still have a belief in eadys guilt which made for an agonizing decision
5955282 i expect that there will be shades of the truth told in a trial
5955283 but we rely on certain foundational things that someone is not going to tell a straight out lie this is very frustrating and disturbing
5955284 its just another tool well have to address any problems
5955285 the more openness you have the better it is for everybody
5955286 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5955287 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5955288 theyll find another fake issue to focus on and then another
5955289 politicians use the poor when its convenient to chant slogans but really its all about power

5955292 yeggs was a term used in the 30s which intimated crime partner if you read dashiell hammett well yeggs were loosely affiliated crime partners on the west side of manhattan specific to manhattan
5955293 youz got no yeggs youz got no shoes and all your voices dissipate in wild frenzy really late it seems they melt much worse than snow and as the mountains go they go because theyve fallen toward wonderment and when they go to satan not to job their final happy resting place is not with god in outer space that place but in the deep that cold hard pressured deep that cold unfeeling deep and dark and deep and dead except for me for i have lived within that deep before and loved within that deep before and nothing more

5955333 i had a few bone fragments floating around in my elbow joint causing inflammation there were also bone spurs that needed to be removed it has been ongoing for a while it reduced my flexibility in the right arm and if it was extended too much it would swell up and be useless for a few days until the inflammation went down
5955334 so it was a priority to get it fixed as soon as this last fight was over which is what we did dr sanders and young operated on it in las vegas on july 10 and removed the bone fragments and bone spurs
5955335 mostly because i am training on it so much but should be completely healed within the next few weeks i have been doing cardio and some grappling but havent been able to spar for some time i am trying to be ready by november but its a safer bet to say i will be fighting in december
5955336 i want to fight top contenders i have already fought burkman and davis so i want to move up from there and continue to test my abilities against the best
5955337 i am extremely motivated and excited to get back in the octagon mentally and physically i will be where i need to be to return to the aggressive explosive fighter that i used to be
5955338 after the okami fight i was immature professionally and let pressure and other issues cloud my mind i know i could have fought better but didnt and it handed me my greatest loss
5955339 after this instead of making up for it with a better fight against burkman i let issues effect that fight as well and again was disappointed in my performance it was a tough lesson to have to swallow but it matured me as a fighter
5955340 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
5955341 bishop odonohue writes of the failure of the catholic bishops of england and wales forthrightly to face the issues of homosexual activism as a body
5955342 disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree on a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
5955343 attempting to arrive at a consensus among bishops with sometimes divergent views episcopal conference statements and documents have a tendency to be often flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
5955344 i must admit that during my 15 years as a bishop i have increasingly come to share certain concerns about the relationship between individual bishops and the national conference
5955345 reluctance among the rest of the bishops to speak out on these issues
5955346 results often in the loss of the scandal and the folly of the gospel so that we are no longer the salt and leaven so urgently needed
5955347 confident courageous and prophetic bishops are vital for the well being of the church during this time of increasingly aggressive secularism
5955348 the passion to serve the lord is noticeably absent in many cases there seems to be at times a tiredness and reticence to preach the gospel
5955349 doctrinal and moral teaching in their collaboration with secular agencies
5955350 im thinking in particular of agencies with a responsibility for education or economic development the staff of these agencies are often in a position to witness to the truth of the churchs teaching on say the theology of the body with its positive refutation of pre marital sex safe sex or artificial birth control in their dealings with government departments and committees
5955351 there must be no back peddling on these issues just because certain truths are unwelcome in the corridors of power
5955352 we have talked too much and done too little we have witnessed over the past forty years a growing crisis in the catholic understanding or self identity of the church have we forgotten what it is to be catholic
5955353 the maturity of the pope john paul ii generation will lead i hope to a resurgence of orthodox committed adults in the church gradually renewing vocations to the priesthood religious life and marriage
5955354 what hes saying is what weve all been saying for years but now its a bishop saying it we can use it and quote it and build on it so yes its a very good thing

5955361 his win over thomas denny was a crucial test for him he needed to prove he could make weight and pass californias stringent anti marijuana drug policy diaz easily made weight and passed the drug test
5955362 his recent wins have convinced elitexc that his next fight should be a rematch with k j noons at the oct 4 cbs show however it is still unclear if k j s camp will take the fight
5955363 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere
5955364 i dont understand it this fight on cbs is maximum exposure and the opportunity for maximum sponsorship dollars way more than he could make on showtime at this point i question his management
5955365 we believe in k j as our champion for some reason his camp is not coming straight out and saying no but they are making it very difficult to make it happen
5955366 his manager doesnt want us talking to him directly who knows what k j even knows about the situation but his management is holding us hostage

5955371 turkey believes international law is 100 on it side thats why it took the particular intervention actions that it did and that is why there is no need to go to court
5955372 our view is well known the presence of the turkish occupational forces and the turkish invasion cannot be legally based on the treaty of guarantee and their presence in cyprus is in any case illegal
5955373 international law is 100 on the side of cyprus that is why

5955386 whether obama survives now will depend on the most important and overlooked part of his speech the final section in which he challenged the public and especially the media to stow the sensationalism we can play reverend wrights sermons on every channel every day
5955387 and that is the existential challenge of 2008 whether we will have a big election or a small one will we have a serious conversation about the enormous problems confronting the country the wars the economic crisis the looming environmental cataclysm or will we allow the same old carnival of swift boats and sound bites the answer depends on the candidates of course and on the media where cynicism too often passes for insight but most of all it depends on you
5955388 this all goes back to the media and the negative impact that it has had on this election
5955389 the answer depends on the candidates of course and on the media where cynicism too often passes for insight but most of all it depends on you

5955391 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
5955392 how did you keep from laughing at this i look ridiculous
5955393 before i could react edward motioned for them to follow him toward the chicken coop and they were gone when he reappeared he was alone
5955394 i took another experimental bite i chewed twice uhg definitely bad i jumped up to spit it into the sink suddenly the chicken and oil smell was revolting
5955395 was it possible that he was still growing he had to be closer to seven feet than to six

5955397 yeah the party can start the best man finally made it

5955436 im hinblick auf das frankreich match ist das spiel gegen italien ein guter test denn die italiener sind genauso stark wie die franzosen

5955438 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5955439 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5955440 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5955441 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5955442 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5955443 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5955444 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5955445 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5955446 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5955447 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5955448 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now what what is it that i do i get a doctor i get a surgeon i get an oncologist what do i do
5955449 you know i really love living and i really love my life i knew from this moment on it was only going to be good and that was going to be coming
5955450 yeah im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say ive got to i have to get out there and and make this positive
5955451 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5955452 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5955453 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5955454 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5955455 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
5955456 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
5955457 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get
5955458 if you see a fork in the road take it
5955459 you know learning and engagement require thinking in the past people have tried to persuade me to do things differently in order to improve the business but they never asked me to think about the business this is the first time ive ever learned anything here the first time i have really been engaged in solving our problems now that ive had a chance to actually think about our business im beginning to change my ideas about how it works and my role in it
5955460 the great tragedy of the human race is the history of people selling themselves short
5955461 the great tragedy of the engagement movement is the history of leaders selling their people short
5955462 the decision to revisit the existing norms on investment in stock exchanges has been prompted by the fact that the current cap on equity holdings could act as a deterrent to potential promoters of new exchanges
5955463 i dont know what was worse seeing gigantic disgusting centipedes or a gigantic disgusting breast couldnt she use a blanket or something gross
5955464 oh the news said obama plagarized his speech he cant be a good leader
5955465 ready means the facts have been nailed down to our satisfaction the subjects have all been given a full and fair chance to respond and the reporting has been written up with all the proper context and caveats cnn 1
5955466 we have strong disagreements with all the republicans running for president
5955467 with a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation he would offer a choice to a broader range of americans than the rest of the republican field
5955468 desire to push the world in a certain direction to alter other peoples idea of the kind of society they should strive after
5955469 should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5955470 is it possible or desirable to have nothing to do with politics
5955471 no book or by extension any work of art or commentary or reporting could be genuinely free of political intent
5955472 to alter other peoples idea of the kind of society they should strive after
5955473 desire to push the world in a certain direction to alter other peoples idea of the kind of society they should strive after
5955474 two things are important in spreading micro credit in india one is legislation to create micro credit banks small banks who does this lending of micro credit to the poorest people and then a regulatory authority which oversees this operation
5955475 we are trying to go into healthcare because if you are poor it almost implies without question that you are poor in health so it goes together so we are trying to see now that we have brought the micro credit the financial service how to bring the health care to the poor people and its possible
5955476 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5955477 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5955478 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5955479 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us

5955483 revelation that the little girl now 17 years old in clintons
5955484 stories like this are just causing us to see over the important facts of the elections
5955485 i dont know enough about the issue or i cant make a difference so i dont care
5955486 no real background knowledge or actual analysis is required therefore people can easily form opinions talk about it and compare their own lives
5955487 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5955488 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5955489 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5955490 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programmes will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5955491 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5955492 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5955493 i was covering all my preparation costs hardly getting any support from the federation it was the most frustrating moment of my life
5955494 i spent two years preparing for these games but failed to win a medal which is a bit disappointing
5955495 i want to finish up my three year contract deal with adidas before i can think of retiring from the sport
5955496 participated in manhunts persecution and murder of jews in budapest in 1944
5955497 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5955498 i can not coach a team that does not match my ambitions thats why i am leaving atraco
5955499 when you lose mafisango patrick kodo ismail nshutinamagara and many others to follow as coach you must do what you feel is right for you as an individual and for your career
5955500 we dont have any quarrel with him ntagwabira leaving he took the decision as a man and we all accepted it we deemed it the best option for both parties
5955501 we dont have any immediate plans of looking for a new coach in the mean time ruremesha emmanuel will be in charge
5955502 i was nearly knocked down there once so when the police van went the wrong way i sort of said hey mate no entry but he just shouted out of the window f off this is police business
5955503 it was very frightening all i had done was photograph these police officers doing something illegal but i was the one who ended up being arrested
5955504 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5955505 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5955506 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5955507 when this south african swimmers name is mentioned during coverage in beijing expect to hear the phrase true olympic spirit following close behind
5955508 the people who are the spirit of the team are natalie and fellow swimmer mandy loots
5955509 if there are any problems they come from disabled people themselves
5955510 they dont believe that a disabled person should compete in the able bodied olympics and they say the paralympics are just as good my argument is that if you qualify you should be able to compete no matter what
5955511 she never accepted that she was disabled she saw it as a new challenge
5955512 an experiment in giving delight and provocation to its readers
5955513 by an odd coincidence i had just started reading exploding mangoes last week its an amazing book
5955514 the long list this year has some very famous names in it
5955515 but someone recently wrote that there seems to be a hunger for new voices and as a result some consistently brilliant veterans get ignored
5955516 theres been a great vitality in writing from the indian subcontinent for the last 20 years and prizes are not the only measure of it books that have not been on the booker long list or short list have gone on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies at the end of the day a long list or a short list is a subjective measure of a books worth based on the views of three or five people
5955517 its invidious to try and market to ethnic groups although publishers try this all the time the only way that publishers can shape the taste of buyers is to publish the best fiction they can find
5955518 the book buyer has a mind of his or her own that is influenced by word of mouth reviews other readers blogs prizes its very difficult to control peoples taste in books
5955519 in 1981 when rushdie published midnights children he said the only rule is that there are no rules today indian writers are quite adventurous they operate across a very wide spectrum of styles
5955520 it has opened the way for south asian writers to take on the world
5955521 it is one of the few prizes in the world which actually drives sales verifiably
5955522 we published the inheritance of loss in canada the uk and india and everywhere there was a significant difference in the sales of the book before it won the prize and after
5955523 its an old institution financed by old money so probably all it does is help sell some books for some people

5955546 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5955547 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5955548 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5955549 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5955550 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5955551 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5955552 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5955553 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5955554 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5955555 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5955556 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5955557 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5955558 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5955559 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5955560 barack obama brings the attention of the people the way my father did
5955561 being informed on the issues and wanting to do more is just as important as voting
5955562 you dont have to be informed to vote just close your eyes and pick one
5955563 when the company first defaulted in 1998 we wanted to take action but anwar intervened he asked us to
5955564 he said the company would be getting contracts from the government and more businesses so they would be able to pay

5955567 the historic writ petition was filed against naco and its director k sujata rao for their devious role to suppress the allegations against use of sub standard hiv kits during the second national aids control project nacp 2 potentially causing danger of transmission of the deadly aids virus to the unsuspecting patients through contaminated blood transfusion i was a member of the world bank team as a medical consultant that investigated complaints against bogus hiv kits in india during the nacp 2 the world bank published a final report last january showing rampant fraud and corruption with the hiv kits during the nacp 2 instead of taking appropriate corrective measures against the persons responsible for supply of defective hiv kits naco initiated personal attacks against me naco also misrepresented the name of us center for disease control to suppress the evidence of spurious hiv kits this writ petition has sought a full cbi investigation of naco and possible transmission of hiv to ordinary indian citizens as a result of use of sub standard hiv kits during the nacp 2
5955568 the submission concedes one of its brisbane based prosecutors improperly advised afp that haneef could be charged and that advice initially given verbally was later issued in writing by the cdpp following a request from the afp
5955569 cdpp accepts that haneef was charged following advice given by cdpp
5955570 a number of weaknesses in the case and deficiencies in the evidence gathered to date
5955571 the cdpp brisbane case officer has said that he felt an unspoken but extreme pressure to provide positive reassurance to police that they were lawfully entitled to charge haneef in circumstances where he would normally refrain from providing advice
5955572 it seems dpp were provided with incomplete selective and misleading information
5955573 did not have the benefit of a comprehensive statement of facts which is usually provided by police in these circumstances
5955574 has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity
5955575 has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity
5955576 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
5955577 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5955578 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5955579 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
5955580 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5955581 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5955582 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5955583 dies ist erneut ein wichtiger erfolg f r das mam gesch ft von vizrt in deutschland einem f r uns u erst wichtigen markt wie auch der bereits ver ffentlichte zuschlag f r das mam system der deutschen fu ballliga belegt hat hierzulande haben wir mittlerweile f nf system installiert bzw aktuell in der auslieferung
5955584 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5955585 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5955586 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5955587 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5955588 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5955589 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5955590 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5955591 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5955592 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5955593 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5955594 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5955595 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5955596 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5955597 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5955598 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5955599 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5955600 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5955601 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5955602 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5955603 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5955604 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5955605 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5955606 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5955607 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5955608 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5955609 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5955610 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5955611 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5955612 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5955613 as shoppers tighten their belts they are now looking more carefully at premium food prices and questioning why they should pay more for a particular product we know that they will pay more for a better tasting or healthier product but they will not pay more simply for fancy packaging
5955614 extreme food deprivation in african countries alongside excessive grain fed meat consumption in some developed countries will also be highlighted by environmental groups which will further exacerbate the issues
5955615 fundamentally a business revolves around understanding what your customers value and what your customers customers value and what they are willing to pay for then its simply a matter of delivering what your customers value at a sufficiently low cost so that you can make a good profit
5955616 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share

5955621 we are thrilled with the result which is a testament to the strength of the wine market in asia and hong kongs leading role as a regional hub of fine and rare wines
5955622 we already have the world class infrastructure logistics financial and communication systems required and more importantly the discerning palate and ample appetite to become a wine trading and distribution centre in asia
5955623 hong kong is a springboard to the chinese market its a priority for french business to develop in asia
5955624 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
5955625 i highly recommend this team they over deliver on all of their projects
5955626 theres really very little doubt that theyve been successful at that
5955627 commitment to carry on the fight against the criminal hordes until their elimination
5955628 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this
5955629 last season was frustrating and its nice to get a goal it gives me a bit of confidence
5955630 she has spoken to sa police by phone and her next of kin have been notified
5955631 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help the development of human rights
5955632 friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism
5955633 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5955634 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players a fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5955635 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5955636 a knowledgeable and sincere individual from the national cricket fraternity
5955637 it would be great if a former cricketer is appointed as the pcb chairman i believe that somebody who has played cricket at the highest level can run the sport better than anybody else
5955638 the selectors have decided not to send any replacements for injured batsman at the moment as they had selected a 16 member squad for the five match odi series
5955639 we have just completed the test on asifs b sample and it has come back positive
5955640 but i can tell you that the quantity of nandrolone has varied which we can contest
5955641 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
5955642 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
5955643 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
5955644 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
5955645 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
5955646 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
5955647 marching in an olympic games opening ceremony might give individual cricketers goosebumps
5955648 their effort made up for the five catches we dropped and it augurs well for the future of canadian cricket
5955649 i am an opening batsman but i did what my captain asked me to and am pleased that i was able to play a role in my teams win
5955650 i worked very hard to get to this point because my dream was to play for canada when i got here
5955651 it was quite a performance from the young man in his first game
5955652 its a pity that our experienced players in the middle order did not come through
5955653 its a concern that we havent yet had confirmation from all eight countries that they are prepared to go to pakistan
5955654 haroon lorgat is in the uk currently meeting the board of ecb today tuesday he is due in south africa at the end of the week
5955655 the scheduled start time for the tournament is perilously close so of course i am concerned
5955656 its a big decision for the board to make and the players have said whatever they needed to say
5955657 i dont know the answer but i am sure it is capable of being played in another country should that be necessary
5955658 sri lanka is an option there are other options too but i wouldnt wish to to go into that detail at the present time
5955659 after toying with the idea of a consultant and coach for bengal seniors team weve finally agreed on to appoint a consultant amarnath details about amarnaths job profile will be worked out in due course as a consultant he need not stay for the entire season but hell be available depending upon his other commitments
5955660 well do our best to bring back bengal into the elite division initially after taking over we faced a problem in which most of the seniors wanted to leave the state they felt that by representing bengal in plate division chances to make the national or india a side will be less which is a genuine reason
5955661 we had to convince them and then seven players manoj tiwary ranadeb bose laxmi ratan shukla ashok dinda wriddhiman saha and saurashish lahiri pledged to play for bengal and give their best shot to bring back the glory days it was a very touchy gesture from them
5955662 chinmay roy will be the trainer p r shrinivas rao the physio whle prabir mukherjee will be the curator there will be no additional support staff for the coach one coach will be good enough for bengal
5955663 im looking forward to give the boys as much time as possible it will be great if i can help bengal out in any possible way
5955664 i know dalmiya for a long time and he wanted me to look after bengal especially after their poor performance last year
5955665 im very happy to be associated with bengal ill be come to kolkata some time in september and then well discuss how to go about the forthcoming season

5955671 the new capital from wl ross and w p carey comes at an ideal time
5955672 it enables us to fund our growth initiatives support the companys recent contract wins with iveco and porsche and repay existing debt facilities
5955673 we are delighted to support a portfolio company backed by wilbur ross
5955674 furthermore with this transaction closed weve provided approximately eur 100 million in sale leaseback financing in europe in the last two months once again affirming our position as a leading source of alternative long term finance
5955675 we were supportive of the sale leaseback with w p carey as an alternative method of raising capital and enhancing wagons long term value
5955676 i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5955677 truly staggering potential for australia as the world faced up to climate change
5955678 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix he said as he launched the fund in melbourne today
5955679 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
5955680 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5955681 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2 the notes say
5955682 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5955683 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5955684 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5955685 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5955686 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5955687 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5955688 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd
5955689 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5955690 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5955691 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5955692 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5955693 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said
5955694 significant rattled by the shooting but would not give any further details
5955695 try calling vanguard and ask for advice it wont hap
5955696 try calling vanguard and asking for someone to give you advice it wont happen

5955701 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5955702 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5955703 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5955704 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5955705 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5955706 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5955707 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5955708 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5955724 when labor came into power in 2001 western australia was the second lowest taxing state we are now the second highest
5955725 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5955726 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
5955727 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
5955728 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5955729 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5955730 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5955731 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5955732 our information is specific to being in an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5955733 sometimes you win sometimes you lose thats the way it is in sports
5955734 led by two time fifa player of the year ronaldinho brazil came to china as one of the top favorites and players acknowledged that anything short of the title would be a big disappointment the olympics is the only significant trophy the five time world champions have never won
5955735 unfortunately the olympic gold medal in football will have to wait again
5955736 its another generation that couldnt win the title now all we can do is try to win the bronze
5955737 we have to have the strength to stay motivated in a moment like this
5955738 its not easy but we have to keep working hard just as we had been doing before
5955739 we wouldnt have problems if we won all the time but thats not always possible
5955740 the demands will increase but we will continue our work as planned

5955742 but we have to finish the competition with our heads up and that means with the bronze
5955743 belgium is hoping to win its second olympic bronze adding to the medal won at the 1996 atlanta games besides finding ways to motivate his players dunga also has problems with his lineup
5955744 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5955745 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5955746 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5955747 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5955748 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5955749 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5955750 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5955751 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5955752 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5955753 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5955754 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5955755 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5955756 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5955757 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5955758 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5955759 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5955760 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5955761 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5955762 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5955763 we have succeeded in compensating for the reduction in performance fees and contributions of associated companies as far as possible despite the negative market environment we have continued to invest in sales so that our growth is on an even wider basis in the future
5955764 stadnik was far superior but i dont have any regrets about sushil he tried his best but just could not do anything
5955765 stadnik was outstanding in the beginning and i think that was playing on his mind in the last period stadnik was just too good for him
5955766 i knew she was going to come with it i just wanted to get my bat on it
5955767 like i was telling coach you dont even feel it hit the bat you just feel the motions before it but you dont feel it you just see it
5955768 great pitching great defense some great adjustments at the plate
5955769 we know the dodgers have a lot to play for but we feel we do too
5955770 we are swinging the bats really well right now and our bullpen has stepped up
5955771 it got to the point where i couldnt play through the pain and it took me a couple of years to be honest to learn to deal with it
5955772 everybody told me i needed to back off the amount of work i did but when i did that i didnt feel prepared
5955773 buck showalter started giving me days off and it really helped
5955774 thats the hardest part realizing you cant do as much
5955775 i am not going to be 100 percent this season
5955776 i was just ecstatic going on off a walk off at the little league world series
5955777 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5955778 in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5955779 weve got to be realistic its a fundamental challenge to the structure of baa
5955780 ive read enough press and spoken to enough passengers across the country to know that there is a strong demand for change
5955781 to improve the passenger experience we need to get the right capacity in place as soon as possible
5955782 there will be plenty of people lining up to buy those airports feeling they can succeed where baa have failed
5955783 mrs sinclairs body was discovered at her home in the village of amport at around 10pm on saturday august 16 home office pathologist at the royal hampshire county hospital winchester on sunday revealed that mrs sinclair died of stab wounds
5955784 she was the most caring person i have ever known
5955785 even if she was upset or unhappy she would always think of others first and offer sympathy and support
5955786 she didnt want people to worry about her so she would keep her troubles to herself whilst putting on a brave face for the rest of the world
5955787 she was dedicated to her twin boys and sacrificed a lot to keep them happy
5955788 she has achieved so much in her life and was about to embark on a new course when her life was cruelly taken from her we miss her so much
5955789 technology will make it faster and easier but it is a facilitator the key facilitator is networking
5955790 fifty years ago networks were quite limited but now people are highly connected
5955791 technology has made a difference so we are able to network more
5955792 social networking is changing it and bringing it down to three
5955793 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
5955794 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
5955795 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
5955796 nothing more than a code word for the typical income redistribution those on the left have sought since the days of karl marx

5955798 born to jewish parents on new york citys lower east side in 1955

5955800 the habit is a crack in the wall a flaw that calls into question whether the persona axelrod has crafted for obama is who obama really is
5955801 your lessons are too advance we dont have like that before and i dont know what to teach you
5955802 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5955803 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5955804 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5955805 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5955806 i thought you know since youre having a rough time maybe you should rest
5955807 i know i can tell you anything thats why were such good friends
5955808 well get some sleep or whatever chill out miya ill give you a call after dance
5955809 baa has argued that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints
5955810 we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist
5955811 i thought you know since youre having a rough time maybe you should rest
5955812 i know i can tell you anything thats why were such good friends
5955813 well get some sleep or whatever chill out miya ill give you a call after dance
5955814 s lo quedan p ginas as que m s te vale que echen humo

5955817 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5955818 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5955819 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5955820 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5955821 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5955822 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5955823 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5955824 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
5955825 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
5955826 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back so there has been no withdrawal whatsoever
5955827 i just remembered my great aunt always had this and she was in leningrad
5955828 even later when she had plenty of money and food she always had this now we have to think about these things again
5955829 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5955830 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5955831 whether i allow hits or walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5955832 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5955833 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5955834 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5955835 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5955836 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
5955837 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
5955838 sometimes we as hitters as players put a little too much pressure on ourselves
5955839 youve still got to see the ball and hit the ball its not like hes going to make up a pitch with the bases loaded
5955840 we just have to pick up the slack and do the best we can at this point i dont even know what else the organization can do
5955841 its nice to be on the other end of one of those games someone elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt its amazing how that works sometimes
5955842 its the toughest situation a bullpen can be put in and every reliever should crave it i know i do
5955843 i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i paid for it it doesnt matter how many times you get a guy out the one time you dont stinks

5955869 well tommy at school says that rock is dead and im not sure what that means
5955870 is that the same tommy you said who smokes at the school loading dock
5955871 well ill get to tommy in a minute but you ask a pretty interesting question
5955872 well some people say that rock is still going strong but a lot of people say that rock is dead the interesting part is that nobody really agrees on when it died some people say its when elvis died other people say it was before that when the rolling stones played altamont other people say its when young guys like sid vicious or kurt cobain passed on
5955873 well we had to see this film at school called camp rock and tommy was in class and thats what he said afterwards
5955874 im not sure i mean i was watching it and it reminded me of a lot of things like arent you supposed to have drummers and stuff in a rock band
5955875 well a lot of songs were played to keyboards and drum tracks and anyone who played a guitar was only strumming one chord
5955876 yeah that doesnt sound like rock all that much to me
5955877 also the kids worked too hard to be good people i always thought rock stars were a little bit on the bad side the kid whos supposed to be a rock star was a boy but looked and sounded like a girl and the boys and girls all got along even when they werent supposed to they all looked like they came out of the commercials from j crew
5955878 no it wasnt it was pretty boring it was kind of like minus all the touring and stuff
5955879 well it wasnt so bad dad i mean they played the blu ray disc and the 1 78 1 widescreen looked good there wasnt a lot of depth to the background image but the foreground stuff was presentable without being too vivid the pcm soundtrack didnt provide for a lot of sonic engagement it wasnt very immersive and sometimes the dolby digital 5 1 surround track sounded better
5955880 when did you learn so much about audio and video quality son
5955881 mike thomas brings in home theater magazines and we read through them at lunch
5955882 son i hate it when you do that i know youre becoming an adult and all but if these magazines interest you let me know and i can get you a subscription
5955883 youre welcome son did the disc have good bonus features
5955884 they were ok most of it was the usual look at the making of the film but theres a thing on how to be a rock star thats kind of weird its 30 minutes long but they dont really cover anything and some of the stuff they say is weird like to be a rock star youre supposed to listen to what your parents say it sounds like like thats what being a rock star is about
5955885 and not knowing anything about the jonas brothers i think theyre kind of weird looking theyre rock stars who like performing but they spend more time talking about hair and fashion and shopping then they do about music its like theyre girls and this is the band that everyone is freaking out about
5955886 it does kind of tell you something about human nature doesnt it son
5955887 yeah but i did what you said never let the bastards get me down
5955888 is there anything else that you wanted to talk about with the movie son
5955889 yeah dad there was one other thing i found out from jessica and danielle that they also saw the movie and they didnt like it either
5955890 no danielle called it stupid and jessica said it was predictable and dumb now theyre my sisters and just becoming teenagers and theyre supposed to like the jonas brothers if my sisters dont like the movie was does that tell you
5955891 so son does this discussion help clear things up for you

5956139 o my friends there is only kind of love that is fitting for a person like jesus a person who suffered for us like jesus a supreme love love him above your lusts love him above your relations love him above the world love him above all your outward contentments and enjoyments yea love him above your very lives for thus the patriarchs prophets apostles saints primitive christians and the martyrs of old have loved our lord jesus christ with an overtopping love rev xii 11 they loved not their lives unto the death in other words they slighted contemned yea despised their lives exposing them to hazard and loss out of love to the lamb who had washed them in his blood i have read of one dutch schoolmaster who being asked whether he did not love his wife and children answered were all the world a lump of gold and in my hands to dispose of i would leave it at my enemies feet to live with them in a prison but my soul and my saviour are dearer to me than all if my father saith jerome should stand before me and my mother hang upon and my brethren should press about me i would break through my brethren throw down my father and tread underfoot my mother to cleave to jesus christ had i ten heads said henry voes they should all off for christ if every hair of my head said john ardley martyr were a man they should all suffer for the faith of christ let fire racks pulleys said ignatius and all the torments of hell come upon me so i may win christ george carpenter being asked whether he did not love his wife and children which stood weeping before him answered my wife and children my wife and children are dearer to me than all bavaria yet for the love of christ i know them not that blessed virgin in basil being condemned for christianity to the fire and having her estate and life offered her if she would worship idols cried out let money perish and life vanish christ is better than all sufferings for christ are the saints greatest glory they are those things wherein they have most gloried crudelitas vestra gloria nostra your cruelty is our glory saith tertullian it is reported of babylas that when he was to die for christ he desired this favour that his chains might be buried with him as the ensigns of his honour thus you see with what a superlative love with what an overtopping love former saints have loved our lord jesus and can you christians who are cold and low in your love to christ read over these instances and not blush certainly the more christ hath suffered for us the more dear christ should be unto us the more bitter his sufferings have been for us the more sweet his love should be to us and the more eminent should be our love to him oh let a suffering christ lie nearest your hearts let him be your manna your tree of life your morning star it is better to part with all than with this pearl of price christ is that golden pipe through which the golden oil of salvation runs and oh how should this inflame our love to christ oh that our hearts were more affected with the sufferings of christ if a friend should die for us how would our hearts be affected with his kindness and shall the god of glory lay down his life for us and shall we not be affected with his goodness shall saul be affected with davids kindness in sparing his life and shall not we be affected with christs kindness who to save our life lost his own oh the infinite love of christ that he should leave his fathers bosom and come down from heaven that he might carry you up to heaven that he that was a son should take upon him the form of a servant that you of slaves should be made sons of enemies should be made friends of heirs of wrath should be made heirs of god and joint heirs with christ that to save us from everlasting ruin christ should stick at nothing but be willing to be made flesh to lie in a manger to be tempted deserted persecuted and to die upon a cross oh what flames of love should these things kindle in all our hearts to christ love is compared to fire now the property of fire is to turn all it meets with into its own nature fire maketh all things fire the coal maketh burning coals and is it not a wonder then that christ having heaped abundance of the fiery coals of his love upon our heads we should yet be as cold as corpses in our love to him ah what sad metal are we made of that christs fiery love cannot inflame our love to christ moses wondered why the bush consumed not when he sees it all on fire but if you please but to look into your own hearts you shall see a greater wonder for you shall see that though you walk like those three children in the fiery furnace even in the midst of christs fiery love flaming round about you yet there is but little very little true smell of that sweet fire of love to be felt or found upon you or in you oh when shall the sufferings of a dear and tender hearted saviour kindle such a flame of love in all our hearts as shall still be a breaking forth in our lips and lives in our words and ways to the praise and glory of free grace oh that the sufferings of a loving jesus might at last make us all sick with love

5956145 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
5956146 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
5956147 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5956148 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5956149 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5956150 she was so lovely and the fact that she has worn my design makes me so proud

5956155 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas

5956158 father suffered from a bad back so did mother my brothers and sisters and every other individual in a long line of relatives friends and acquaintances since my early years i have always seen the world around me as a great pyramid of leering human heads and at the bottom of this teeming hive society i could see us the marginals the outcasts our bent backs being crushed relentlessly and with great apathy as the rest of the society scrambled up and down like swarms of head insects ganging up tricking devouring and stampeding fellow species in a never ending race to the glory of the pinnacle the structure of this insect pyramid transforms and as it goes top heavy we the sore hunchbacks are pushed deeper into the margins under the weight of a collected past history tradition myth curse hex we sink into a sewer like subterranean of perpetual darkness of a darkness bleak and opaque where your senses are numbed and rendered useless gradually we lose our sight our hearing our sense of taste and touch the eyes go hollow the ears dry up and a thick coat of ignorance replaces our skins only our bent backs will remain at the bottom of the hive society and that too is vestigial with our transformation into a dorsal torso the great pyramid too will undergo a drastic change as more and more individuals turn upwardly mobile with unilateral resolve and strive for positions in the higher echelons the pyramid itself is inverted the structure that once pointed upwards towards the glory now begins because of its very ambition and inherent purpose to point downwards towards the sewer very soon the hive society will not so much be destroyed as it will come apart at the seams the insects will trample and pull each other to the ground chaos and desperation will reign all pretensions and constructs will fall it is in that moment of disorder the need for a guide will be realized at that moment i will stub out my cigarette end my role as the perpetual observer and wooden stick in hand walk back into the midst of society and preach about the mistakes of the past so that they may not be carried into the future only then will they listen only then will this madmans rant get his audience till then i just watch and smoke from out beyond the margins

5956196 well educated management personnel will be a pre requisite for offering the highest international standards of service by the hospitality industry in addition the new indian has a strong entrepreneurial spirit and we have seen several of our indian students embark on numerous successful ventures

5956209 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5956210 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5956211 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5956212 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5956213 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5956214 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5956215 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5956216 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5956217 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5956218 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5956219 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5956220 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5956221 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5956222 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5956223 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5956224 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5956225 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5956226 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5956227 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5956228 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5956229 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5956230 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5956231 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5956232 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5956233 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5956234 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5956235 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5956236 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5956237 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5956238 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5956239 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5956240 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5956241 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5956242 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5956243 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5956244 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5956245 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5956246 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5956247 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5956248 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5956249 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5956250 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5956251 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5956252 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5956253 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5956254 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5956255 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5956256 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5956257 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5956258 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia

5956260 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5956263 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5956264 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra

5956276 the issue is that the current actions taken by russia lead it to isolation as russia rejects any partnership and cooperation
5956277 we cannot permit russia to destroy a sovereign country we support the democracy in georgia and it should be a message to russian president to keep his promises

5956279 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him view larger map
5956280 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5956281 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5956286 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5956287 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5956288 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5956290 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5956291 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5956292 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5956293 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5956294 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5956295 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5956296 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5956297 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5956298 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5956299 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5956300 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5956301 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5956302 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5956303 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5956304 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5956305 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5956306 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5956307 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5956308 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5956309 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5956310 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5956311 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5956312 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5956313 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5956314 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5956315 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5956317 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5956318 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5956319 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5956385 i got to the 320 mark and my right hamstring kind of grabbed on me and i just thought this is unreal this is worse than my worst nightmare

5956387 im very happy about what ive done ive got three golds from three major championships as far as im concerned nothing can spoil that for me
5956388 she had a tough break but she never tested positive so i mean i think that she should have been reinstated
5956389 she works really hard shes very tough she always gets better and better through the rounds and i definitely didnt underestimate her i knew shed be coming thats why i ran the race the way i did
5956390 its something ive given thought to but its a long way away
5956391 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive i feel so betrayed by my body once again
5956392 i can time trial pretty good for a fat kid
5956393 within a sport athletes tend to be more alike than unlike
5956394 you have to remember that every event is made up of different parts
5956395 the tribunal has not been able to deliver judgment on certain cases due to their complexity and notoriety while some individuals are still at large
5956396 the situation is now under control but our biggest problem remains proliferation of arms in the neighboring country of congo it is our only worry and this needs regional political co operation and diplomatic solutions
5956397 the initial machine was manually operated and poor we hope the process will soon begin now that we have a new machine and a technical team in place to handle the exercise
5956398 every gun imported to this region will be branded so that when a criminal is arrested with it we can easily say that this gun is from kenya or uganda
5956399 we chose arusha for all reasons and purposes that the united nations should make the archival institution close to the heart and soul of the people of rwanda as much as possible
5956400 it would make little sense if something that concerns rwanda and is for rwandans and was provided by rwanda is kept outside rwanda the documentation centre should be put in rwanda and arusha retains the electronic and microfilm copies if need be
5956401 if i was a student from canada and i wanted to do research on genocide the first place i would think of is rwanda and not arusha where documents that can help me more in my research on genocide are kept
5956402 the consultative meeting acknowledges and accepts that the united nations un retains ownership of unictr records archives and related equipment after the completion of its activities and that all records archives and related equipment regardless of form remain the property of the un custodian
5956403 taking cognizance of the resources necessary there is need for the un and its african member states the east african community the african union au the international conference on the great lakes region icglr and the private sector to pool resources together
5956404 you are presenting a strong case and its understandable that the un will have to consider it for the sake of africans and rwandans especially who would love to use them in many aspects
5956405 it is difficult to think of anything which would serve the dissident cause better than a shoot to kill policy
5956406 it is also disturbing that we have anyone involved in policing at any level who cant work that out for himself
5956407 it is precisely because we drew a line under that sort of so called policing that we were able to win such wide cross community support for a new beginning in policing
5956408 it is precisely for the same reason that the dissidents are trying so hard to target the police to split them off from the community to drive them back into armoured vehicles heavy armaments and fortified barracks
5956409 unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5956410 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5956411 the long family knows many of those injured personally and the young man who was sadly killed had worked on our farm for the last three summers
5956412 our thoughts are with his family and loved ones and also with those others who have been seriously injured
5956413 since we have children of voting age and we have a pivotal role in decisions made in our homes we saw it as strategic to sensitize fellow women who will pass it on to other home members
5956414 women are good advocates because they have the power to influence their husbands and children more than any one else so this move was strategic for this purpose
5956415 i was called upon by this association to sensitize them on the rules guiding political parties democracy and freedoms as pre requisites for free and fair elections
5956416 after balancing estimates of supply and demand and collecting data from many sources including that from the informal sector survey it is possible that rwanda is doing extremely well
5956417 in spite of the fact that things have changed and this is 2008 the growth rate will be calculated using 2006 prices which will call for some revision in relation to the level and growth rate of the gdp since 2001
5956418 in order to co ordinate and promote the development of national statistics there is need for carrying out major censuses and surveys and estimating the gdp for good policy making
5956419 he told us that he was going for another job
5956420 we are happy with the cooperation between our two countries and we appreciate and hope this is all going to build on the already good relationship
5956421 china will try its best to define new areas of cooperation in the years to come i hope all these efforts will help boost economic development in rwanda and even further improve china rwanda relations
5956422 we shall achieve this by strictly observing the guidelines in the two memoranda of understanding mou recently entered between it the national electoral commission nec and donors
5956423 we will not interfere in any process but will communicate the elements which could be improved as well as those elements which work especially well
5956424 we stand for the people we will continue to sensitize rwandans to continue voting leaders who will help them
5956425 we have an obligation to help both the government and the people we represent

5956436 all in all given the activism of rwandan womens groups and the high level of womens representation in the chamber of deputies rwanda provides an excellent case for examining the effect of womens parliamentary representation
5956437 the strong advocacy of international feminism by many of the deputies their insistence that the rwandan situation of gender equity should be campaigned for and replicated in other parliaments seems new
5956438 all fire arms belonging to a given state must be marked with the country code and the serial number such that if at all that particular weapon is found in another country we can trace it
5956439 not only do these weapons prolong violent conflict but their uncontrolled propagation equally poses a serious threat to stability or long term development at national and regional levels

5956452 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive

5956533 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5956534 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5956535 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5956536 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5956537 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5956538 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5956539 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5956540 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5956541 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5956542 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5956543 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5956544 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5956545 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5956546 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5956547 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5956548 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5956549 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5956550 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5956551 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5956552 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5956553 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5956554 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5956555 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5956556 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5956557 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5956558 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5956559 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5956560 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5956561 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5956562 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5956563 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5956564 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5956565 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5956566 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5956567 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5956568 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5956569 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5956570 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5956571 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5956572 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5956573 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5956574 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5956575 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5956576 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5956577 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5956578 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5956579 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5956580 gabby i really enjoy the time weve spent together but it is obvious to me that we are in different places in our lives and we want different things out of a relationship and i respect myself too much to let you continue to treat me this way
5956581 birthright citizens melinda rosas henry cejudo you did a great job

5956584 your computer and any other plugged in electronic devices can still get smoked by a lightning strike but if you have a good surge protector or better yet ups and if the lightning isnt on top of you there isnt necessarily a huge risk
5956585 we had to destroy the system in order to save it
5956586 im interested but have no idea when if it might get to my home
5956587 and cannot find any of the qualifing products listed on the microsoft office professional for windows 95 box
5956588 weve not announced plans at this point for dc comcast would love to know our advance plans for the district and were not inclined to help them any sooner than we have to
5956589 nuke the site from orbit its the only way to be sure
5956590 maybe hp is trying to tell you to get your next printer or scanner from other vendor
5956591 unable to determine the exact cause of this error however this problem was most likely caused by an error in your omputers ram during the crash analysis we noticed the bios system version on this computer does not match the specifications for the cpu that is installed on your computer this can occur when a newer processor is installed on an older system board or older bios
5956592 since my pets are in there i dont want wires that can be chewed
5956593 were just running in tandem with the other markets the sentiment here is the same as with the others considering the uptick in oil prices and further disappointments in the economy of the united states
5956594 the economy of the united states is still on the downside and that is affecting all the markets including ours
5956595 august is usually a bear time a consolidation time so its not really a surprise
5956596 i think they bsp are selling dollars at the 45 65 level but im not sure if its a big amount
5956597 ati has a number of contracts where it totally manages the printer infrastructure fleet including procurement ownership management break fix and help desk services
5956598 csg has been investing in technology people and resources to enter this space for some time and ati fits perfectly into our strategy
5956599 this was particularly important given the recent trend in selective sourcing and the push for australian based companies
5956600 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5956601 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5956602 we all got registered all ok jno orville and all are now on our way nice and cool and doing nicely billy is here and says to tell oma much love your edmund

5956604 to relieve you from any extraordinary anxiety i am happy to inform you that the symptoms which attend the presidents indisposition are not threatening
5956605 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5956606 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5956607 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5956608 this is a planning took where all things are going
5956609 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5956610 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5956611 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5956612 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5956613 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5956614 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5956615 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5956616 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5956617 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5956618 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5956619 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5956620 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5956621 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5956622 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5956623 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5956624 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5956625 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5956626 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5956627 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5956628 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5956629 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5956630 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5956631 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5956632 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5956633 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5956634 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5956635 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5956636 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5956637 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5956638 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5956639 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5956640 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5956641 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5956642 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5956643 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5956644 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5956645 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5956646 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5956647 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5956648 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5956649 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5956650 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5956651 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5956652 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5956653 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5956654 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5956655 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
5956656 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a guinness world record holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
5956657 the only web sites that are platform exclusive these days either provide a specalized service of no use to people running other software think microsofts windows update or are run by idiots who think its a good idea to turn away willing customers for no reason
5956658 we have found and blocked zango search assistant 10 0 341 0 to view details select view blocked items
5956659 socket error 10060 port 25 protocol smtp a connection attempt failed because the connected party did not respond after a period of time or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond
5956660 where itunes has a 1 to 5 stars rating scheme the zune app only lets you designate a song as something you like or hate using heart and broken heart icons
5956661 your system has a virus download our virus software now
5956662 like its finally me thats in charge of this relationship
5956663 no thank you i do not want a new contract right now
5956664 this file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action create an association in the set associations control panel
5956665 we do it if people call us about their speed
5956666 what you should do next btw is tell comcast that fios is coming that youre going to kick them to the curb if they cant beat fios promotional rate from what i hear you should have excellent odds of getting a break on your bill
5956667 no im trying out office 2008 and the worst side effect ive seen is that if you dont uncheck one option in the install assistant youll get some extra fonts you might not want
5956668 why do you need hd to look at wolf blitzers beard
5956669 if your time machine backup is interrupted because you took your portable on the road or put your mac to sleep time machine will simply stop backing up when you reconnect to your backup drive again time machine automatically picks up where it left off
5956670 you do however need an external hard drive the one inside your mac wont do
5956671 pc in mini d sub 15pin x 1 female analog rgb components audio in m3 jack x 1 serial d sub 9 pin x 1 male external control rs 232c compatible
5956672 ill start you when i want you now bug off leave me alone and i dont want to have this talk with you again
5956673 notice how well all those non ipod music players are doing
5956674 an unexpected error occurred 0 your firmware cannot be updated see www apple com support for more information
5956675 not really but thats mainly because i havent done a thorough comparison of them in too long from what i hear from readers most of them make networking way too difficult
5956676 this 25 program fixed all the problems i had with my router
5956677 i suspect d link wont be flattered by this endorsement since rockville basically said
5956678 well this company was within its rights to do what it just did to me
5956679 are there any dsl modems that include wifi not sure that i can think of any
5956680 place two fingers on trackpad and click button for secondary click
5956681 thats the problem your computer is too old this wifi is brand new and is just delivering too much too fast for it
5956682 you dont need a mac unless youre 14 years old
5956683 not to say im not anxious in light of what just occurred
5956684 but its a reality and all i can do is cross my fingers and pray and continue being very proud of him
5956685 i have every ounce of faith that he is smart enough and has enough leadership qualities that hes going to come out safe and alive and in one piece
5956686 its hard it makes me more angry than anything else
5956687 i might not be a gunner but i would have been in the humvee with them
5956688 a mothers first instinct is just to get to their child and i couldnt do anything
5956689 with my sons it just makes them all the more positive about defending the country thats where they want to be its what they want to do
5956690 for me im a mother i just have to support their decision and pray a lot
5956691 its the same old same old youre losing takeoff at the big heights what are you gonna do you gotta learn to keep takeoff you got caught at that meat grinder i did not and i told 10 people i did not want to be caught in that meat grinder between 65 and 80 you had to though you werent on you know your warmups didnt go well you went 55 you got caught up in that meat grinder what are you gonna do shrugs what are you gonna do looks off to the side you didnt have the legs her legs are fresh hey its a silver medal though not bad for someone whos been pole vaulting for four years
5956692 absolutely tim that routine was spectacular one slight flaw but minuscule compared to what he did
5956693 nastia just wants to know what the heck is going on
5956694 at times like this you just have to remind yourself ive won four olympics gold medals here and i won the most cherished gold medal there is in this sport
5956695 but boy would things be different here if that hadnt happened
5956696 i just feel the year is going to fly by
5956697 im worried because its going to be a little crazy and i dont know how to go about applying
5956698 its weird being the oldest its like everyone else here are babies now
5956699 all the stuff we get to learn and do were not at school very much
5956700 im just worried im going to pick a school that i wont necessarily get along with the team or fit in well
5956701 this first day of school is our last first day of school
5956702 in the second lebanon war we had much greater means and capabilities which we avoided using since during that war we fought against a terror organization and not a country
5956703 in this context if lebanon turns into a hizbullah state we wont restrain our response
5956704 the right of lebanon its people its army and the resistance hizbullah to liberate its land
5956705 a more vital role than it ever has in the past
5956706 there will no longer be a situation in which the war is waged in distant battlefields while in big cities life continues as normal the war will also reach cities and the homes of israeli citizens and the aim of our enemies will be to hit the home front
5956707 more than ever before you in the home front command will have a critical role in the battlefield of the future because you are charged with caring for the civilian population
5956708 one of the things that is important to me is to reduce the amount of anxiety the public feels
5956709 we do not have to scare ourselves more than necessary with respect to the threats
5956710 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5956711 for you who wanna take your time if you wear them with your boyfriend girlfriend you guys will look really nice in those t shirts
5956712 the original illustration of yukkuri shite ittene is really bothering well as you can see their face expressions and what they say do not match at all i dont know if its getting popular or not but for sure it has some kind of power to let people be poisoned so you cant get out of its world once you get in the world
5956713 please take your time but if you take too long the t shirt may be gone slowly but hurry please take your time to buy

5956725 and again it could be a possibility that they both kick one could be long field goals the other could be short but the numbers will help us with that
5956726 without being scared that someone is going to jump through the window and strangle you
5956727 never ive had enough of school and not at sixty eight forget it

5956760 just do it how one couple turned off the tv and turned on their sex lives for 101 days no excuses

5956777 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy

5956979 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
5956980 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
5956981 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
5956982 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that
5956983 to bounce back like i did after that huge disappointment maybe showed the manager what kind of character i am maybe that persuaded him

5957050 several of us have been playing with each other for a very long time
5957051 shes got such good ball skills and is very speedy
5957052 but we cant concentrate solely on her their whole team is fantastic were excited about it
5957053 abby was not only one of our best players but she was also a leader and you cant replace that
5957054 but so many people are picking up some of the pieces for us our scoring has become more unpredictable
5957055 a lot of people could have been hurt from this like my parents and my teammates
5957056 it made me think of how lucky i am that nothing bad happened that night to me or to anyone else drinking and driving do not mix
5957057 one of the things i have learned from this is that if we are going to party
5957058 we need to have someone with us that can help make good choices someone who can say dont do that
5957059 i think first year defensive line coach glenn spencer has done an excellent job with those guys

5957067 i cant help noticing that andrew has decided to elevate this campaigns tone with eleven posts and counting as i write about the possibility that john mccain fabricated and or plagiarized his story about a north vietnamese guard sketching a christmas time cross in the prison camp dirt
5957068 look if andrew thinks the possible cross in the dirt fabrication represents a fruitful line of anti mccain inquiry he has every right to pursue it
5957069 but given my colleagues steady appeals for a more high minded approach to political argument i think he should ponder whether this sort of thing might just possibly be part of the problem rather than part of the solution

5957107 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5957108 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5957109 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5957110 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5957111 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5957112 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5957113 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5957114 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5957115 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5957116 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5957117 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5957118 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5957119 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5957120 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5957121 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5957122 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5957123 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5957124 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5957125 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5957126 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5957127 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5957128 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5957129 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5957130 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5957131 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5957132 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5957133 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5957134 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5957135 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5957136 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5957137 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5957138 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5957139 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5957140 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5957141 today we are raising a question of russias membership in nato
5957142 we believe we can talk about more profound integration with nato but only if russia is regarded as an equal partner

5957151 i always get anonymous calls from men asking for lube
5957152 they tell me not to ask any questions and just put the lube inside a magazine and leave it in the caf s or streets
5957153 many young and recently diagnosed hiv positive men have therapeutic optimism thinking that with the availability of certain treatments in the past nine years or so the disease is curable and they are not infectious
5957154 because the hepatitis c virus attacks the liver and hiv aids patients receive highly toxic antiretroviral drugs that take a toll on the liver it makes treatment much more complicated
5957155 were making a proposal to the government to prescribe men with viagra in order to increase their chance of using condoms
5957156 it feels like a cheat an evasion a con game for stunted children

5957159 and so the middle ages have remained if not profession my hobby and a constant temptation i see the period everywhere transparently overlaying my daily concerns which do not look medieval though they are

5957163 if you cant have the reality a dream is just as good
5957164 why should a man be scorned if finding himself in prison he tries to get out and go home or if when he cannot do so he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison walls the world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it in using escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word and what is more they are confusing not always by sincere error the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the deserter

5957187 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5957188 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5957189 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said
5957190 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information dr elliot said

5957207 with such an array of financial products to choose from it can be tempting to turn to a price comparison site to do the legwork for you
5957208 but you might be very confused to find different sites can give you vastly different quotes and often dont give enough information for you to make an informed choice
5957209 you need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote and remember that cheapest isnt always best its a false economy if you dont get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim
5957210 moneysupermarket com is the only price comparison website with a clear commitment to customers on how it will behave our customer promise makes it clear our aim is to compare more providers than any other site to list every provider and make clear which ones we dont list and why that the price you see is the price you pay and that you wont get cheaper by going direct
5957211 there are various reasons why which may have found quotes differed from site to site for example some comparison sites dont compare as many insurers or products as we do therefore the search results would be different its also worth pointing out that this research is nearly two months out of date and since then weve added even more insurers and products to our service and will be adding still more in the very near future
5957212 we do have trouble nowadays with the young vets who tend to see everything in black and white

5957217 they are going to say he is young and hes got a funny name and hes not patriotic enough weve seen this campaign before they have been running this movie for a long time it works for republicans because it feeds into the real cynicism that people have about government
5957218 the whole thing boils down to who is ready to lead
5957219 senator obama would have the federal government increase all sorts of taxes
5957220 whether its arriving late to the fight in afghanistan or supporting higher taxes during a struggling economy barack obama has shown that he doesnt have the judgment to lead
5957221 people are finally realizing what he stands for and how much he cares for the middle class
5957222 its clear that this is a wake up call not just to governments but to the community he said in sydney
5957223 we need to look at new ways new technologies and new methods to drive down these tragic figures
5957224 an independent voice kay hagan former vice president at north carolinas largest bank then a decade in the state senate reaching across party lines to ban drivers licenses for illegal immigrants balance five state budgets in a row expand early childhood education and raise teacher pay now the u s senate needs a leader wholl finally put independent thinking and middle class families before the washington special interests
5957225 i think we need the revenue and i think we need the alternative of taking pressure off the property tax
5957226 but im not sure we have time to do it right and im not sure it would pass even if it did
5957227 it is a serious event and were taking it seriously
5957228 we are very concerned that an incident like this would have occurred our deepest concern is about patient care
5957229 disciplinary actions have been taken to emphasize that attentive quality patient care is the essential responsibility for every employee
5957230 so far our borrowers are doing pretty well but im anxious for them a little bit
5957231 im depressed for those communities we have helped to build up
5957232 we have one focus and that is to get the neighborhood stabilized
5957233 find vacant properties and put into them families with weak credit and let them rent for three to five years
5957234 but it may help pilot something that can be applied on a bigger scale

5957242 im certainly happy to be called liddy because this just shows that theyre good friends people ive known for a long time
5957243 the last thing on earth we need is to have tobacco added to that list
5957244 they dont have expertise in tobacco and heaven knows they dont have the funding to do what theyre doing now
5957245 i dont think fda has the staff to do tobacco regulation at this point in time
5957246 this is a back door way of simply shutting down the industry entirely
5957247 were going to be having a voter identification and turnout program
5957248 it is true that it has gone republican in presidential elections but its not so republican that you dont have to work here and bring the candidate and do your voter turnout and advertise and all that
5957249 im confident that third party review will become part of the food safety system in this country
5957250 we need to build new economies aeronautics the military and a green economy
5957251 we believe this is the best option available to ensure setanta is able to fully recover from this injury
5957252 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5957253 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5957254 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5957255 he seemed fairly relaxed but tried to keep himself to himself some passengers started hassling him and asking questions but he got moved away from them all
5957256 at first he asked to be allowed to enter to thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted
5957257 this situation is still far from clear he has been told that he will be arrested if he attempts to enter thailand
5957258 they see eze as a place where they can get away from it all and play music as loud as they like
5957259 bono had the tracks playing on his stereo and people heard them outside but nobody expected them to be recorded
5957260 their snouts have been at our trough feeding free for too long
5957261 this is the first time that a major brand has introduced a low abv offering to the cider market in the uk and we are convinced that this will unlock a whole new range of occasions where magners can be enjoyed
5957262 this is at a substantial price to its off trade selling price for magners original which is typically at the equivalent of 1 33 a pint it would obviously be a boost to profits should it prove successful
5957263 thats great news id been looking out for their results
5957264 a couple of times in the past athletes have come and asked for advice kenny being one of them
5957265 basically we talked about how to peak how to produce your best performance at the big event
5957266 obviously as a very talented competitor himself kenny knew what to do but probably felt he was slightly underachieving at the big event we had a good day together i went through a few things gave him a bit of advice and a few sports psychology books
5957267 yet i wont take any credit for what hes achieved the things hes been saying are nice but boxers put in an incredible amount of work and its wonderful to see it paying off
5957268 one of the keys i put across to him at the time is his ability to do his own thing to be self sufficient and concentrate on his own performance and not be distracted
5957269 there should be only one thought in his head at this stage his semi final bout and not getting drawn up into how hes done so far
5957270 im 36 years old and ive spent probably 20 years gaining the experience i have
5957271 some olympic athletes gymnasts for example are asked to be worldly experienced at age 16 which is an incredibly difficult thing to do
5957272 the only way to tap into experience without actually going through it yourself is to learn from books and listen to other people
5957273 ive been motivated since age 18 to seek help outside of the mainstream i believe the better people in all sports seek out help wherever they can find it and its great that kenny wasnt afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me
5957274 though i must mention that i had a talk with the dublin football team a few years ago and the following day they went out and lost to carlow
5957275 so i cant say ive a 100pc record in these things but its great to see kenny doing well and its exciting for me to have someone to follow at the olympics we all wish him the very best going forward
5957276 he was very shocked and doesnt want to talk about it in view of the ongoing police and garda investigations
5957277 we were searching for anything which may have been tossed from the hijacked car before the vehicle crossed the border
5957278 its important that we do play the game as we have everything set out
5957279 everyone knew it was going to go ahead somewhere but i think people will look forward to it more
5957280 no matter where the game is played its important for the group that it went ahead
5957281 when he qualified he said to me that the one fight he wanted was shiming in front of his home crowd and now its going to happen i am just so proud how could i not be
5957282 i am sure everybody back home is very happy its the first medal that ireland has won the first irish boxing medal in 16 years and the first medal a northern irish person has won in 16 years
5957283 i always knew he would make it to the olympics and i always knew he was something special
5957284 i think he has a great chance it is going to be hard fighting the world champion in his own backyard but its what paddy wanted i know that if shiming did beat him he would have to earn it
5957285 i was very confident when he went out that he would do well
5957286 even though the polish guy had beaten him before it did not surprise me when he won paddy has been working on his tactics so when he won 11 5 it shows you that he has been going ok but paddy is out there for the gold and i am confident he can do it
5957287 i am absolutely proud of him hes the fifth individual kid from the holy family club to win an olympic medal its the icing on the cake
5957288 no podemos aceptar que solamente se mencionen en la resoluci n dos de los seis puntos del plan de paz ni que se incluyan condicionantes pol ticos

5957308 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5957309 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5957310 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5957311 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5957312 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5957313 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia

5957317 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5957318 credit market turmoil has driven the u s into a recession and may topple some of the nations biggest banks said kenneth rogoff former chief economist at the international monetary fund
5957319 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
5957320 the u s housing slump has triggered about 500 billion in credit market losses for banks globally and led to the collapse and sale of bear stearns cos the fifth largest u s securities firm bonds of regional banks such as national city corp and keycorp are under pressure on expectations of more fallout rogoff 55 said the government should nationalize fannie mae and freddie mac the nations biggest mortgage finance firms
5957321 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds
5957322 banks repossessed almost three times as many u s homes in july as a year earlier and the number of properties at risk of foreclosure jumped 55 percent according to realtytrac inc an irvine california based seller of foreclosure data u s builders broke ground on the fewest houses in 17 years last month according to a bloomberg news survey
5957323 rogoff told a conference in singapore today that the credit crisis is likely to worsen and a large bank may fail reuters reported earlier he was the imfs chief economist from august 2001 to september 2003
5957324 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
5957325 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
5957326 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
5957327 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
5957328 it shouldnt come as a shock when mountainous option arm and alt a loans begin resetting and the second leg of the credit crisis begins alt a loans were given to borrowers with credit scores of between 620 and 700 and included the option of interest only loans option arms and no documentation loans that required little if any documentation for loan approval ninety percent of those that got an option arm in 2006 provided little or no documentation ninety percent and its estimated that only 60 of option arm borrowers make only minimum monthly payments others estimate that up to 80 say a borrower makes minimum payments on a 600 000 loan that loan could easily be a 750 000 loan within two years and were supposed to be shocked when this problem ends in the second credit crisis
5957329 ich habe zwar unterschrieben aber der hat zu viel abgebucht
5957330 to stop the third world invasion of the west we westerners must first and foremost remove from power and prosecute those who have betrayed us that done we can address our external threats otherwise the west will decompose either path will be bloody
5957331 jews are not the only enemy and not all jews are enemies im not going to sugar coat what i have to say any more than that im not being coy ive just realized and said flat out jews are my enemy
5957332 they are probably less numerous and outspoken than they used to be
5957333 ive just realized and said flat out jews are my enemy
5957334 that im a phony defender of the west because i really just care about asserting traditionalist christianity and putting down secular liberalism

5957343 is not the way to deal in the 21st century
5957344 especially if this ruling is appealed us v boucher could become a landmark case
5957345 the idea of trade is that everyone does what he is best and most efficient at and exchanges the products of that labor for stuff others do better and cheaper to aim for self sufficiency is to aim for bankruptcy

5957349 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5957350 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5957351 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5957352 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5957353 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5957354 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5957355 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5957356 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5957357 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5957358 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5957370 sellers are realizing that theres a lot of inventory out there
5957371 and if they want to sell their house they have to price it extremely competitively
5957372 a decent amount of the selling population has their houses unrealistically listed
5957373 sellers see that they have competition now they didnt have competition before
5957374 people were coming in looking and saying yeah this is a nice house but i can do better down the road
5957375 get on with it already it was like a freakin month ago now

5957385 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again

5957388 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5957389 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5957390 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5957391 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5957392 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them

5957402 i want to give 10 percent of my income to my church when my income was 50 week i gave 5 to the church every sunday when i was successful in business and my weekly income rose to 500 a week i gave 50 to my church every sunday but now my income has gone to 5 000 a week and i just cant bring myself to give 500 to the church every week
5957403 dear god please make this mans weekly income 500 so that he can tithe

5957406 although neck collars are widely used there are alternative methods such as microchip telemetric devices that are implanted subcutaneously the collar can hook on branches etc posing a risk to the animal
5957407 the collar may prevent the animals from performing natural behaviour such as grooming the area around the neck and chin
5957408 we are of the opinion that the collar shown in the visuals is totally inappropriate and unacceptable
5957409 we can take them to three troops each of which has a collared animal and if any of those collared animals is showing any signs of tugging at the collar or worrying about it we will take it off immediately
5957410 but since deploying the collars weve seen every animal and not once have we seen any sign of distress caused by the collar and the suggestion that they cant groom is nonsense
5957411 but we have to weigh that up against the possible merits which to me far outweigh any inconvenience thats what the ethics committees are there for to assess the potential scientific merit of the work against that inconvenience
5957412 and the scientific merit of this work is worth the method and the method will provide an important conservation improvement to the status of these baboons

5957414 in just over a week you will be casting your vote at the convention
5957415 on june 7 senator clinton only suspended not ended her campaign we have now been assured that senator clintons name will be placed in nomination as you know neither senator clinton nor senator obama has actually clinched the nomination since neither of them has won enough pledged delegates to reach a majority that is why it has fallen upon you and your fellow superdelegates to make the most important choice you can make at this urgent time for our nation there is still time to choose the most electable candidate senator hillary clinton
5957416 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5957417 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
5957418 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
5957419 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
5957420 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
5957421 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
5957422 ashamed of the strong arming political threats and thinly veiled suggestions that have been sent to democratic delegates and superdelegates during this primary season these thug tactics appear to be increasing as senator obama begins the downward slide in the polls and senator clintons support grows
5957423 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright ayers rezko soros pfleger farakkhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
5957424 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned

5957508 the democratic senatorial campaign committee is responsible for the content of this advertising
5957509 the conventional wisdom is that this election is going to be a referendum on barack obama
5957510 his people are smart enough to realize this doesnt necessarily work to their benefit
5957511 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
5957512 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
5957513 its revealing that barack obamas attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
5957514 what senator obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice

5957528 the whole thing boils down to who is ready to lead
5957529 senator obama would have the federal government increase all sorts of taxes
5957530 whether its arriving late to the fight in afghanistan or supporting higher taxes during a struggling economy barack obama has shown that he doesnt have the judgment to lead

5957557 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change
5957558 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
5957559 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
5957560 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
5957561 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
5957562 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere you could also have drier air these are far more critical factors than the ocean being warmer
5957563 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
5957564 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
5957565 we cant even reliably forecast el nino when you look 50 years into the future youre getting a picture but could you be totally wrong yes
5957566 i am skeptical of those who would state those results as something like an undeniable fact for the future
5957567 it is a possible guide for the future but certainly the models are not pointing to increased activity
5957568 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
5957569 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
5957570 there is now a near consensus that global air temperatures are increasing however there is no consensus on how this has affected the temperature of the worlds oceans and in particular in the atlantic ocean or how much of the recent warming trend is attributable to mans activities
5957571 recent scientific research indicates that in a future warming world the atlantic may experience two primary effects related to hurricane development
5957572 first a warmer environment may continue to elevate sea surface temperatures ssts thereby providing more fuel for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify
5957573 so while it is true that warmer ssts may lead to more frequent hurricane activity elevated wind shear may counteract or possibly even overturn this effect
5957574 which of these factors critical to the development of tropical cyclones will ultimately win out is the subject of lively debate within the scientific community and beyond
5957575 for example simulations of tropical cyclone activity carried out at the gfdl using climate conditions projected for the 21st century indicate the potential for decreased hurricane activity under more pronounced global warming conditions and cautions against a reliance on statistical extrapolations of recently elevated activity levels through the end of the century
5957576 it is not clear what effect global warming is having and will have on the frequency intensity and geographical distribution of hurricanes in the atlantic basin
5957577 however models are less clear about hurricane activity in individual ocean basins
5957578 for instance in the atlantic some models suggest a long term increase in frequency with others suggesting a decrease
5957579 the evidence shows that there has been an increase in the average intensity of hurricanes in the atlantic since the 1970s and an increase in frequency since 1995 but it is not clear what contribution if any global warming has made to these changes
5957580 professor gray is absolutely correct that hurricane formation and development depend on factors such as sea surface temperature
5957581 however it would be wrong to suggest that these factors could only be affected by natural changes in climate and not by man made global warming
5957582 both natural climate variability and man made global warming influence hurricane formation and development
5957583 the real question is to what extent they contribute over the time scale of interest this is still an open scientific question
5957584 for the layman there is sometimes a tendency to regard every new discovery or scientific finding from the latest published paper as an inviolate fact
5957585 in reality rarely is there ever a last and final word in studies of complex systems such as earths environment rather science is a dynamic process based on the scientific method in which researchers test hypotheses leading to new discoveries but also reexamine earlier theories and try to improve build upon or extend them
5957586 there are those who want to attribute any perceived increase in natural disasters to anthropomorphic global warming i predict that if we have an active hurricane season someone will attribute it to agw theyre not really looking at the science theyre looking at the disaster
5957587 i keep in regular touch with colleagues abroad who are experts in combating terrorism if i tell them who we have sitting in our lower house they look at me as if ive come from another planet

5957589 in the 1980s i was involved as many greenlefters were in the squatters movement squatting is also breaking in but does that mean that everything outside the law is also unacceptable i dont think so

5957591 un experto de la universidad nacional autonoma de mexico pronostico que en alrededor de diez anos la tierra entrara a una pequena era de hielo que durara de 60 a 80 anos y sera causada por la disminucion de la actividad solar
5957592 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
5957593 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots
5957594 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5957595 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5957596 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5957597 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5957598 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5957599 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5957600 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5957601 i think there is a fair chance perth will be the 21st centurys first ghost metropolis
5957602 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
5957603 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
5957604 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
5957605 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

5957607 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

5957610 the information and communication technology sector has much to offer in creating a cleaner greener world but it must also apply international standards in reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions
5957611 very appreciative of the drive that has come from the itu telecommunication standardisation sector on this topic paving the way for the establishment of the focus group
5957612 climate change is one of the major issues of our time and the key role that itu is playing in addressing the issue has been acknowledged by the un secretary general icts are a contributor to global warming but more importantly they are the key to monitoring and mitigating its effects
5957613 we have heard from industry and from the un secretary general that itu must tackle this issue of global importance i encourage all interested parties to participate this group is open to all and i encourage contributions from the ict sector as well as other industry sectors research institutes and any other specialists in this field
5957614 we must remind ourselves that this is only a first step on the long road to finding and implementing global solutions to the challenge of climate change through the use of icts what is important now is how we act and follow up on the momentum we have created

5957619 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5957620 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5957621 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5957622 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5957623 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5957624 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5957625 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5957626 today in this room theres been yet another attempt to turn things on their head and portray the aggressors as the victim
5957627 theres a clear expression of propaganda in detriment to serious important political work which needs to be done in the security council

5957630 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5957631 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5957632 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5957633 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5957634 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5957635 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5957636 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5957637 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5957638 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5957639 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5957640 given the year its been and how much effort hes put in to try to get himself right i dont think its really a surprise
5957641 i think weve kind of been conditioning ourselves to be prepared to go on should he not be able to pitch
5957642 the likelihood of this being season ending is probably very real
5957643 what hes got to do is not make any kind of decision where emotions are involved with an arm problem
5957644 he showed this spring that his body is still strong
5957645 well wait a while and see what he wants to do
5957646 my heart goes out to him ive had times like that myself
5957647 i just hope hell be all right and i hope hell still be around
5957648 hes a fighter hes a tough guy and its a tough loss

5957664 this is a special game wales v georgia for the country no one from russia believed it was possible to bring 18 players out with us from a war torn country the president asked me to come out with these players he told me that the result wasnt important this game is simply to show russia that you can bomb us and you can send tanks into our country but you will never stop our people this is a symbol that they will not defeat us the 11th of august was the worst night because everyone thought the russians were going to arrive in tbilisi and kill everyone i think under this situation you can understand that football was not important
5957665 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
5957666 i was amused to read davids comments he is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english club outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league in the meantime birmingham have managed a couple of relegations and a lengthy spell in the championship somehow i dont believe even their own supporters would agree their highs and lows have been preferable to ours
5957667 750 000 with wenger intending to use the frenchman as a
5957668 that ferdinand has always appeared the likelier starter than terry under capello
5957669 the fa hierarchy worry more about terry as a role model and had hoped ferdinand would have been appointed to unite the dressing room
5957670 capello has drawn the conclusion that there is a dearth of emerging talent
5957671 scolari appears to have taken all of about eight seconds to make up his mind that he would be keeping terry as chelsea captain capello has taken eight months to come to the same conclusion for england
5957672 terrys appointment is bothersome because it means he will play every game
5957673 has kept the same captain that steve mcclaren installed two years ago he somehow contrived to make the appointment seem like his own
5957674 is a fullback primarily an attacker or a defender its not an easy question and theres no right or wrong answer
5957675 the move is expected to cost arsenal in the region of 750 000 and will represent one of the biggest transfer shocks of the summer given uniteds usual reluctance to do business with any of their major rivals and the fact ferguson has never allowed a player of his to defect to wengers side brian kidd was the last united player to go in the same direction in 1974 and silvestre would have been entitled to a testimonial had he stayed at old trafford one more season another surprise for arsenals fans is that wenger does not regard the former internazionale defender merely as a squad player or as a back up for ga l clichy at left back but as a first choice centre half alongside william gallas primarily as a replacement for philippe senderos
5957676 what makes the deal so remarkable is that wenger and his bitter rival united manager sir alex ferguson have never before traded players in the 12 years they have been in opposition in the premier league the two men have often been in competition for the same player from overseas and have at times coveted members of each others squads wenger for example considered a move for david beckham when he left united in 2003 and ferguson always wanted former gunners captain patrick vieira but no deal between the two men has ever been close to coming off
5957677 capello seems determined to shake the biggest names in english football out of the unhealthy assumption that there will always be a place for them in the starting line up in the case of michael owen he seems determined to go further and with beckham steven gerrard and frank lampard seemingly competing for two places in the xi against the czech republic tonight it is a message that is becoming unequivocal
5957678 the irony is that ferdinand has always appeared the likelier starter than terry under capello an admirer of the talents of jonathan woodgate and ledley king though the new manager now appears to have settled upon his first choice centre half pairing it is unclear whether the italian actually places as much significance on the identity of his captain as either the football association or the majority of the england fan base yet what is perceived to be the first major decision of his stewardship has seen capello emulate his predecessor and could also be considered a risk mcclaren handed terry 13 games as captain before his reign disintegrated with the failure to reach euro 2008
5957679 although ferdinand is hardly a choirboy members of the fa hierarchy worry more about terry as a role model and had hoped ferdinand would have been appointed to unite the dressing room if the czech republics milan baros leads terry a merry dance at wembley this evening then capello will come under even greater scrutiny strengthening the belief that he is building his defence around the wrong centre half terry also knows that his off field behaviour let alone his on field attitude towards officials will be closely watched
5957680 fabio capello will go into englands world cup qualification campaign with the same captain as his predecessor steve mcclaren and virtually the same team as favoured by sven goran eriksson supporters will hope that the situation is simply a reflection that england under performed under previous head coaches which is undeniably true but it perhaps also shows that after four friendly matches and eight months in charge capello has drawn the conclusion that there is a dearth of emerging talent
5957681 if all we have to go on is that capello is an admirer of terrys big personality then surely he could have discovered that by a much less roundabout route indeed if he needed to know that terry shouts and directs his team mates during a game more than any other england player then he could have wandered out into soho square and asked the first englishman he bumped into luiz felipe scolari appears to have taken all of about eight seconds to make up his mind that he would be keeping terry as chelsea captain capello has taken eight months to come to the same conclusion for england it did not help matters yesterday that capello insisted on persevering in a language of which he is not yet the master on reflection he should have taken the steve mcclaren approach to foreign languages and spoken italian with an english accent and let the excellent interpreter provided by the fa take care of the rest it made for an uncomfortable occasion for terry who on one occasion had to step in to clear up the mess of incomprehension left by his manager everyone looked fairly ill at ease
5957682 terrys appointment is bothersome because it means he will play every game terry is a fine premier league defender among the best in terms of making clearing headers and last ditch tackles but his lack of pace dictates that england defend far too deep when you face croatia or russia or brazil they dont generally play a 4 4 2 and lump it up front for terry to spend all day heading it away as he would against many premier league opponents playing the best in the world demands versatility and thats not something with which terry is blessed rio ferdinand is the much better all round defender and if you are going to build a defence around one man that man should be the best at that job terry should not automatically be the first name on an england team sheet so he should not have been given the armband that earns him that right
5957683 capellos bold new england may be beginning to appear suspiciously like the bad old one yet he remains adamant that his tactical outlook is where the difference with past regimes will be most keenly felt those arriving at wembley tonight for the friendly against the czech republic will be hoping to see evidence of the convincing game plan that will carry england through a world cup qualifying campaign which begins in just over a fortnight
5957684 this is the moment at which having a much decorated italian in charge of the england team comes into its own as john terry stepped up to the interview podium on the occasion of his second coronation as england captain it began to dawn on many in the room what a shrewd cookie fabio capello has been he has kept the same captain that steve mcclaren installed two years ago yet somehow contrived to make the appointment seem like his own he did not change for the sake of it nor bow to a budding army of moralists and the fact that another england manager a failed one at that had the thought first did not matter a jot that is what confidence does for you
5957685 so what swung it capello has talked of a captain in the mould of franco baresi his leader at ac milan and right down to his central defensive position in the team and his penalty miss at a final of a leading tournament there are similarities capello admired baresis ability to command the players under pressure to stay calm and give instructions to execute the game plan this is terrys forte too it is no coincidence that he was missing from the two matches in which england fell apart at the back at crucial moments in russia and at home against croatia
5957686 it is the creation of balance elsewhere in the line up that must take up most of capellos time there is a glut of midfielders and the present trend is to accommodate as many of them as possible with the smart movement shown against portsmouth on sunday chelsea illustrated that it need not be stodgy to have five of them in a team
5957687 hoffenheim who were playing in the seventh division 18 years ago and became the smallest ever club to grace the bundesliga finished their first game in the top flight on top of the table jointly with schalke energie cottbus their hosts on saturday had sent them 1 500 away tickets hoffenheim sent 1 451 of them back unsold yes 49 fans made the trip to the east to witness a historic 3 0 away win their distinguished counter attacking football had the purists purring and the traditionalists scared the hoffenheim benefactor dietmar hopp a software tycoon has given the other clubs 200 million reasons to fear the rise of a new superpower
5957688 what a mess thats a quick assessment of milans attempts to strengthen their backline over the last week while one should applaud and understand their interest in branislav ivanovic their decision to sell dario simic and dig o before securing the chelsea stopper was a mistake of calamitous proportions milan need to buy a new stopper rather than invent one and theyve got 12 days in which to do so maybe they need to give chelsea another call
5957689 is a fullback primarily an attacker or a defender its not an easy question and theres no right or wrong answer the word back might point strongly to the latter option but soccer is a dynamic sport and one of the reasons for its global popularity is that its open to so many different interpretations when the brazil squad is announced the players arent divided into defenders midfielders and strikers instead the categories are center backs fullbacks midfielders and strikers the fullbacks are in a category of their own because their function is unique the midfielders play narrow leaving a huge corridor on the flank which they are supposed to charge up and down

5957768 mi a fost foarte mila de el pentru ca este atat de mic incat ma temeam ca il va afecta anestezia slava domnului lucrurile au iesit cum trebuie dar mi a fost dor de el ca a fost si internat o zi a avut niste probleme destul de complicate la glandele lacrimare am fost cu el sa i scoata atele si acum e bine

5957770 i was real tight to cover skipping it around bushes docks deadheads
5957771 but the spots i was fishing were small depressions like a foot deeper than the areas around it
5957772 youd flip the bank and it was 2 1 2 or 3 feet but some places had one piece of cover a deadhead or a bush in a 4 foot depression that was huge
5957773 when conditions get tough and this was overall a super tough tournament
5957774 that tail makes the worm flutter down like a colorado blade
5957775 the water was kind of muddy and it just looked a little different and with that light weight the fish wouldnt let go
5957776 i never lost a fish on day 2 and i used a 3 0 yamamoto sugoi hook thats the perfect hook for when i was throwing to the outside or in between i went to a lightweight gamakatsu for heavy cover on day 4 and i lost two big ones out of heavy cover i went to flipping when the sun came out
5957777 i spent practice and 4 days in that one area i was just putting the trolling motor down and covering 50 miles and knowing every single spot i didnt even fish all my stuff
5957778 i think having a unitrack mind and not running all over the lake having confidence in the area i was in and not knowing what the rest of the lake had to offer i just had millions of spots in the same area
5957779 it was the vexilar flasher that thing reads in 2 feet of water and in practice it was key it allowed me to find all those slight depressions where the fish were
5957780 its loaded with fish you can catch 50 bass before 9 00 in the morning and any way you want to so you can learn new techniques really fast
5957781 it kills me every year i hate fishing for spotted bass i try to make it with largemouths and something always changes
5957782 i like to spend time with my family at home and just be around the house
5957783 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers
5957784 we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features
5957785 one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5957786 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalizing findings to the entire human population

5957820 so far our fluorescent sensor technology has been used in blood diagnostic cassettes worldwide if for example you have an accident and need blood an ambulance crew can analyse your blood at the scene and tell the a amp e unit to arrange for a certain type of blood with the necessary salt levels ready at the hospital for your arrival
5957821 now we have extended our sensor designs and discovered other possible uses one such use could be as an id tag for cells in an epidemic such as a bird flu outbreak from a population our sensor molecules could help track infection and highlight vulnerable people
5957822 also as logic gates are what drive current computers molecular versions of these gates open very interesting possibilities
5957823 it is exciting to think that these tiny molecules can perform small scale computational operations in spaces where semiconductors cannot go in spite of all their power

5957825 its taken 32 years before we have had any performance and thats a long time so any medal at this olympics is well earned you have to perform on the day and you have to be able to control your nerves because that is what it is all about every four years you get a chance to run and a lot of athletes cant cope with that and if youre 25 its your time it was his time and he performed on the day he withstood the pressure and ran extremely well
5957826 hes been amazing he has just gone and gone and gone and i think this one he was really gritting his teeth and going for it

5957829 thats 2 5 billion over a decade for one prison compare that to the cost of investing in sport and its pretty clear where our priorities should lie
5957830 its a whole other mind set when you are playing quarterback
5957831 you know where you are supposed to be and timing of the routes but when you are running the routes blocking and things like that its different i think its a little easier to play quarterback
5957832 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5957833 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5957834 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5957835 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5957836 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators of this fraud
5957837 on behalf of myself i can say with certainty matthew whitton and ricky dyer are not the best bigfoot trackers in the world
5957838 indias economy too has considerable dynamism and is moving up in terms of skills and technology
5957839 to stay in the game asean must become a strong and integrated region

5957847 i dont think there is another steel beam manufacturer until you get to florida
5957848 augusta iron and steel provides steel throughout georgia and south carolina and it just so happens to be that we are in their town this time
5957849 it is the largest dot project done in richmond and columbia county so it has an impact on a lot of the companies in this area
5957850 you think about us supplying products but youre talking about restaurants and hotels that are backing up a lot of these people because a lot of the workers are from out of town
5957851 next year if the economy does not improve we could see as much as a 3 percent reduction
5957852 the state has to make some cuts im real concerned obviously but were in an economic turndown at this time and were going to really have to tighten our belts
5957853 the local districts will decide how they will absorb those cuts
5957854 rather than being in a panic state i think that we need to be in an alerted state at this point and start looking at what we would need to do
5957855 the state board has indicated they would certainly entertain those waivers
5957856 we would have a cash flow problem if we didnt have our own reserves to pull from
5957857 were hopeful that the economy will improve but you plan for the worst and hope for the best

5957867 its important that our denomination be seen as one that welcomes people from all walks of life even straight males theyre no different from any of us really they just want to serve god and who are we to say they cannot fulfill that calling because of their gender or sexual orientation
5957868 our denomination is going to the dogs if they start allowing the ordination of straight males who knows what theyll allow next like freaks who use the bible
5957869 we plan to let those in charge know that were not pleased with this decision

5957878 be the king in the region dont take the second place
5957879 you can spend more than that but i dont think this is really necessary
5957880 that would be a newer and larger facility and it would have an advantage
5957881 a lot of research needs to be done you want your arena to be the best columbia countys arena would certainly hurt this arena
5957882 i just think if you had an arena downtown you create a sports and entertainment district

5957885 his answers were quick precise and to the point while obama was halting and appeared to be trying to make sure he didnt say anything that would offend any of his core base
5957886 on a couple of questions obama danced around and didnt even answer
5957887 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5957888 why isnt barack obama doing better against john mccain in the opinion polls
5957889 for a big part of the answer look no further than saturday nights forum at saddleback church

5957893 i like what i am seeing because he is making the players pass more patiently we are keeping the ball much better and i really liked the last game that we played where we kept it and we created good chances
5957894 i think bit by bit he is getting there for me what i like about him is that he is picking players in form he wont mess about if they are not in good form i think he might leave them out of the squad which he would do at club level anyway
5957895 he will also give young players here that play well a chance so he picks players that are in form and i quite like that
5957896 i think it was a very close choice and a difficult decision because i think both of them would be very acceptable captains
5957897 that for me is where it is very difficult for the manager
5957898 but in the end he has gone for john terry and i think he is an outstanding captain i think rio is an outstanding captain so whoever got the armband would be a good captain and whoever didnt get the armband will back up that captain so ive got no doubt that rio is disappointed but he will be as professional as normal
5957899 in recent months the ira has employed car bombs extensively often with devastating success but also with an apparently high risk to civilians
5957900 yes we intend to continue with the car bomb tactic because of the length of warning we give on a car bomb prior to its detonation if the enemy act on the warning theres no danger to civilian lives the car bomb is used on property only and this is accepted even by the british army and ruc it is not an anti personnel bomb thats why we give warnings it does not serve our cause to inflict civilian casualties and all our operations whether against military or commercial targets are planned and conducted with this in mind

5957906 the idea of doing a period piece where you dont modernize it you just realize how modern it was
5957907 in 1891 it was incredibly modern and sherlock holmes is such a great character to be able to play
5957908 i love the idea of doing a period piece without trying to be too stylized
5957909 were both martial arts enthusiasts and historically in the real origin stories of sherlock holmes hes kind of a bad ass and a bare knuckle boxer and studies the rare art of baritsu fictional martial art created by doyle for the final holmes story 1901s the adventure of the empty house if you look baritsu up they cant even really tell you what it is so it gives us a lot of leeway
5957910 here i am promoting a movie while my heart says i should not be promoting tropic thunder at all because i need to have my ham radio going for sherlock holmes its mandatory that i get this inspiration and what if i miss that train ill be depriving the moviegoing public of what it is that i promise them ill be able to do which is more often than not deliver
5957911 land availability has shown up on this survey for the first time ever you want to plan for smart growth
5957912 one of the most critical assets that were having trouble finding is land that does not have commercial and residential encroachment upon industrial parks
5957913 you keep hearing a lot about the economy the loss of jobs and impact of oil prices but weve actually got some hot sectors
5957914 plastics is a great area for us data centers are a growing industry we have over 12 data center projects right now
5957915 companies are going to want to follow that kind of market access and were truly blessed to have it
5957916 you get the ball and do what you want with it
5957917 we feel like hes right on target maybe a little further ahead
5957918 hes worked against greenbrier harlem and evans in the passing league its made him better
5957919 were trying to build a competitive program from the sixth grade on up
5957920 well the best laid plans do not always work out the way you think and it is what you do when they do not work out that defines you
5957921 i think after not getting the medal in the shot put and having to walk in front of the media and have to answer the question about what went wrong and how i feel is very tough for me i know deep down inside that i did the best i could with what i had but it is hard to express to others what i did not have on that day i guess this is one of those life lessons that can only be learned from experience and not being told
5957922 i was not quite where i needed to be technically on that particular day
5957923 i was a little off during qualifying but i was able to essentially hone it in for that one throw ive been pretty good for the last four years getting that one throw together
5957924 but i wasnt where i needed to be and i knew it going into the finals me and don babbitt his coach worked on it as much as we could but theres only so much you can do within that short period of time it kind of showed in the throws i guess i was kind of happy i was able to fight through as hard as i did to make it to the top eight but stuff like this does happen from time to time even to the best of us we just grow from it and get ready for the next competition
5957925 what i had to remind myself is its only important to the media it shouldnt be that important to me its played up more for the public and ive got to remind myself of that i cant let this one meet define either im good or bad its just any other meet
5957926 at that particular time i didnt really want to talk to anybody
5957927 i barely wanted to go talk to the media when i got done but you have to do that when youre in the position im in i just talked to them and once i got that over with i called my wife and talked a little bit and then went to get mcdonalds and to sleep
5957928 in athens i was a little more star struck where this time i was a little more focused in just going there and competing and potentially winning a medal
5957929 when people ask you are you going to sweep the answer has got to be no id rather be proven wrong that way than to go through it and definitely be proven wrong
5957930 it was great for our kids great for our school but i was worried more about how we lost four ball games in the last three minutes than how we beat aiken high school
5957931 we got into a situation where we were losing at the end of the games good football teams find a way to win instead of finding a way to lose
5957932 with these young kids i dont know what kind of mind set they have
5957933 he has grown up so much i knew last year the kid had talent
5957934 the kid has a chance to be something special theres no doubt about it he can throw the ball about as well as any quarterback ive been around
5957935 our goal is to be better than we were last night right now my concern isnt wins and losses
5957936 it dont matter until we get to the sixth game of the season which is when region begins if we can continue to improve day by day well be alright when it comes time
5957937 theres too much talent here in augusta i didnt expect this but its a good problem to have
5957938 i had a few guards that i knew could play but now i have at least four or five
5957939 i live in charlotte and i heard about the premier basketball league adding a team down here im just keeping my options open
5957940 we werent going to do this but by popular demand we might have to do one last tryout here in augusta
5957941 we are proud to partner with the state to bring this exciting professional golf event back to sierra county new mexico
5957942 as a result of the more tremendous coverage that last years shootout received people across the country and around the world saw that new mexico has a great golfing tradition and is rapidly gaining widespread attention as an excellent place to live and retire
5957943 our goal in hosting the shootout is to promote new mexico as a great state for golf
5957944 there are many well known courses in the state but also many that are not so well known we want both residents and visitors to learn about everything new mexico has to offer the golf enthusiast

5957947 flexicare represents a unique balance of quality and value the build quality the materials and even the packaging reflect the dedication of a company that clearly aims to offer a superior product
5957948 flexicares reputation among its european customer base as a reliable provider of high value disposables is a huge selling point
5957949 one of the most important factors in the success of a business can be location and it has proven true with us our donut referrals are the people that walk into our office from one of the restaurants next door they realize that we can help them with a website or marketing and come in for some info whether theyre managers of large businesses or entrepreneurs these clients are the largest part of the expansion of our local business outside of referrals from happy clients
5957950 it really does show that the tried and true marketing methods still work we provide the opportunity for people to come in and meet us in person which makes them feel comfortable with us from the start clients can look at our office space and meet a couple of our on site contractors we offer a free one hour consultation for potential clients so we can help them clarify their website needs during this consultation the client can get a good feel for our marketing expertise its one of the main reasons people hire us to handle their website design needs
5957951 weve got to tighten up the amateur program so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5957952 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5957953 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more

5957971 probably the most driven person i know largely rejected by australian government funding bodies he definitely seems to have the balls to put himself right out there without any safety net from what i gather he did have interest from the national geological association who were going to give him some dollars but pulled out at the last minute by which time his emotional trigger had been sprung and the train had no way of stopping so he sent his shipping container over to san francisco without having enough cash to pawn it out of the docks hes been winging it ever since i even sent him over 100 bucks for burgers at one point

5958034 weve designed our solar modules specifically for the electrical utilities scale market
5958035 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near portland oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5958036 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later
5958037 the electrical market is enormous to keep up with demand the utilities are reaching out for new power production methods that are clean and safe long term these power fields are great investments that can provide a 5 year payback on the average installation and then you have 15 years of cash flow with low operating costs we see this trend picking up significantly and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity

5958040 the pit is a reservable space for student and faculty groups
5958041 if no one complains we do not have a problem the whole campus is a free speech area but this is a reserved space for student activities
5958042 they asked if they could represent us and we declined
5958043 they didnt like that but we dont agree with what they preach
5958044 last year we could be there if one of three sections were unreserved
5958045 the new policy divides the pit in half and so they told us to leave
5958046 i know they are trying to get you to censor free speech
5958047 we hope if just one group is in the pit we can still be there but those are still untested waters this year
5958048 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5958049 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5958050 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5958051 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5958052 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5958053 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5958054 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5958055 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5958056 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5958057 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5958058 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5958059 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5958060 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5958061 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5958062 who are open to doing something on the production side
5958063 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5958064 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5958065 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5958066 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5958067 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5958068 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5958069 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5958070 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5958071 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5958072 man ikke ved hvor l nge man lever n r man er fyldt 75 s dan er vores regler
5958073 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5958074 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5958075 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5958076 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5958077 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5958078 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5958079 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5958080 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5958081 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5958082 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5958083 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5958084 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5958085 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5958086 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5958087 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5958088 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5958089 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5958090 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5958091 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5958092 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5958093 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5958094 i like what i am seeing because he is making the players pass more patiently we are keeping the ball much better and i really liked the last game that we played where we kept it and we created good chances
5958095 i think bit by bit he is getting there for me what i like about him is that he is picking players in form he wont mess about if they are not in good form i think he might leave them out of the squad which he would do at club level anyway
5958096 he will also give young players here that play well a chance so he picks players that are in form and i quite like that
5958097 i think it was a very close choice and a difficult decision because i think both of them would be very acceptable captains
5958098 that for me is where it is very difficult for the manager
5958099 but in the end he has gone for john terry and i think he is an outstanding captain i think rio is an outstanding captain so whoever got the armband would be a good captain and whoever didnt get the armband will back up that captain so ive got no doubt that rio is disappointed but he will be as professional as normal
5958100 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5958101 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5958102 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5958103 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5958104 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5958105 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5958106 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5958107 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5958108 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5958109 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5958110 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5958111 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5958112 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5958113 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5958114 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5958115 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5958116 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5958117 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5958118 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5958119 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5958120 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5958121 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5958122 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5958123 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5958124 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5958125 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5958126 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5958127 got nothing left but it aint bringing me down im just gonna follow the sound
5958128 true but weve got nothing to do waiting for our ship to come in or even sink something has to happen cause its later than you think theres got to be a way because nothing seems to last

5958140 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5958141 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5958142 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5958143 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5958144 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5958145 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5958146 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5958147 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5958148 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5958149 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5958150 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5958151 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5958152 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5958194 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5958195 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible

5958228 theres nothing bad coming we dont know if this means things will get better or worse
5958229 it was just the right time its been 15 years its time for me to do something different i like el paso i hope to stay here but well see i am proud of the staff and confident the times will evolve as the industry redefines itself
5958230 i thought the times improved under his leadership and it should have too they brought in more capability they can do color on almost every page now
5958231 the times in this market was probably doing what the times needed to be basically getting hammered from weeklies like us and niche publications
5958232 they had to go where i think they could have the most appeal and i thought they executed it fairly well
5958233 don leaves a very deep legacy in journalism at the times and nationally he was a true champion of diversity at a time when others gave it only lip service he was the first recipient of the apmes robert mcgruder diversity award and i cant think of anyone who deserved the honor more
5958234 in el paso don played a key role in better connecting el paso with state government at a time when many newspapers backed away from legislative coverage don was a firm advocate for making sure that el pasoans understood what was happening in austin
5958235 was a tremendous teacher to me and i have him to thank for where i am at today in this business because he and bob moore are the ones who decided to put me in charge of the metro desk
5958236 don had high standards and always saw possibilities for improvement he expected excellence he once told me when i was a little frustrated that i didnt realize how much he and i were really alike i came to appreciate that and realize how right he was when i moved away you dont know what youve got til its gone as they say i found that i expected excellence too and i missed having don there to back me up
5958237 i wish him well and hope that he will now finally have some time to put his golf clubs into the belly of a southwest jet and come visit me out here in las vegas
5958238 was an asset to the community he will definitely leave a void im sorry to see him leave
5958239 its not surprising there are changes in the organization newspapers are facing serious challenges
5958240 was president and publisher of the iowa city press citizen in iowa city
5958241 since joining the gannett company in 1985 he has held editing and management positions at the tucson citizen in tucson arizona the new mexican in santa fe new mexico the visalia times delta in visalia california and the gannett west in reno nevada
5958242 he was formerly an editor with the dallas morning news and has been an editor or reporter for the dallas times herald the abilene reporter news and the san marcos daily record mr flores professional memberships include the american society of newspaper associations of america and the national association of hispanic journalists where he has served as director vice president and president
5958243 i dont know whether he stands out personally as a bad editor or whether he was the kind of editor that gannett would need for a paper they didnt want to put any money into thats what seemed to me was the big problem with the times
5958244 gannetts conservative bottom line outlook and el pasos impoverished immigrant base are less than fertile soil for growing a strong and dynamic newspaper it doesnt help that the company man in charge does not appear sensitive to what makes el paso both special and tragic
5958245 so don flores is gone so what whos going to replace him thats the real question
5958246 rather than evaluating who the guy is and what he did the important question is did he resign because of something theyre going to do are they going to make it worse
5958247 compadre congratulations on another scoop regarding dons resignation youre doing a great job as youve done since our days together at the times keep up the good work

5958273 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5958274 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5958275 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5958276 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5958289 we provide educational and recreational activities to reduce the stress that palestinian children suffer from in addition to providing part time work for people who are unemployed
5958290 the goal is to help these children confront the results of violence
5958291 these activities will help huda to begin to heal but her suffering like that of hundreds of other children like her cannot be erased in two years
5958292 for two years i could not smile or even cry then i met huda and we began to move away from the pain and agony

5958298 ill try my best but its more complicated than we had thought
5958299 its a great idea but i have a couple of suggestions
5958300 some years ago i lent you 400 and i would like it repaid now
5958301 that to gather news it is often necessary to agree either not to identify the source of information published or to publish only part of the facts revealed or both that if the reporter is nevertheless forced to reveal these confidences to a grand jury the source so identified and other confidential sources of other reporters will be measurably deterred from furnishing publishable information all to the detriment of the free flow of information protected by the first amendment
5958302 to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries
5958303 grand jury investigations instituted or conducted other than in good faith official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt a reporters relationship with his news sources would have no justification
5958304 ok you look like a potential terrorist or sexual predator or drug dealer give me all of your personal belongings starting with your cell phone
5958305 well id spend half of it and save half of it
5958306 but just like michael phelps when my goggles get a little foggy i just close my eyes and reach for that wall

5958330 the russian forces are looting and plundering in zugdidi three russian soldiers stole a bag of food from an elderly woman
5958331 this guy is sitting on a beach 100 kilometers from georgia reporting absolute nonsense back to his paper
5958332 besides the shooting earlier today a passing vehicle opened fire at our troops near zugdidi luckily they ducked in time and no one was hurt
5958333 youve taken quite a few war trophies over there havent you
5958334 no i wouldnt say that but weve commandeered some valuable equipment three american de mining devices for instance we already sent them to our military bases our officers at home were quite enthused when they heard the news
5958335 did you know zugdidi was the capital of the criminal world in the soviet era
5958336 yeah the soviet unions most infamous thieves in law convened there regularly
5958337 the decisions they passed in zugdidi were accepted as rule of law for the entire soviet criminal community
5958338 tell us where our young boys are they went to fight the russians but only three have been brought back dead so where are the rest of them we were told theyre sitting in the forests waiting we have no way to contact them we think theyre dead maybe you burned their bodies how could you do such a thing

5958376 protein will win and that can then therefore drive you to over consume diets which are too low in their percentage of protein or indeed under consume and hence potentially lose weight on diets that are relatively high in protein

5958381 open up new marketing opportunities and help promote the wales brand
5958382 there is little evidence to suggest that a domain will have substantial short term economic benefit for wales
5958383 this announcement reflects a more strategic approach to put wales on the world map and enhance welsh culture and identity on the worldwide web
5958384 the internet is the e engine for economic growth and wales needs top level access to deliver the innovation that we need
5958385 the internet is about to change radically and wales must be fully on board the new internet with a top level cym on a par with other economically growing communities
5958386 most of our customers come from london the south east and scotland but for tourist companies its a great idea
5958387 i think it offers another option for businesses to consider which is never a bad thing
5958388 for companies for which welshness is a key part of their proposition to their customers it maybe a useful marketing tool
5958389 the trend is probably towards globalisation and the removal of local domain names there are more companies opting for com rather than co uk
5958390 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust

5958392 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5958393 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5958394 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5958395 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
5958396 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now

5958451 do these same democrats want every city and town that barack obama visits to be reimbursed for these very same expenses
5958452 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified
5958453 the support that sen obama is receiving in the host cities of both conventions speaks to the desire for change that reaches across regional and partisan lines
5958454 the city of denver is democratic but the state is obviously republican
5958455 i think part of it will relate to the fact that the convention is here and the democratic convention has been a real plus for obama in denver
5958456 but it is also a reflection that colorado is very tech conscious and obama reaching through the internet to raise money has played well here

5958463 the mere use of a blue ball pen is not such a grave error so as to warrant a caveat to be rejected outright

5958501 washington politicians should not be telling schools across america how many hours their students should work and in what kinds of jobs
5958502 we must encourage the corporate sector and the philanthropic community to provide funding for national service with federal challenge grants and other incentives
5958503 dedicated to building the capacity and effectiveness of the nonprofit sector
5958504 the investment in young peoples aspirations creates a triple bottom line
5958505 you not only invest and get an immediate return from their service but you help the community and you also get extraordinary benefits back to the person whos serving
5958506 its the people already on playing field the volunteers who are writing the checks
5958507 and many of them were involved in service as young people
5958508 we are really missing the boat on the opportunity to engage young people in an activity that shows that if we can engage them while theyre young that this will be paid back in the kind of engagement and the kind of philanthropy that has made america great in the past
5958509 is that service has a critical role to play in the kind of country we all want to live in and in the participatory democracy that is described by our founding fathers in the documents and government they created
5958510 theres a lot of pressure our owners theyre very successful people in other walks of life in the businesses that theyre involved in and believe you me they expect an awful lot of success in this one as well the first day that i signed i was told in no uncertain terms that promotion was expected and either youre with us or you wont be thats the day youre signing and its a lot of pressure to be throwing on a player they say all this to you with a straight face and youre thinking jesus but in a way its brilliant i enjoy being involved in the kind of club that expects success like that hopefully we can deliver
5958511 im very passionate want to do very well so hopefully ill get a chance
5958512 when i wasnt in the 40 i thought okay and went on my holidays
5958513 then while i was back in cork playing golf i got a phone call off fellow international martin rowlands at qpr saying youve got to be in dublin next week i was delighted
5958514 i remember euro 88 aged 7 remember watching it remember getting shoot magazine and stuff like that i massively remember italia 90 and usa 94 watching the matches on the big screen in douglas the whole country ground to a halt to think i could be part of something like that obviously if its a successful world cup campaign that people could be flocking to see the boys in green and i could be part of the squad well thats a huge motivation
5958515 im long enough in england to know that anything can happen and nothing should surprise me but obviously getting picked for this norway game shows that im in the managers thoughts and if i can impress then hopefully i might be part of that world cup qualifying squad
5958516 the managers been brilliant but marco tardellis been fabulous too
5958517 he came to our first game of the season against barnsley at loftus road i didnt even know he was there at the time and ive been talking to him about that so its great they make me feel welcome
5958518 ive watched both games on dvd since and there are a few things ive seen that i need to pick up on international footballs a little bit different to the football i play week in week out we played sheffield utd away last saturday theyre a big strong physical team and theres not many international teams that play like them but really i was just pleased to be involved in the internationals i just went out then and did the best i could if it worked out great if it didnt then at least id have failed giving it my best
5958519 theres denis irwin and roy keane and a few others too obviously im only starting out in my career with ireland but if i can keep involved and get a game from time to time then id love to be thought of in the same terms as those sorts of people it would be fabulous
5958520 its hard to see how they got themselves into that mess because theyre probably the best supported club in the country
5958521 back a couple of years ago they were getting massive gates so i dont know how this has all happened theyre obviously paying out too much money but i presume theyll get it sorted
5958522 our owners theyre very successful people in other walks of life in the businesses that theyre involved in and believe you me they expect an awful lot of success in this one as well the first day that i signed i was told in no uncertain terms that promotion was expected and either youre with us or you wont be thats the day youre signing and its a lot of pressure to be throwing on a player they say all this to you with a straight face and youre thinking jesus but in a way its brilliant i enjoy being involved in the kind of club that expects success like that hopefully we can deliver dean parrett still only 17 dean parrett seems to be settling in nicely at spurs and playing for england youth presumably if hed stayed at qpr he would have played for the first team by now by being at spurs hes presumably receiving better coaching and playing alongside and against better players and obviously a lot more competition for places at spurs spurs official site dean parrett all action midfielder joined our academy full time at the start of the 2008 09 season impressive displays at junior level have already led to both under 18 and reserve representation at the club as well as being a regular for england under 17s dean made 17 appearances for our under 18s in 2007 08 scoring three goals and played in our three fa youth cup ties he also made one start and one substitute appearance for our reserves
5958523 what is the most memorable moment of your career a signing for qpr as a kid i always supported liverpool but my best mates granddad used to be chief steward at qpr signing pro was what i always wanted to do
5958524 we are delighted to be able to tender our resignations from the board of queens park rangers football club in order to assist in the changes set to take place this week we believe the new investment coming into the club will be the most important for years will save qpr from the perilous financial position we have found ourselves in over the past years and should put the club in an excellent position to move forward we would like to thank gianni paladini in particular for attracting this important new investment and we are delighted he will stay on as chairman of the club gianni has had a difficult job keeping the club going but he has pulled off a master stroke in bringing in this new investment we are also deeply grateful to antonio caliendo and franco zanotti for both financing the club over the past years and for the terms upon which they have agreed to assist with the new investment we are certain the new investors and the new board will get behind john gregory and give him the support he needs we are also positive that the fans can get behind a new board and continue in their loyal and unrivalled support for the team it has been an honour for all of us to serve this great club and we are grateful to all the staff and supporters we have had the pleasure to work with

5958532 his temples are slightly indented which indicates that he may be compulsive about work and needs regular exercise to de stress but it also shows he is highly disciplined and that spirituality plays an important part in his life
5958533 his eyebrows show his tremendous drive and the ability to take on the difficult work his lower eyelids indicate genuine care for other people a mole near his nose indicates that this is a man with a special purpose in the world
5958534 overall the most impressive information seen in her face is how deeply she really cares about others and how she wants to help people she views the country as one family there are so many places on her face which reveal that her main motivation in her work is to help others
5958535 the shape of her face shows tremendous strength hillarys forehead indicates shes very creative in problem solving her cheeks reveal both a strength and a challenge her inherent desire to speak her mind her prominent cheeks are the feature that can make some men have a negative reaction to her as subliminally theyll feel shes an overpowering and threatening woman
5958536 the most important feature on his face is his very heavy prominent jaw
5958537 this feature combined with his somewhat narrowed deep set eyes show he is not so comfortable expressing his emotions and he will need to suppress his feelings until he explodes into anger or upset

5958546 though he was rich yet for your sake became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich
5958547 derives its moral authority from a womans right to choose safe and legal abortion
5958548 a notable omission is the clintonian phrase safe legal and rare replaced by a more honest and modest goal of reducing unintended pregnancy through better health care family planning and comprehensive sex education sex education was not even mentioned in the old platform
5958549 the progressive pro life desire to see the platform commit to reducing abortions was subtly undercut this year the platform merely recognizes that sex ed family planning and good health care will have the effect of reducing the need for abortion
5958550 in all other areas the platform uses strong language of commitment the party strongly and unequivocally supports roe and strongly supports access to affordable family planning services
5958551 even the platforms support for pre and post natal care and income support for women who have children is properly framed as a right on its own and not as a means to reducing the need for abortion
5958552 the biggest disappointment the ppers pro life progressives acknowledged about the platform was that it did not moralize about abortion but jim wallis took solace in the belief that the plank makes room for people with moral convictions about abortion as if those of us who support the right to choose have no moral conviction that undergirds our respect for choice

5958560 a lot of laws have not been interpreted or defined in a new country and you can assume that whatever you want the law to be it is unless it is proven otherwise so of course we put the most progressive spin on it
5958561 the more we say it the more people get to believing it were changing the norm first they laugh and then they start repeating it
5958562 pro life womens groups should be rejected because theyre anti choice and theyre also anti equal rights they dont support equality
5958563 this is a group that is anti choice anti gay does not support equality for women and wants to obliterate the department on the status of women

5958703 es un tema delicado todos estamos obligados a cumplir la ley y a acatar las sentencias lo que ocurre es que si se multa a un alcalde deber a quedar muy claro que ha habido voluntad evidente y manifiesta de no acatar la orden judicial algo que por lo que se me ha informado ocurre exactamente en el caso de mart torres

5958734 the united states pakistan relationship is going to become stronger as a result of musharraf leaving the scene

5958736 at different levels of being discredited the united states was holding onto a very narrow base which was not good for pakistan and not good for the united states

5958745 the support that sen obama is receiving in the host cities of both conventions speaks to the desire for change that reaches across regional and partisan lines
5958746 the city of denver is democratic but the state is obviously republican
5958747 i think part of it will relate to the fact that the convention is here and the democratic convention has been a real plus for obama in denver
5958748 but it is also a reflection that colorado is very tech conscious and obama reaching through the internet to raise money has played well here
5958749 denver has always been more progressive than many other metro areas in the intermountain west

5958760 our data shows most consumers dont think it is possible to pay less than 150 a night for a four star hotel this might be an accurate price for consumers purchasing through other travel sites but by booking four star hotel rooms on hotwire you can actually save yourself a tidy sum of money hotwire has four star hotel rooms in major cities often times for under 99 a night

5958766 an analysis of the number of tourists travelling to finland from january to april this year shows that indians seem to prefer the warm finnish summer months over the winters
5958767 in january this year 4 684 indian tourists went to finland while the number went up to 5 789 by april
5958768 and the response this year has been even more heartening if you compare the number of indian tourists who went there between january and april last year and this year you will see that there is a leap of 50 6 percent
5958769 of course online booking cannot widespread within the country just from the efforts of foreign airlines unless the local airline industry supports the whole innovation process

5958771 the bandh shutdown has affected banks insurance central government offices and the railway traffic
5958772 the impact was felt in the places where left affiliated trade unions are active
5958773 several passenger trains have been stopped at bhadrak balasore puri cuttack and bhubaneswar
5958774 there are no two opinions about the need to switch over to other modes of power generation like nuclear energy and hydro coal based power production has to be restricted
5958775 coal based power generation is not a feasible proposition coal stocks are limited and might not be there always to generate power at such a large scale
5958776 from april 2007 to january 2008 around 255 million tonnes of coal was supplied to power utilities against the annual action plan target of 249 97 million tonnes
5958777 the situation is grim and unless fast track measures are undertaken by the ministry of coal and coal companies the ntpc stations face serious threat of taking units out of bar
5958778 which is why we have advised the ministry of power to retain the target of importing 20 million tonnes of coal for power plants in 2008 09 it will help them build up coal stocks at power houses
5958779 a long term solution to meet increasing electricity needs lies in switching over to hydro and other renewable modes for generating energy
5958780 all flights scheduled before the shutdown took off but the 80 odd flights scheduled within the shutdown tenure have been postponed till tomorrow thursday we have informed passengers earlier so that they dont have to face any harassment

5958783 the daily wage earners are the worst affected because of these strikes
5958784 we should protest through discussions rather than going on strike
5958785 these strikes hit the image of the state definitely work will be affected we are closing operations for the day and are talking to clients to re schedule work
5958786 though it is a nationwide strike but this is happening in west bengal only the others units of the company situated in various part of the country are functioning normally
5958787 it is unfortunate that strikes only happen over here it projects a negative image of the state
5958788 an analysis of the number of tourists travelling to finland from january to april this year shows that indians seem to prefer the warm finnish summer months over the winters
5958789 in january this year 4 684 indian tourists went to finland while the number went up to 5 789 by april

5958791 we have been working on the series 60 platform for touch screen user interface and a mobile device is expected to be launched by the year end
5958792 the new software would allow licensees to develop devices with a variety of input methods such as touch screen with traditional keypad qwerty keyboard or standalone touch screen supporting both finger or stylus optimised input
5958793 with the acquisition of symbian we will be able to offer our customers more innovative products and the latest technology
5958794 symbian is the largest mobile phone software developer globally and it is up to our customers to decide how popular and accepted our software is
5958795 the strings move around a lot making me think theyll break quickly the white grip it comes with turned nasty pretty quickly are my hands this dirty and the string bed has kind of a dead feeling to it now that didnt effect the control or power i got both of which are nice and an improvement over the other turbo shark which had an out of control power feel
5958796 this wasnt too different from the o3 white and from the baseline had all the things i like power but not out of control placement and the ability to easily hit deep balls instead of coming up short which i guess depends on your stroke from the baseline it is dependable like the rest of the o3 line
5958797 i enjoyed the o3 hybrid shark against players i could push around a little bit but against big hitters who came at me it was a little much
5958798 unless youre playing 5 0 big hitters all the time i would recommend this for players from 2 5 4 5 looking for some immediate improvement from a high tech racquet such as this definitely an improvement over the turbo shark
5958799 the face is really responsive and gave my serve a little boost
5958800 grips the ball well as all princes do no lack of spin solid on the serve typical prince and the giant sweet spot makes even balls hit near the outside of the face find their mark
5958801 to me the power was nice but i didnt feel like i was hitting as heavy a ball as i wanted
5958802 for serving in the o3 series i like the o3 white the shark has plenty of pop whether hooking serves down the middle or going out wide for spin and hitting flat
5958803 a lot more feel for me that the turbo shark an improvement of power with control
5958804 i thought the muted feel of the string bed would take away from the serve but it didnt other than sometimes having a problem with serves that sat up my flat serves went long until i made some adjustments then it was fine there is no lack of power
5958805 if the o3 technology truly makes the sweet spot 50 percent larger this is the racquet you can feel it with
5958806 even off hit returns had good power and with a little extra topspin i got the control i wanted i could hook the two handed backhand with control
5958807 the maneuverability of the racquet makes it easy to get around on slice and topspin it has the power to push people around on their own serves
5958808 against big servers i had plenty of juice to come back at them with even if blocking the ball
5958809 for a racquet of this level it does a lot more for me that the turbo shark did
5958810 i can drive the slice low and float it less and take big cuts on the returns if i put a little extra topspin on it when servers jam you it has the power and control to poke balls back low or at angles to give net rushers problems
5958811 i thought the extra length might give me some problems at the net but it was comfortable and controlled
5958812 plenty of power control was adequate when i tried to get cute
5958813 it gets around quick at the net and the feel of the racquet makes you want to beat on the ball
5958814 i found myself wanting to come in behind topspin drives rather that try to place an approach shot i was crunching volley winners maybe i was just having a good day or maybe it as the racquet
5958815 for the muted string bed i thought there might be a power outage at the net but it performed well
5958816 the maneuverability made me almost want to go for the volley winner on the difficult shots instead of setting up the point keep a firm wrist and control though or the balls can fly
5958817 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5958818 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives

5958828 if duke enters into settlements in other states that are more favorable to consumers i believe duke would prefer to have similar conservation programs in other states
5958829 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5958830 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5958831 so far our borrowers are doing pretty well but im anxious for them a little bit
5958832 im depressed for those communities we have helped to build up
5958833 we have one focus and that is to get the neighborhood stabilized
5958834 find vacant properties and put into them families with weak credit and let them rent for three to five years
5958835 but it may help pilot something that can be applied on a bigger scale

5958876 every american has the constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
5958877 every american has their constitutional right to a fair trial and every american has the right to be judged by a jury of their peers and not the media

5958921 i like what i am seeing because he is making the players pass more patiently we are keeping the ball much better and i really liked the last game that we played where we kept it and we created good chances
5958922 i think bit by bit he is getting there for me what i like about him is that he is picking players in form he wont mess about if they are not in good form i think he might leave them out of the squad which he would do at club level anyway
5958923 he will also give young players here that play well a chance so he picks players that are in form and i quite like that
5958924 i think it was a very close choice and a difficult decision because i think both of them would be very acceptable captains
5958925 that for me is where it is very difficult for the manager
5958926 but in the end he has gone for john terry and i think he is an outstanding captain i think rio is an outstanding captain so whoever got the armband would be a good captain and whoever didnt get the armband will back up that captain so ive got no doubt that rio is disappointed but he will be as professional as normal
5958927 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation

5959021 the existence of the culture of impunity in kenya and the need to remove this shield
5959022 there was organization and method to the violence the attacks and counter attacks were carried out with military discipline for example attackers in the rift valley participated in oathing ceremonies and donned a semblance of uniform their attacks anticipated the need to mobilise reserve forces to assist the main attackers
5959023 the violence was largely instigated by politicians throughout the campaign period and during the violence itself via the use of incitement to hatred

5959034 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5959035 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5959036 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
5959037 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5959038 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population

5959046 they must acknowledge a dangerous and painful truth key leaders of pakistans military and its inter services intelligence agency have long collaborated with armed islamic extremists operating in afghanistan the indian province of kashmir and pakistans own tribally administered regions along the afghan border in their eyes these extremists serve pakistans strategic interests in reality as the times has extensively reported these militants kill american and nato soldiers indian diplomats and pakistani civilians
5959047 it will take personal courage and broad political support to clean up these forces and finally bring them under civilian control pakistans leaders will better their odds if they stop pretending that the fight against terrorism is somehow americas problem and not pakistans they will also have to stop pretending that ad hoc cease fires and bribes to insurgent leaders can roll back the taliban threat
5959048 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties and rule by decree
5959049 two things are important in spreading micro credit in india one is legislation to create micro credit banks small banks who does this lending of micro credit to the poorest people and then a regulatory authority which oversees this operation

5959054 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5959055 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5959056 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5959057 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5959070 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5959071 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5959072 our information is specific to being in an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information

5959080 it made me think of how lucky i am that nothing bad happened that night to me or to anyone else drinking and driving do not mix
5959081 one of the things i have learned from this is that if we are going to party
5959082 we need to have someone with us that can help make good choices someone who can say dont do that
5959083 do unto others as you would have them do unto you

5959111 we are into the application for the leave to appeal its up to the supreme court to grant leave
5959112 its really an issue of proper principles of statutory interpretation i see that as the flaw in the judgment
5959113 i believe it will be a steep uphill battle to contend with the carefully reasoned judgment of the ontario court of appeal in any leave application
5959114 every compromise and arrangement done under the ccaa almost by definition affects contractual or proprietary rights it happens in every restructuring under the ccaa the legislature could not have been more explicit in its intention than by using this very broad and encompassing phrase compromise and arrangement this is what the court of appeal found and they are clearly correct

5959127 the pacific islands forum also has expectations about good governance
5959128 it has expectations that fiji will keep its word and what weve heard rippling out of fiji over the last day or two is that fiji not only doesnt intend coming to this meeting but it is starting to float the possibility that they might leave the forum altogether
5959129 its refused to do that and instead has started floating that it could leave altogether
5959130 the relationship between the forum and fiji is very frosty because people feel let down

5959161 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
5959162 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5959163 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5959164 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5959165 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5959166 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5959167 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5959168 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5959169 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5959170 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5959171 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5959172 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5959173 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5959174 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia

5959179 how can i bear to watch the destruction of my family
5959180 to stand by and watch to be a passive witness a disengaged spectator
5959181 i was young and now am old and i have not merely stood still and watched when the righteous was forsaken and his children forced to beg for bread
5959182 then why dont you ask your mathematics professor why he is not a triangle or a trapezoid

5959184 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not even negotiate it is impossible to advance any conversation

5959186 i tend to agree with your assessment of the seriousness of this situation but a lot of people dont james andrew lewis argues that theres no such thing as cyber terror which i personally consider to be a naive and dangerous approach that simply splits hairs in a diplomatic attempt to not undermine lives lost in bombings and conventional terror attacks

5959249 in the event of military action by an enemy no one should expect iran to refrain from using every available means of self defense including closing the strait of hormuz with a view to damaging the invaders interests closing the strait of hormuz is part of irans defense policy in face of the u s military threat
5959250 the strait of hormuz is one of 14 locations in the world with unique strategic importance
5959251 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5959252 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5959253 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5959254 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5959255 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5959256 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5959257 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5959258 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5959259 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5959260 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5959261 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5959262 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5959263 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5959264 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5959265 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5959266 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5959267 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5959268 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5959269 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit
5959270 after years of abuse the memoir has found its white knight galloping in to show how a personal story can be engrossing shocking and true
5959271 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5959272 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5959273 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up

5959275 there be no further discrimination or segregation in the pews at the communion rail at the confessional and in parish meetings just as there will be no segregation in the kingdom of heaven
5959276 set an example founded on religious principle and is responsive to the social conscience of our time
5959277 serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
5959278 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm
5959279 as catholics we need to take a much tougher and more self critical look at ourselves as believers at the issues underlying todays erosion of catholic identity and at the wholesale assimilation absorption might be a better word of catholics by american culture
5959280 do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good acceptable and perfect
5959281 the catholic faith is much more than a set of principles we agree to but rather an entirely new way of life people must see that new life being lived they must see the joy that it brings they must see the union of the believer with jesus christ p 190
5959282 the teaching of vatican ii exists first and foremost in the council documents themselves no interpretation of the council has merit unless it proceeds organically from what the council actually said and then remains true to it
5959283 christ fully reveals man to himself and makes his supreme calling clear
5959284 we need to root the social dimension of our catholic faith and everything else we do in gods love which is the fuel for our mission of evangelization we cant offer catholic social action to the men and women of the world without at the same time offering them jesus christ
5959285 the catholic church is a web of relationships based on the most important relationship of all jesus christs gift of himself in the eucharist for our salvation none of us earns the gift of christs love none of us deserves the eucharist
5959286 what needs to be done by catholics today for their country
5959287 the answer is dont lie if we say were catholic we need to prove it americas public life needs people willing to stand alone without apologies for the truth of the catholic faith and the common human values it defends p 197
5959288 therefore put away all falsehood speak the truth each one to his neighbor for we are members of one another
5959289 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
5959290 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5959291 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5959292 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5959293 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions

5959341 the rally was triggered by market talk that the authorities will launch favourable measures to buoy the market such as trade on credit or stock index futures said yan li an analyst from southwest securities

5959348 a doctor who works with addicts at north americas only supervised injection site says health minister tony clements slam against physicians who support the facility is
5959349 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5959350 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
5959351 has become a merged version of lost in translation and groundhog day
5959352 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
5959353 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed

5959355 it will not be dedicated to occidental art but will show all kinds of artistic creations
5959356 it will set up a dialogue between west and east between north and south as such art from the middle east will be shown within the louvre abu dhabi
5959357 subjects and themes have been freely discussed with our partners in abu dhabi and no request to avoid such subjects has been made
5959358 the exhibition policy will be set up regarding excellence and high standard quality as a new museum we hope the louvre abu dhabi will be part of the international community
5959359 the whole project will benefit from the excellence of louvre staff and it will be consistent with the reputation of the louvre name
5959360 its a big challenge for the louvre as for all french museums
5959361 the louvre abu dhabi will be a completely new institution but supported by the strong cultural expertise of french institutions and of the louvre in particular
5959362 deeply change the way this location will be looked at and how itll be considered
5959363 the work done since has been both to inform people in france and to strengthen the scientific and cultural side of the project
5959364 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
5959365 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
5959366 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock
5959367 what its showing is that theres a great deal of concern about the solvency of these companies
5959368 consumers are not likely to make very large ticket purchases when prospects in the labor market are weakening and confidence remains very low
5959369 i tell them not to sit down unless we are told to
5959370 we just want to keep them all warm and ready to enter the game because everyone on this team contributes
5959371 we arent ever going to be the tallest team on the floor
5959372 but we play really good defense and i think we are one of the better serving teams around so that helps too
5959373 we really just are able to rise to situations like that because we are all so close all best friends so we really start playing well for each other and helping each other out
5959374 we didnt have to take time to build up team chemistry we came in ready to compete and ready to go out and win
5959375 stratford is going to be really good but they havent played a tournament yet so they just havent been able to get the same kind of match experience we have already this year

5959385 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5959386 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5959387 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families full report

5959390 obviously when you get a chance to play somebody like favre with the legacy hes built you got to get up for it i enjoy it i got an opportunity to sack him last year in a regular season loss im looking forward to getting another one
5959391 brett favre is very special i like hitting quarterbacks equally it dont matter if it was
5959392 as ive said all along they deserved it not only in our game the way they played throughout the playoffs
5959393 believe me i wanted to win the game i give them a tremendous amount of credit but that is over and done with obviously this is a new year and a lot of things have changed
5959394 its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back
5959395 the only reason i came back is i wanted to play
5959396 i have no idea id like to have that opportunity to make that decision
5959397 i mean that with the highest compliments first and foremost his experience there is no substitute for experience
5959398 ive seen a lot of guys come and go with tremendous speed who can jump high who could bench press more than anyone in the locker room but could they play football when its all said and done that is the most important thing
5959399 we talk all the time l c has been great in meetings great in everything weve asked him to do hes been perfect
5959400 our receiver talent here is a lot like what i played with in green bay
5959401 young quick guys and each one of them offers something a little different than the next we have four five guys that can easily make big plays at any time i like it
5959402 we absorbed the dividend by cutting back on services or core functions or restricting the conditions of service that are offered to staff
5959403 that budgetary strategy runs the risk of diminishing our effectiveness as an accountability institution imposing a costly danger for government that problem areas in administration are not properly targeted
5959404 this year the impact of the efficiency dividend is just over 2 million which in our language and in a way the committee will understand thats about five performance audits a year
5959405 we are in the stages where the efficiency dividend is now no longer coming out of efficiencies but is impacting directly on programs that we are delivering

5959414 its crucial you want to go into the finals with a fair bit of momentum but i think for the whole season weve built a fair bit of momentum over 12 months
5959415 the last few weeks have been a bit disappointing but weve got plenty of time to get it right

5959424 there were many tears among them as i was discoursing publicly but no considerable cry yet some were much affected with a few words spoken to them in a powerful manner which caused the persons to cry out in anguish of soul although i spoke not a word of terror but on the contrary set before them the fullness and all sufficiency of christs merits and his willingness to save all that come to him and thereupon pressed them to come without delay
5959425 it was surprising to see how their hearts seemed to be pierced with the tender and melting invitations of the gospel when there was not a word of terror spoken to them
5959426 the word made powerful impressions upon many in the assembly especially while i discoursed of the blessedness of lazarus in abrahams bosom luke 16 22 this i could perceive affected them much more than what i spoke of the rich mans misery and torments and thus it has been usually with them they have always always appeared much more affected with the comfortable than the dreadful truths of gods word and that which has distressed many of them under convictions is that they found they wanted and could not obtain the happiness of the godly
5959427 the young ladies living at tennyson center have had very limited opportunities in life to learn social skills
5959428 however they have made great strides just by the fact that they have survived some pretty rough situations including abuse and neglect

5959430 fmm is dismayed that after five months of detention purportedly for the purposes of investigations by the tid the attorney general has only been able to frame charges against mr tissainayagam on such manifestly insubstantial and absurd grounds as these
5959431 it appears that the authorities are desperately attempting to manufacture grounds on which to prolong the incarceration of mr tissainayagam using legal provisions that can only be described as oppressive
5959432 the pta not only undermines universal principles of procedural justice and confers inordinate powers in the hands of the executive it also directly undercuts the freedom of expression and the media by allowing content control by the executive on pain of penal sanction
5959433 it represents nothing less than an attempt by making an example of mr tissainayagam at the suppression of alternative viewpoints and dissent open debate and the contest of ideas central to the democratic way of life
5959434 it also represents an attempt to silence media professionals into submission through the use of anti terrorism legislation
5959435 we made sure that visitors could arrive and depart from sydney without any fuss
5959436 whether it is the 2000 olympics the 2003 rugby world cup apec in 2007 the fifa world congress or world youth day in 2008 sydney airport has shown that it has the capacity aviation infrastructure and highly skilled staff to deliver major events
5959437 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
5959438 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5959439 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5959440 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
5959441 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5959442 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5959443 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5959444 i dont think scott prince is a liability at any stage hes a great footballer who has shown great courage
5959445 princey was prepared to break his arm for us last weekend and that gives you strength and determination to dig deep
5959446 it makes you think youre not going too bad when youve got a guy in your team with a crack in his arm whos prepared to keep turning up for you
5959447 you do your best but these days theres not many places to hide out there
5959448 the cowboys found him a couple of times on the weekend and princey made his tackles
5959449 hell get a lot of confidence out of last weeks game in terms of putting his body in front of people and im sure hes prepared to do it again
5959450 we like to think whether it be princey or anyone else we are there to cover up any mishaps we have and we take that philosophy into the game
5959451 we know what were going to get out of scott and hopefully he knows what he is going to get out of us
5959452 it says a lot about scott he would do that
5959453 its not only what he does on the field its what he brings to our whole dynamics
5959454 having that year off definitely helped the body out i was able to fix a few other things up as well
5959455 just being away from the club i didnt have to go to all the meetings and that through the year it just freshened the mind up as well so hopefully at the end of my career it might add one or two years on there
5959456 its obviously a massive milestone something im very proud of but i probably wont appreciate it until i retire and realise just how hard it is
5959457 we need to win the next few games and thats all were going to be focussed on if we dont win this weekend its fair to say we wont be playing finals
5959458 once you get to 200 games it means youve been around for a while
5959459 he and browny havent played together a lot the last three years
5959460 in terms of their goal scoring as a pair theyre very good and daniel individually has certainly had his best year goal kicking in terms of his consistency
5959461 were playing for everyone involved in the club the playing staff coaching staff and mainly our loyal supporters who continue to turn up each week
5959462 it doesnt matter where we play last week it was freezing out at penrith and our fans were still there so hopefully we can give them a win
5959463 for us weve just moved on from it a few weeks ago so we just want to train and do our thing and thats all well worry about
5959464 obviously the guys coming in theres some great signings there and weve got a lot of young kids coming in as well who are outstanding talents and weve seen a few of them in first grade this year
5959465 the futures looking good but for us the playing group and the coach we want to finish 2008 on a good note
5959466 certainly theres not many players available now and theres certainly no other sonny bill williams floating around
5959467 when you ask most players how do you judge your career especially tiger they are judging their careers by how many majors they have won
5959468 i think two majors by mr harrington thats very impressive i dont know what hes done the rest of the year but winning both majors in the hardest conditions ive ever seen on both golf courses thats toughness defined right there and i think hes got my vote
5959469 i mean tiger won four out of the six tournaments he played in and you look back at ben hogan in 53 played five tournaments and won four of them three of them were majors i think we all know that if he played the whole year he would be player of the year
5959470 if i was going to vote today i would probably vote for padraig because he won two majors
5959471 mark has always had an amazing will to win and a great depth of character
5959472 hes always had the ability to play well in big matches and do big jobs on the best small forwards going round but then be able to go forward and kick goals
5959473 if we dont win this game and we scrape into the eight is it really worth being there
5959474 its a milestone to make the semis and were going for some kind of record i think its 18 in a row but we want to finish as high as we can
5959475 well be disappointed if we dont finish in fourth or fifth spot
5959476 i read somewhere you would need 30 points and weve only got 27 points so we need to win two of our next three to be sure of it
5959477 the gold coast can still make it and a number of other teams can still make it
5959478 weve got our side back if you like on friday night for the first time in a few weeks and apart from stevie michaels knee i dont think theres anyone else who would make the side
5959479 its important to us to win start showing some cohesion and get on the train for the semi finals
5959480 having karmichael back and justin back and tunza carroll and greg eastwood just adds that much more to the team and i expect the team to be in top form on friday night
5959481 i hate that traitor brett favre ill buy anyone a drink who can kick the favre rag doll through the goalposts
5959482 frank guess you dont have enough money to travel to the cowboys packers game in
5959483 you can have my tickets for the broncos jets game nov 30 at giants stadium
5959484 i wont go see that packers traitor brett favre hes a piece of dog poo
5959485 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5959486 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5959487 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5959488 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5959489 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5959490 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
5959491 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5959492 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
5959493 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5959494 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
5959495 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5959496 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5959497 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5959498 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5959499 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5959500 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5959501 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with o negative blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
5959502 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
5959503 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was

5959523 los angeles aggrolites brought some much needed veteran reggae power to the afternoons events which were dominated mostly by loud and fast upstart punk groups
5959524 the aggrolites decked out in matching blue dickies that suits their working class music to a t probably won a few fans of what they call
5959525 we cant wait to perform an entire aggro set back home and may even have a few surprises
5959526 there is a perception problem in the broader media about boxing
5959527 the negative aspects of the sport are always reported how many times have you heard that boxing is dead or dying
5959528 that message needs to change i think its a sport you should check out for yourself if you havent been a fan for awhile come back and check it out youll find out that the excitement that you felt for the sport once is still there
5959529 it diminishes the audience for your biggest event can you imagine what would happen if the

5959542 we believe that 2015 plan was an agreement that was made
5959543 we planned based on that agreement and if the agreement was changed wed be hurt
5959544 it would be tantamount to asking us to take legal action

5959574 it is an urgent need as we tackle changes in the international economic situation as well
5959575 earlier this year i directed the department to clear a backlog of about 13 000 temporary skilled migration visa applications on hand since march many of which were outside the acceptable standards for processing
5959576 applications for temporary skilled visas are now being processed faster and more efficiently at three new dedicated centres of excellence established in perth sydney and melbourne to deal with increasing demand by australian companies for overseas workers to meet skills shortages
5959577 employers in australia have to cast a wider net to bring talent in or back in to the country
5959578 a collective effort to attract and retain talent particularly accounting and finance professionals in australia will help all employers and take some much needed pressure off the sector

5959583 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5959584 guys understand that for the betterment of the game weve got to keep our feelings intact but once you pull on the australian jumper and see the ball you just never know whats going to happen i guess
5959585 so its just a sense of obviously pull yourself back at times but when the balls there in your area as competitive as all of us guys are usually we just go 100 per cent and you just see what happens
5959586 none of us go out there to intentionally hurt an irish player its just a contrast in the sports
5959587 being professional we are a lot stronger than what they are whereas they probably read the game a lot better
5959588 when you pull on that australian jumper its a weird sort of feeling you sort of get that sense of playing for your country and youve got the whole country looking at you so it is pretty fiery
5959589 i think in the last series the irish gave as good as they got but i suppose with all the press that came along with what happened with the last series we might have to tone it down a little bit

5959591 with regard to the crane accident itself it is highly unlikely that a march 4 inspection would have prevented the horrific accident that happened on march 15 which we are still looking at the probable cause being mechanical failure or human failure during the jumping operations when the crane was raised
5959592 we thought it was important to file charges on this discrete issue to assure that this accident is being thoroughly investigated for any criminal charges but also from the citys perspective to determine if d o b followed all proper procedures
5959593 we will not tolerate this kind of behavior at the department of buildings since september 2002 we have been working closely with d o i in an
5959594 i do not and will not tolerate any misconduct in my department
5959595 somebody called 311 because they thought something was wrong if the charges were true and the inspector didnt even inspect the site how are we supposed to have faith in our public servants and in the d o b inspectors we dont know what this inspector would have seen and seven lives were lost in this tragedy

5959625 shes got such good ball skills and is very speedy
5959626 but we cant concentrate solely on her their whole team is fantastic were excited about it
5959627 abby was not only one of our best players but she was also a leader and you cant replace that
5959628 but so many people are picking up some of the pieces for us our scoring has become more unpredictable
5959629 well see how he plays next year and well revisit it
5959630 this does not change our position on drafting him or his future with us
5959631 our staff was excited and surprised to get him in the second round hopefully they were right
5959632 hes an american but at the end of the day im my own man
5959633 so i am going to go out there and try to win
5959634 you got to believe the first step in winning is believing i believe i can do it

5959648 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5959649 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5959650 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5959651 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5959652 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5959653 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5959654 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5959655 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5959656 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter
5959657 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court

5959661 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5959662 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5959663 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5959664 anybody that knows me that knows what kind of guy i am they know im a hard worker

5959687 the group can transform into money the intelligence information it has acquired with the publication policies they have been following they can also acquire finances from people chosen as targets
5959688 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5959689 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dimitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5959690 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable

5959888 the state department is working at the necessary agreements to achieve some passage in the straits of turkey and things like that
5959889 surface vessels give us the capability to provide larger amounts of relief supplies and they also give you the platform to operate off aerial assets vertical lifts those types of things

5959895 trintechs performance in q2 was solid with revenue growth of 18 and adjusted ebitda net income of 215 000 despite the challenges of the economic environment however the continued uncertainty in the market has negatively impacted our revenue and earnings results and business outlook for the rest of the year our management focus will continue to be on driving revenue growth and ebitda profitability while extracting cost synergies from our recent acquisition of movaris and maintaining a strong vigilance on our operating cost base given our outlook for the business following shareholder approval of our share buy back at our recent agm we intend to initiate the purchase of our stock as our board strongly feels that the current trintech share price does not accurately reflect the true enterprise value of the business
