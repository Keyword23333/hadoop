7350167 jay is going to a costume party tonight and he needs something that looks like blood only fake
7350168 the teenie weenie black mask the cheap shiny wrinkled shirt the tight really really tight tights and the sexy cape are just just amazing
7350169 im just saying that ive never seen you in that posture before ive seen a few women like that but no men outside of porn and certainly not you i didnt really expect it to affect me so much though i suppose thats predictable
7350170 i enjoy our little naked coffee klatches but if you would just fuck me already
7350171 after all thats a position of pretty intense sexual submission the back of your neck is bared your spine is arched your ass is presented
7350172 theres a great deal of evolution going into that pose and my reaction to it i dont know how you could make that more animalistic if you tried well actually i do know
7350173 there now you couldnt make that posture any more arousing you could of course beg but you wont thats not your style
7350174 dont worry jack i dont think theres a chance in hell youre not getting fucked this evening
7350175 and it would certainly be good if that worked for you
7350176 keep your eyes open jack its a good sight my hand on your cock
7350177 id like to fuck you now no dont move that posture is still the hottest goddamned thing ive ever seen id love to keep you like that open you with my fingers watch you fuck yourself back on them id like to watch that for a long time but i really dont think i can wait so youd better relax quickly
7350178 no you really should stay how you are i could keep fucking you like this and you would love it you would absolutely love it but you wouldnt be able to come from just that would you
7350179 i could keep fucking you as hard as i wanted as long as i could stand and you would just ride that wave and moan and pant just like youre doing now maybe eventually you would beg and when i was done you would still be like this crazy with want you would still be presented to me open for me to play with ready to do anything i wanted you to even after id used you
7350180 jack your whole body just shook at that that was amazing
7350181 honestly i thought you hated it when i talked it was starting to give me a complex actually

7350183 perhaps these things like dogs infection might increase the size of the tonsils
7350184 its not clear how the dog and the large family is associated with snoring
7350185 certainly individuals who are exposed to sever airway episodes have recurrent ear infections live in large families where infection is common and have a dog may be more likely to develop an immunologic response in the airways leading to tonsillar and or adenoidal enlargement and narrowing of the airway leading to snoring

7350187 im sure well have to spend more the first thing is for sparc to do a review for government on how the actual targeting of the high performance and most likely medal winning sports actually went and then have a look at whats a realistic budget
7350188 i dont have a feeling for how much more but what i know is that to do well at the olympics you cant just be the gifted amateur
7350189 you do need that total focus you do need all the support that we can wrap around our athletes
7350190 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge
7350191 the achievements we have made in this are a very important driving force for the future
7350192 but we have to be modest and sober minded and we have to face the difficulties and challenges in the process of future development
7350193 we are still lagging behind in many events or disciplines in terms of medal count and in terms of the number of athletes who ranked in the first eight we are still lagging behind compared with many developed countries

7350210 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7350211 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth

7350223 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7350224 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7350225 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7350226 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7350227 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7350228 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7350229 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7350230 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7350231 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7350232 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7350233 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets

7350236 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008

7350276 she is going to strongly encourage everyone to support obama
7350277 upon arrival one of those inmates in question actually went to the washroom and jumped out a window he was arrested after a short foot pursuit
7350278 very limited force was used to make the arrest and no intermediate weapons were used which means that we did not use a taser or pepper spray and we did not use the baton
7350279 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7350280 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7350281 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7350282 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7350283 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth
7350284 obama traveled to pakistan using his indonesian passport at the time of travels to indonesia obama was 20 years old he was well aware he maintained his indonesia citizenship and failed to regain his united states citizenship even if obama maintained his united states citizenship which he failed to do he also carries citizenships in kenya and indonesia obama has divided loyalties with foreign countries thus obama carries multiple citizenships and is ineligible to run for president of the united states
7350285 if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship
7350286 the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so the dncs inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary
7350287 no one in high point is exempt from knowing someone who might have mental health problems
7350288 it might be your brother sister neighbor child or someone at work
7350289 we have tremendous services to offer and a tremendous staff that is very dedicated to providing services for members of the community who have mental illness
7350290 good food good fellowship great fun and a great chunk of change
7350291 we want to educate people about the issues of mental health and how they are being addressed locally
7350292 the further we go in the system the more needs we uncover
7350293 law enforcement tells me there was an increase in commitment papers filed in 2007 and they are seeing more and more people with mental health problems in emergency rooms and in homeless shelters the good news is that guilford county offers more services than several other counties the county is doing a good job of maintaining some of the critical services and contracting others
7350294 there is not one single person working or volunteering at the association who does not have a heart for the mentally ill
7350295 we are at a place in our history that they are able to live more normally than at any other time we know what to do if we have the means to do it the real message as a community is to decide whats important what our response is going to be my confidence is that our area is going to make the most humane choices
7350296 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7350297 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7350298 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7350299 this knee has been giving me a lot of trouble its stiff all the time
7350300 we have treated people that were hearing voices and not getting the medication they need
7350301 they go to the emergency room when we are closed because they cant be turned away
7350302 it is a problem its a waste of resources and it frustrates the emergency room doctors
7350303 but it is not something we ask on a regular basis unless it is related to what we are treating
7350304 the hospital wouldnt put anybody out if they didnt have a safe secure place to go
7350305 if we know a patient is homeless we certainly take that into account for their treatment options
7350306 again if the patient doesnt reveal those things to us we have no way of knowing
7350307 it is not necessarily the fact that they are homeless that concerns us
7350308 its the factors that led them to be homeless such as the lack of a social support structure or the lack of medical insurance
7350309 its unstable that is the key thing that defines it
7350310 if you dont have a strong mind you would lose it over there
7350311 youd be discouraged too if you were looking for housing and employment and nothing was coming your way
7350312 there are pre med students and brody students that want to do this
7350313 anytime a doctor signs up within a day the volunteer list is full
7350314 its very frustrating because i feel like im begging doctors to come supervise us
7350315 they experience the exact same problems as other people in eastern north carolina its just that they dont have insurance
7350316 they come to us for ibuprofen and aspirin that four dollars may be dinner for them
7350317 they are very thankful because they know we are trying to help them and it gives them a sense of pride that they are helping with our education
7350318 the difference between making love and having sex with the girlfriend
7350319 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7350320 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7350321 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7350322 i think everyone deserves the honor and credit they receive
7350323 c gives you enough rope to hang yourself c also gives you the tree object to tie it to

7350325 i believe that no matter what you do no matter how hard you try you can not baptize cats
7350326 ik hoop dat zij de daad bij het woord voegt en meteen de subsidiekraan voor die milieufundamentalisten dichtdraait
7350327 wij worden als politiek geacht het algemeen belang af te wegen en dit soort clubs vecht alleen voor het zogenaamde hogere milieubelang we moeten meteen stoppen met geld voor die verenigingen
7350328 het is terecht dat minister cramer de vereniging nu waarschuwt
7350329 maar we moeten ook weten dat de subsidies goed worden besteed als een onderzoek feitelijk onjuist is moeten we overwegen of de subsidie terecht is gegeven
7350330 ik ben het ermee eens dat milieuorganisaties niet met eenzijdige informatie moeten komen maar daar is op dit moment ook geen sprake van
7350331 de democratie moet zijn eigen tegenmacht organiseren bovendien hebben verenigingen als natuur en milieu en milieudefensie een groot draagvlak onder de bevolking met hun miljoenen leden

7350334 today is another important victory in the fight to preserve equal access to opportunity as was the case in oklahoma and missouri ward connerlys misguided and divisive effort has again fallen short this time in arizona in light of the staggering disqualification rate that the secretary of state found in its review of the signatures the curtain has been pulled back on connerlys attempts to abuse the democratic process
7350335 when they said this year that there was a possibility theyd team up the two creepiest bad guys i got so excited i had a list of people i wanted to work with and he was on it
7350336 its been an interesting dynamic were both jockeying to be in the lead position but im not going to give anything away
7350337 in the first two episodes just dont blink or youll miss a lot there is more action than youve ever seen at once before

7350367 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7350368 this is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war against a russia that is re emerging as a great power only to find nato squatting on her doorstep

7350380 she is the best in the world ever sic in heptathlon but she chooses to compete in being fucked in the ass and if im not mistaking theres no medal in that so instead of winning one gold she and the swedish olympic committee agrees that its better she end up at 40th position instead well done sweden well done if i have to compare it to something similar its like rafael nadal all of a sudden decides hes a bit tired of tennis and wants to play badminton instead im so sick of the olympic games no more please im happy its every 4 year
7350381 y qu carallo hasta yo s reconocer una se al tan evidente
7350382 encouraging subsistence farming is another way of taking kenyan farmers out of the international market chain and confining them to poverty african countries will not become food secure by having enough food in their granary but by having enough disposable income in their pockets to buy the food they need
7350383 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7350384 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7350385 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7350386 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7350387 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7350388 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7350389 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7350390 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7350391 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7350392 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7350393 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7350394 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7350395 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7350396 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7350397 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7350398 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7350399 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7350400 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7350401 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7350402 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7350403 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7350404 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7350405 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7350406 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7350407 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7350408 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7350409 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7350410 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7350411 realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
7350412 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7350413 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7350414 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7350415 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7350416 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7350417 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7350418 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7350419 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7350420 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7350421 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7350422 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7350423 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7350424 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7350425 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7350426 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7350427 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7350428 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7350429 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7350430 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7350431 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7350432 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7350433 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7350434 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7350435 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7350436 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7350437 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7350438 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7350439 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7350440 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7350441 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7350442 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7350443 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7350444 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7350445 the club have confirmed that defender micah richards has been released from hospital tonight after being stretchered off during citys 3 0 victory over west ham united earlier today
7350446 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7350447 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7350448 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7350449 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7350450 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7350451 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7350452 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7350453 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7350454 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7350455 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7350456 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7350457 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7350458 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7350459 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
7350460 in good conscience i just cannot go there our current budget crisis is preventing students from attending california state universities we are laying off state workers and teachers continue to receive pink slip notices in fact californias unemployment rate has reached 7 3 percent i will be spending every day of next week urging my colleagues to finish the budget and to complete the remaining legislative work we have before us
7350461 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
7350462 cina berhasil meraih lebih banyak medali emas dan as meraih lebih banyak secara total saya yakin setiap negara akan menggunakan cara yang terbaik untuk mereka menentukan posisi di olimpiade satu negara akan berpatokan pada medali emas sementara yang lain berpedoman pada jumlah medali total dan dengan itulah kami berpedoman
7350463 jika anda mau menghitung dengan cara itu maka akan ada lebih banyak atlet individu as membawa pulang medali emas di leher mereka dibanding negara lain
7350464 perolehan medali cina begitu impresif karena mereka mengikuti 15 cabang olahraga sementara 34 medali emas yang didapat amerika datang dari 14 cabang
7350465 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7350466 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7350467 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7350468 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7350469 use technology for good and it will make you feel good
7350470 akoha is based off aboriginal gift economies and its a pay it foward giving game whereby you earn points based off how well you give to other people so aside from the functional this is a social network
7350471 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7350472 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7350473 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7350474 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7350475 the students parents teachers and staff in schools that performed admirably as well as those schools that continue to show improvement are to be commended and should be encouraged by these results
7350476 i know that the human being and the fish can coexist peacefully
7350477 you have to do a column every week like with a deadline
7350478 i dont know no wait i can do this once a week really ok wait i can seriously let me think about it

7350481 the first solo novel by larry nivens building harlequins moon 2005 coauthor portrays the thoroughly convincing human colonial society on fremont a dangerous planet rife with vicious predators frequent earthquakes and falling meteors distinctive characterizations well limned interrelationships and the vividly realized fremont contribute to an exciting coming of age story with a strong message about the evils of prejudice
7350482 fans of both hard and softer psychological sf will welcome veteran niven and newcome coopers well written tale of a 60 000 year layover in space in which physical challenges of world building are matched by the social challenges of collaboration among disparate groups
7350483 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7350484 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7350485 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7350486 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7350487 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7350488 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7350489 you know nathan it really is a shame here i am in a beautiful palace everything a king could ask for and god is still living in a tent isnt it dreadful
7350490 do whatever you think is best the lord is with you
7350491 im glad there are daily struggles in my life if there werent i wouldnt spend as much time in prayer and in the word
7350492 for this reason you are great o lord god for there is none like you and there is no god besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears
7350493 now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or imagine according to the power that works within us to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever
7350494 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7350495 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7350496 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7350497 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7350498 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7350499 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7350500 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7350501 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7350502 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7350503 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7350504 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7350505 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7350506 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7350507 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7350508 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7350509 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7350510 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7350511 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7350512 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7350513 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7350514 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7350515 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7350516 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7350517 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7350518 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7350519 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7350520 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto

7350522 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it said clarke who was an inspiration to the last european side by winning all his three games just weeks after his wife heather died of breast cancer
7350523 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7350524 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7350525 it was a good effort but all credit to darren mcginley said
7350526 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7350527 i dont think it will be fair to his family because junior enlisted just dont make enough money

7350532 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7350533 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7350534 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7350535 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7350536 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7350537 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7350538 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7350539 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7350540 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7350541 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7350542 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7350543 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7350544 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7350545 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7350546 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7350547 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7350548 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7350549 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7350550 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7350551 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7350552 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7350553 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7350554 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7350555 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7350556 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7350557 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7350558 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7350559 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7350560 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7350561 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7350562 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7350563 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7350564 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7350565 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7350566 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7350567 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7350568 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7350569 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7350570 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7350571 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7350572 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7350573 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7350574 we gonna play fast we gonna play loose and we gonna play for each other
7350575 senator with all of the stress of washington im surprised you would add golf to it

7350580 hey let me get this bag out of the way it might help the mouse hide
7350581 i think investors are attracted to that kind of problem the main obstacle is money at this point if i had some serious investors i think that could all happen very fast we could have production set up and running in the next calendar year
7350582 i very much want to keep it what i call laid and made in minnesota
7350583 my house is wall to wall eggs and my 13 year olds they have to eat out on the deck
7350584 thats not going to be very comfortable come a couple of months from now
7350585 i always say as difficult as raising twins triplets and a disabled child were starting a business is far more difficult

7350604 after years of repeating the same mistake of washing my hair with chemical loaded shampoos it finally dawned on me that it was the chemicals that were to blame for triggering dandruff and sebum discharge on my scalp nowadays i have a better alternative i no longer use shampoo i would pour instead a canister of baking soda solution on top of my head letting the liquid flow down to other parts of the body then i would take my shower showering has never been the same ever since nowadays i feel so fresh after a shower no more sticky or oily deposit on the skin the phrase that goes as clean as a whistle has begun to gather meaning you see i have sensitive skin my skin reacts quickly to certain chemicals it interprets the chemicals as dangerous bacteria consequently the skin would produce its defense substance just underneath the skin near that place if this substance exists in a large quantity it could pose a health problem it could cause itchiness worse than that it could attack my skin from underneath causing eczema for years the substance has successfully ruined the follicles of my hair causing hair loss but that does not happen any more the baking soda solution that i pour onto my head neutralizes this substance the solution has also a secondary task it dissolves away chemical deposits left on my body by decades of prolonged use of shampoo and soap the result is a scalp that is healthy and a body that is clean there is no more dandruff and no more unpleasant body odor what makes me especially glad is that my hair remains where it should on my scalp

7350635 you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7350636 i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7350637 whats the matter didnt pick so and so because they spoke the truth when they constantly criticized me for every policy position i made
7350638 i have been a fan of wyclefs for many years from his work with the fugees to his success as a solo artist
7350639 hes a fantastic writer singer producer and performer whose music crosses genres and touches peoples lives i am specially impressed by wyclefs dedication to humanitarian causes and his strong sense of character i was so happy to meet wyclef and work with him on our iconoclasts episode but not even in my wildest imagination did i expect that such a beautiful song would be one of the outcomes from meeting wyclef he is an amazing human being and it is truly an honor for me to be recognized in such a wonderful way by such a gifted musician and exceptional person
7350640 there was risk in his returning to the team i think there was undue pressure placed on him in his career that i assured wouldnt be there under us i told him that i dont need you to lead or be the captain just to set the ball the risk on our part was if we went down the path of having lloy set again and we didnt get on the podium fool me once shame on you fool me four times im not sure what happens after that
7350641 i always made fun of people after theyd win an nba championship or something and say i dont know what to say it hasnt sunk in yet
7350642 but id say thats kinda stupid why would you say that now here i am saying the exact same thing i dont think until i get home and sit on my big sofa in front of the tv with the medal still around my neck a cold beer in hand and realize that after this long time im an olympic champion that itll sink in its always one thing to be called an olympian youre an olympian for life but to be called a gold medalist i dont know what goes on top of a cherry on a banana split but it goes on top of that
7350643 its not physically demanding like the opposite or outside hitters its more of an intellectual thing

7350649 we have information that the fish which perished have been gathered with a net and buried in pits in the dam area this move is illegal the procedure that should have been followed which is provided by law is that veterinary services should have been called to oversee the process of waste collection and management by a licensed company as it is considered animal waste
7350650 there are potential dangers for public health as well as for the environment because of the risk of pollution therefore the appropriate procedure should have been followed
7350651 we have asked the relevant authorities to conduct research on why a state department acted illegally the research should show exactly how the process of burying the dead fish took place how many fish have perished and who is responsible
7350652 the dam was left to turn into a marsh the necessary steps were not taken to preserve life in the dam water should have been added as well as better oxygenation to preserve the organisms in the dam

7350659 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7350660 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7350661 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7350662 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7350663 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7350664 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7350665 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately
7350666 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7350667 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7350668 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7350669 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there

7350674 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7350675 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7350676 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7350677 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7350678 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7350679 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7350680 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
7350681 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7350682 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7350683 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7350684 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7350685 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7350686 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7350687 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7350688 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7350689 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7350690 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7350691 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7350692 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7350693 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7350694 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7350695 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
7350696 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
7350697 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7350698 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7350699 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7350700 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7350701 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7350702 but if we came from them why are they still around
7350703 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out

7350754 anyway it is a reflection of the diminishing political significance of the iraq war that barack obama who secured the democratic nomination in part by making much of his opposition to the war and his plan to withdraw our troops on a fast schedule is now able to pick as his running mate a senator who voted for the invasion in 2002 and whose favored solution would have required more rather than less american involvement in iraqi domestic politics
7350755 some people have trained themselves to believe that the only kind of success worth having is overnight success that if you dont hit 1 the first week youve failed that if your interface isnt perfect out of the box or if you dont get 5 000 people standing in line at the opening of your new store youve failed the challenge for observers investors and partners like the publisher who took on kathleen is to avoid the temptation of buying the media infatuation with the overnight success story which rarely happens overnight the challenge for marketers is to figure out what daily progress looks like and obsess about that

7350794 to find articles under specific topics or headings or you might find interesting entries by looking through the
7350795 he wasnt listed in the starting team and also wasnt listed on the bench
7350796 i knew that he was warming up before the game so i just asked the referee and roar coach frank farina what was going on they told me he was having a test i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7350797 i was pretty pleased with the way we played both first half and second half
7350798 but as i said to the boys weve got to close those games out if were serious about doing something this year those sorts of ones youve got to close them out when youve got them on the ropes like we had them youve got to do it now particularly with the cancels we had
7350799 little things like gazs tackle and matt prior it just gives you a chance to hold where you are and then we score and it takes you to 22 6
7350800 the difference between 16 12 and 22 6 is obviously a huge advantage because the scoreboard builds pressure more than anything else
7350801 thats what helps you get into a position to do well and win games
7350802 the good stuff that gaz did the pretty stuff and coops scored the nice try that comes on the back of all that other stuff
7350803 we had a couple of really good chances early in the second half where we just couldnt finish them off
7350804 there was just too many mistakes we became bumbling fools by the end of the game
7350805 im probably the most unemotional bloke ever and i saw mum and i couldnt really cuddle her because i was about to well up in tears
7350806 shes going to think i brushed her i kind of gave her a half cuddle and kept walking and said i gotta go im going to cry
7350807 its not a sad day its happy i was very appreciative of how the fans have been to me throughout my career down here
7350808 guys like myself and jason weve never been anything but the merger so its always been just the dragons to us weve always had two home grounds
7350809 im not going to be a smarty pants but weve got to get over port adelaide
7350810 there were lots of good efforts theres still some improvement in us because of the talent weve brought into the side
7350811 we missed matty campbell today and there were some really good performances but also there were some performances that werent up to the standard required
7350812 it wasnt our best game of footy it wasnt our worst it was a workmanlike effort against a pretty good team and a pretty good result
7350813 i thought north melbourne were pretty good pretty honest they turned up and they played but we just seemed to have their measure for all of the day
7350814 i havent really given it any thought at all weve got round 22 to come against essendon
7350815 its obviously pleasing for the club but coaches tend to be so short term so we discussed after the game what we did well what we need to improve
7350816 obviously its an important seven days to recover and we feel we really need to keep improving our football
7350817 thats what today was about against a really really good opposition
7350818 its an important prize to have i still think home ground advantage exists in the competition its becoming less but it still exists
7350819 theres that plus it would be nice for us to be able to get it just from our own supporter base for them to be able to see a home final
7350820 at the moment the guys are just incapable of coming with the required intensity to compete at afl level the way that its played now
7350821 the good thing is we can put ourselves in a position if we keep winning we dont have to rely on anyone else losing really
7350822 well do the same again next week weve got to reassess our injuries and weve shown all year that we play for each other no matter what weve gone through and that will be the case again next week
7350823 this is three years in a row this has happened in the last month and were finishing about the same 10 or 11 wins we cant get past that were going to have to move some players on simple as that
7350824 the way it was played it was one touch football it was free flowing and it was exciting
7350825 it was a great finish i think you see that in the premier league it was a great advert for the a league tonight and hopefully the fans saw that
7350826 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch
7350827 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7350828 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7350829 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7350830 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7350831 and when johnny comes back and poppa captain and centre back tony popovic comes back and forward brendan santalab well have a bit more speed because santa is lighting quick
7350832 it just gives us different options and we need to play different ways against different opposition
7350833 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch it was fun on the sideline to be honest
7350834 giving them two easy goals but then coming back was great
7350835 and then to lose it with a free kick like that was hard to take because i thought we were dominating the game at that time
7350836 it would seem that our lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak we are half hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered to us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cant imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased

7350838 in alle reguliere gestichte en goed opgezette loges bevindt zich een punt in een cirkel waarin een vrijmetselaar zich niet kan vergissen deze cirkel ligt ingesloten tussen het noorden en het zuiden door twee grote parallelle lijnen deze ene stelt mozes voor de andere koning solomon op het bovenste gedeelte van deze cirkel rust het boek der heilige wet die jakobs ladder ondersteunt de top reikt naar de hemel en waar wij bekend zijn met het heilige boek en aanhangers zijn van de doctrines die het bevat zo waren deze parallelle lijnen dat ook het zou ons leiden naar hem die ons niet bedriegen zal nog zal hij aan misleiding ten deel vallen
7350839 de drie grote pilaren die de vrijmetselaars loges ondersteunen zijn symbolisch voor de goddelijke eigenschappen ze stellen verder solomon voor koning van isra l hiram koning van tyrus en hiram abif solomon koning van isra l voor zijn wijsheid om het toewijden bouwen en afmaken van de tempel van jeruzalem als dienst aan god hiram koning van tyrus voor zijn kracht om hem te steunen met manschappen en materiaal en hiram abif voor zijn curieuze en meesterlijke vakmanschap om de tempel te versieren en te verfraaien maar omdat we geen nobele orde in de architectuur kennen voor de namen van wijsheid kracht en schoonheid refereren we ze aan de drie meest gevierde de dorische ionische en corinthische

7350856 theyd play scrabble and drink and crack jokes and crack jokes and argue frank always won and he was always very braggadocio about it too it was all jocular they didnt get polluted drunk and frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7350857 stan had been promising to bring barry by because we all had that in common franks kids were half white stans grandson was half black and my son was half black we all had that in common and we all really enjoyed it we got a real kick out of reality

7350870 i think i might be farming on a different planet were talking about a few intensive acres and ill be selling my stuff direct not through a brokerage or a distributor its possible that ill get 10 times those prices by selling to local markets here
7350871 this is my first year in business i dont have three years of records yet
7350872 do you get many people like me calling you up and asking for loans new young farmers who are selling direct and local
7350873 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7350874 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7350875 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7350876 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7350877 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7350878 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7350879 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7350880 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7350881 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7350882 we did our best but the best was not enough
7350883 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7350884 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone

7350891 every time hollywood makes a dog movie the breed goes to hell
7350892 the unscrupulous breeders will see theres a profit margin there
7350893 i look at us on paper and what we have returning and that makes me feel positive about what we are able to do this year
7350894 weve got a core group weve got a returning setter weve got a lot of returners from last years team back
7350895 jules has had a great spring in coming back from her injury
7350896 shes worked really hard in rehab and has consistently been ahead of all of her rehab goals so shes really put in the time and effort in the training room to come back i thought by the end of the spring she was close to where she was in the fall so shes made a lot of progress off the court shes obviously very anxious to get back out on the floor again and shes done a good job working on the little things like her passing game shes always been a big power hitter and shes worked hard on the things that are going to be necessary for her to get where she wants to go if she wants to be all conference be an all american player and help us get back to the tournament again
7350897 i think the big question for us as a team will be defensively and passing
7350898 obviously with out of the picture somebody has got to step in and kind of take over that position and thats what we are going through in the preseason give everyone a shot and see what everyone can do so weve got to find that first pass and that role of libero is critical
7350899 vann is kind of the energizer bunny for our team
7350900 she provides a lot of the spark a lot of the fire for our team shes a great competitor i thought she had a great freshman year last year as an understudy for tate and shes been working very hard during the off season to put herself in that position to take over that libero spot shes got big shoes to fill but shes one of the hardest working kids weve got in the program and i think shes a real competitor and will do what she has to do to try to be that libero to be that person that will play that position
7350901 pip is going to be somebody we look to contribute right away said kreklow
7350902 pip came out of a very good club and was a setter in high school and a libero for her club team her 18 and under team finished fifth i believe at the u s junior national tournament last summer shes a great little defensive player shes got good quickness she reads well and has a great feel shes very vocal and upbeat shes somebody we anticipate we play quite a bit in her freshman year
7350903 annie also came out of a great club program annie is another one that has a great natural feel for the game she reads well shes extremely quick she has very quick feet moves well shes got a great platform and is a very competitor shes not as vocal yet but thats often typical for freshman shes a great first passer and is just a phenomenal little defensive player shes another one we anticipate seeing a lot of playing time this year as a freshman
7350904 wendy is one of those players that when you look at your typical big 12 players shes not the big imposing middle blockers that you see so often but shes got such a quick arm and shes such a smart hitter that she proved over the course of last season that shes very difficult to defend
7350905 i thought she had a great second half of last season
7350906 she really came on during the month of november and into tournament time and did a real excellent job what weve worked on during the spring has been her individual defense and blocking i think shes got a good grasp of what is required of her as a setter and i look for that to improve
7350907 amanda really had a great second half of the season last year
7350908 amanda was somebody that us as coaches was very impressed by the improvement that she made and she had a great spring for amanda its always been the mental side of the game more than anything shes got great lateral quickness a fast arm and has always been competitive i think what held her back a little bit was her tendency to make unforced errors and sometimes lets that affect her mentally i thought the last half of the season last year she made tremendous strides hitting percentage went way up unforced errors went way down and she started to play like a veteran if she can continue that again this season i look for her to have a very good year and shell be a main part of what we do
7350909 with megan weve been very pleased with the progress that shes made
7350910 again it was the second half of the season last year things started to fall into place for her i thought she started to play with a lot more maturity and a lot more confidence megan has been that one player in the program over the past eight years that has probably played more positions than anyone weve had shes very versatile when jules went down with the acl we had to move megan from the right side and put her to the left so early in the season shes playing a position that shes never played before by the time we got to the second half of the big 12 season she started to get more comfortable over there and developed into a pretty consistent attacker i felt like the big bonus in putting her over there on the left side was that her block on the left side was probably more of a factor to the teams success than her hitting shes worked very hard all spring to improve on her attacking i think over the summer hard work in the weight room has paid off shes in great shape shes jumping well and i think shes playing with a lot of confidence i look for her to have a great year attacking on the left side to go with her block
7350911 catie i thought last year as freshman did a good job of coming in during a tough situation and playing well on the right side for us
7350912 its not an easy position to play you know theres a lot more to playing right side than just putting up a block youve got to handle the ball youve got to help defensively i think catie is worked hard during the offseason and worked hard during the summertime to develop her strength and athletic ability a little bit and has become a little bit more quicker and faster over there catie is also another intelligent player while she may not have the jumping ability and quickness in that position i think shes done a very good job in using her knowledge of the game to put herself in position to make plays when she needs them
7350913 as a team weve got two returning middles weve got megan and jules back on the left side weve got catie back on the right side lei setting i think the other big question mark is who will be counted on for that other right side swing
7350914 i think we are trying to bring the freshmen up to date as quick as we can trying to make them contributors as quick as we can it will be interesting to see how all of that unfolds
7350915 lauren has not had a lot of playing time and has not seen the court too much but laurens main contribution to us so far has been on a daily basis in practice and in the weight room just being a great team player shes got a very good attitude she works hard i think she raises the commitment level of the team when shes around i think she sets a very good example and when you have players like that in the program i think they may not get on the floor as much as theyd like but there still very valuable people to have
7350916 that was somebody we heard about late going into her senior year actually we just got a heads up from somebody we knew that saw her high school team play and said look youve got to go see this girl play we went to go see her play and we were incredibly impressed by her athleticism her skill level and experience in the game of volleyball is relatively low because she never played club or had the benefit to play club and getting a higher level of experience and training but shes got a very good grasp of basic skills and i think athletically shes one of the best pure athletes weve ever had in the program and weve had some good ones so thats saying a lot she jumps out of the gym shes got good size shes got quickness and agility shes got a great personality and attitude and i think brittany is going to be somebody that before her career at mu is over she has the athletic ability to play at an all american level we look for her to contribute very early in her college career
7350917 allison is somebody that we think has the potential to develop into a very good front row player obviously shes got great height i think what intrigued us about allison is that her lateral movement for someone who is so young and has that kind of height i think she has the potential to develop into a very good volleyball player here at mizzou strength is an issue for allison but i think once she gets the benefit of a strength program and the consistency of training that shes going to make big strides i think what you look for in a player like allison is one do they have the movement skills even though they dont have the strength to dominate matches
7350918 being on the road that much is going to be a challenge as well i think the only way you get better is to challenge yourself and challenge the team
7350919 over the years you take a look at different scheduling philosophies and i think it helps going out and playing people
7350920 you do have to keep everyone on board with the notion that the purpose of doing that is not to see if we can be in first place after the first weekend or the second weekend but rather use that as preparation tools for the conference season and november

7350968 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time

7350993 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7350994 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7350995 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7350996 if it was proved they cheated we would have a right to be upset

7351009 cuba is one of the last places not surfed in the world its probably like bali was in the late 1960s
7351010 in the rest of the world surfing has lost its soul it has become very competitive everybody is so hyper here is different
7351011 those who donate the boards know what its like to be sitting on the beach watching the waves without being able to surf
7351012 all those who come to cuba bring some things and at the end leave even more than expected because they realize we are good people they even leave us clothes
7351013 when i went into military service for example i gave my board to another surfer
7351014 thats the way it is with everything even with a piece of wax
7351015 we surfed about a week with waves between six and eight feet it was perfect
7351016 even now we go to the beach and there are people who say to us youre leaving take me with you
7351017 we know from reports in magazines that surfing is young in cuba and they need international contact to improve their skills

7351019 ceos across companies and industries have become focused in 2008 on the critical role that customer experience plays in keeping their companies competitive and driving profitability these same ceos are challenging their cmos to move beyond crm a transactional inside out approach to customer experience management cem which takes an outside in approach to the customer experience by providing the right touch to the right customer at the right time every time
7351020 customer loyalty is one of many topics generating discussion this week in the world of crm centric blogs whats customer loyalty worth many might instinctively respond to that question by saying loyalty is worth quite a lot but is loyalty in and of itself a worthy goal to pursue its awfully difficult to measure and it doesnt necessarily have much bearing on a companys bottom line
7351021 fib number one the crm system comes with 200 standard reports which will meet most of your needs cue the salesperson to point to a long and seemingly exhaustive list of reports on the screen in reality each organisations processes and informational needs are unique and are rarely met by the out of the box standard reports this is exacerbated by the fact that many crm software developers seem to have been rather more rather more focused on developing the long list of standard reports rather than ones that might be useful or insightful

7351039 not particularly bidens not particularly damaging to obama in that its a non event to his base biden is more liberal than obama on economic issues at least as far as voting records go i think obama may actually be the more liberal but his voting record is so scant the datas skewed biden was for the war but hes made up for that in anti war circles with his fights against the intelligence programs we need to protect the country however picking biden will alienate conservatives from obama all the more and is not exciting enough to turn independents
7351040 im not sure what this means exactly if you mean politically savvy then no biden as a senator from delaware brings no pivotal states to obama if you mean look how good my judgment is it shows obama to be careful not particularly new and exciting so its counter to his message but biden rocks few boats if thats what you mean
7351041 no it doesnt further energize the liberal base which could have become even more ecstatic with other choices it doesnt turn off the mainstream dems but neither does it energize them it doesnt do anything for independents who are turned off by washington players and it further frightens and angers the conservatives and delawares electoral votes who cares and he had them anyway
7351042 yes most def the brash young obama ran for president before he even gained an understanding of washingtons inside games biden will bring this understanding to an obama administration and will provide valuable counsel in how to actually get things done a much different task than just standing around looking new and shiny

7351052 you dont put up any more barriers for victims wanting to enter the shelter
7351053 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse

7351055 free hostel for women with emotional problems if they are willing to hate their husbands enough and are willing to take out protective orders against their husbands
7351056 after hours some of these women would sneak men into their rooms the same men who had supposedly abused them
7351057 i on numerous occasions reported illegal drug use that i had witnessed take place on shelter property and often my complaints were ignored
7351058 in 2006 5 886 individuals were turned away from shelters in colorado due to a lack of capacity

7351129 however once it turned out these boats contain too little food and mostly activists some people left the beach disappointed

7351165 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7351166 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7351167 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7351168 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7351169 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7351170 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7351171 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately
7351172 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7351173 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7351174 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future

7351189 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7351190 there was no attempt last night to make us aware of the possible severity of the injury
7351191 obviously nothing had been done yet there was no mri and they could not conduct a full examination once that was conducted then the doctors felt very strongly about this course of action
7351192 it is an extensive injury that takes considerable time to heal i have heard it said four months but again probably each individual is somewhat different the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
7351193 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear
7351194 he was obviously subdued but he assured me that he was okay
7351195 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers and that this is something that dr
7351196 after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure the right way to go i tried to talk to the coaches about it and i assured the coaches that we will have to be at our best because our team will know before they come in here tomorrow because of the media and we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused and our thoughts on going forward
7351197 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon
7351198 and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7351199 the only thing i have talked to michael about is his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7351200 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7351201 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7351202 look continuity is important if youre a betting guy youd say im probably going to do it but its not official

7351207 canadians are one of the biggest talkers in the world
7351208 what im saying is you have to look at the first responders and how its gonna jeopardize their lives
7351209 you have to look at a new ordinance in order to protect firemen and policemen going to the scenes of people who have armed themselves in their home
7351210 im not just going to say oh because the supreme court overturned washingtons handgun ban were just gonna dismiss it and all the sudden people can arm themselves
7351211 in chicago gunfire is a routine feature of the citys dominant criminal dynamic because of a deeply entrenched multi generational gang system with authorities estimate close to 70 000 members citywide
7351212 the regular citizen in chicago cannot go anywhere and buy firearms
7351213 and yet in one year in the 1990s we had more than 19 000 weapons recovered in one year weve been averaging 10 000 weapons recovered every year for the last 10 or 12 or 14 years and thats with a ban
7351214 what does a policeman do when theres a domestic battery call and theyre both armed do they enter the home or apartment or do they wait outside how bout the neighbors how bout the postman all the other issues that go with people coming into your home or close to your home whose responsibility is it when your son takes the gun outside and police come by its just not allowing people to arm themselves how many guns do you have 50 60 can they have a 357 magnum can they have ammunition that will go through a wall
7351215 the mayor should be so lucky in the days of the so called
7351216 he harper seems to not understand that we need to be stimulating those programs we must encourage different arts and culture

7351265 biden and reporters covering his campaign said that in speeches before and after that debate the senator has given kinnock credit for the same passionate rhetoric which he has used repeatedly in recent weeks
7351266 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it
7351267 the new york times reported that during a debate biden had plagiarized a speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock biden had used kinnocks words in speeches before always crediting him but this time he didnt

7351347 well theres this book i read about a little girl she died when she was five but she had all these theories on life she drew three upside down triangles and under the first she wrote 1 under the second she wrote god and under the third one she wrote her name anna she said that all the numbers in the world are contained in the number one that if you just keep adding one that eventually youll reach any number she said that all words and things in existence are contained in god that god is present in all things and that anything and everything exists through god the triangle with her name its a reflection of her life all of her actions good and bad and that the responsibility and weight comes back to her
7351348 well im reading this book right now that talks about relationships and how we tend to seek out people who are strong where we are weak for example id look for someone charming that can swoop in an save me i always end up stuck talking to people and cant figure out how to politely get away

7351373 das war das erste mal dass ich in der schwangerschaft getrunken habe
7351374 wir sa en am hermann ehlers platz haben ber probleme gequatscht nebenbei habe ich den klaren mit o saft getrunken
7351375 ich habe einfach panik bekommen weil der mich so fest angefasst hat den blauen fleck von seinem griff sieht man ja jetzt noch
7351376 die waren ganz sch n sauer auf mich es gab eine standpauke
7351377 blonde haartolle weltgewandt und er war in berlin geboren das war etwas ganz besonderes f r uns
7351378 gewollt es war die einzige m glichkeit von zu hause wegzukommen
7351379 er lie mich hochschwanger allein zog st ndig mit seinen kumpels los
7351380 auf der stra e durften wir uns nicht zusammen blicken lassen
7351381 ich war verzweifelt und hilflos habe ihn trotz allem geliebt
7351382 jeden job hat er geschmissen er hatte einfach keine lust zu arbeiten
7351383 seinen frust lie der feigling immer an den kindern aus er st rzte sich auf sie ich bin dann dazwischen gegangen und habe auch pr gel bekommen
7351384 er suchte immer einen grund um wieder zuhauen zu k nnen
7351385 er hat christiane die lebensregel beigebracht schlagen oder geschlagen werden es ist ihm v llig egal gewesen ob er uns verletzt oder nicht
7351386 ich bin zu hause so erzogen worden man l sst sich nicht scheiden man bleibt zusammen bis der tod einen scheidet und wahrscheinlich war es auch der stolz meinem vater zeigen zu wollen dass ich alleine durchkomme
7351387 ihr vater wollte mich aus dem 11 stock st rzen
7351388 einmal hat er mich im elften stock ins fenster gesetzt wollte mich runterst rzen ich habe mich festgeklammert und nach ihm getreten bis er nicht mehr konnte
7351389 ich bin dann meistens ein paar stunden drau en herumgelaufen um wieder zur ruhe zu kommen
7351390 dann schmiss er mich aus dem schlafzimmer ich musste im zimmer der kinder bernachten das hat ihn alles gar nicht gest rt
7351391 er schlug ich war eingezw ngt in meinem bett und kam nicht raus er hatte noch nie so zugeschlagen und ich dachte er haut mich tot
7351392 das war wohl einer der schrecklichsten momente in meinem leben als meine mutter einfach ohne ein wort zu sagen aus der wohnung ging und uns allein lie
7351393 es hat mir nat rlich leidgetan dass sie so lange alleine waren
7351394 ich bin halt so erzogen dass man arbeitet und versucht seine familie ordentlich zu versorgen
7351395 ich habe gemerkt dass christiane eifers chtig auf ihn war aber das war v llig unbegr ndet die kinder sind nicht zu kurz gekommen
7351396 im gegenteil klaus hat uns sehr viel gutes getan als allererstes hat er eine waschmaschine angeschafft bis dahin habe ich die w sche in der badewanne gewaschen und seine schwester hatte sogar einen kleingarten da durften wir dann unsere wochenenden verbringen
7351397 klar da war pl tzlich jemand da der gesagt hat r ume dein zimmer auf
7351398 ich m chte mich bedanken dass sie so zahlreich zum tag der offenen t r gekommen sind
7351399 joe hat in frankfurt 88 prozent der zweik mpfe gewonnen da haben ich und der rest der mannschaft sich gewundert dass er nicht spielt
7351400 er darf so etwas nicht sagen das war ein fehler ich habe ihm das deutlich gesagt er hat sich bei mir entschuldigt aber er muss sich noch bei der ganzen mannschaft entschuldigen
7351401 das war nicht gegen den trainer gerichtet sondern nur f r joe
7351402 wie ein profi fragen sie ihn selber er hat noch trainingsr ckstand ich habe ihn vorher informiert er hat das gut aufgenommen

7351406 the circumstances of this letter suggest that it merits a particularly low level of deference the views the fda there offers and the significance it there attributes to its prior administrative actions have not been shown to be the product of any agency proceeding were not expressed at the time those actions were taken nor even at the time that fellners damages allegedly arose and are certainly not self evident from the nature of the actions themselves the fda expressed those views only later through a most informal of methods a letter offering a legal theory for the litigation in california most importantly we simply do not find the letters reasoning persuasive for the reasons we set forth below

7351413 the very business model of independent investment banks is coming under fire
7351414 this is a reminder that the days of the standalone investment bank are numbered and that they must increasingly align themselves with universal banks to survive
7351415 investors are unwilling to accept any positive view of the company management is unwilling to sell out at a deeply distressed value
7351416 the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
7351417 management may have more capital than time on its side
7351418 there will be a time to buy lehman shares but that time has not yet arrived
7351419 solvency concerns like trading errors do not age well and we believe that the longer the market frets about lehmans balance sheet exposures the more likely counter parties are to pull back from the firm which could cause lasting damage to its franchise

7351432 even as barack obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections they said president clintons 1993 deficit reduction plan would wreck the economy eight years and 23 million new jobs later the economy proved them wrong

7351510 were eisenhower republicans here we stand for lower deficits free trade and the bond market isnt that great we help the bond market and we hurt the people who voted us in
7351511 the debasement of world currency it is inflation but not as we know it
7351512 i think he has a certain star quality malcolm is one of those people who seems destined for great things
7351513 the kings are in last place in the western conference and they beat us in all three games this year
7351514 weve lost five out of our last six so i dont think our confidence is too high right now
7351515 in situations like this youve just got to make sure you work hard and do things right in practice and itll carry over into the games
7351516 we have to cut out the mistakes were turning pucks over way too many times and giving up quality chances were breaking it down every day on video but i guess weve got to do it even more and pay better attention because its costing us games
7351517 im not thinking too far ahead but yeah it would be nice to win some games and get some more goals too down the stretch
7351518 fifty goals would be great but its a big task
7351519 he sees the ice very well and when we play together we seem to find each other out there
7351520 hes great defensively as well as offensively so its great to have him back
7351521 we just have to be ready and try to win as many games against top teams and teams from our division as possible
7351522 im just going out there to work hard and do my best every night as long as the team wins thats the key
7351523 junior hockey really has the respect from the people in canada
7351524 when you get out of the plane you can smell hockey
7351525 the first night people got to the rink and just walked around with their mouths open
7351526 i was one of them i was in awe of the place
7351527 its an honour to win the conn smythe but id trade it for the stanley cup anytime
7351528 it was nice to see a lot of shots early to get me into it because i was very nervous
7351529 i wasnt even trying to score when i threw it on net
7351530 to us it is a sign of respect that so many other countries see what we are doing and want to put similar programs in place
7351531 its always tough leaving home when youre 16 or 17 years old and living with new people
7351532 but the junior teams find great families you can stay with that helped me a lot
7351533 theyve been really excited every time ive called theyre just happy to talk and go over old stories from when i played up there
7351534 it was the first time theyd hosted a hockey player but they took very good care of me
7351535 they always asked me a lot of questions like about what i wanted to eat and helped me with my laundry and my english my best memory was probably celebrating thanksgiving we dont have thanksgiving in the czech republic so it was something new for me we had a great meal with a big turkey
7351536 i pulled the bag off him just in time and he was breathing hard for probably an hour
7351537 so thats probably the most heroic thing i guess ive done
7351538 the temperature dropped down to 30 below one night and we had a whole work party out on the street with blowtorches working on his car
7351539 the first thing we do is inquire if the existing billets are coming back
7351540 then we know how many more we need to get if necessary we advertise to our existing season ticket base as well as through minor hockey and soccer that were looking for billet families its an ongoing process
7351541 there are more opportunities for people to open up their homes in vancouver like bringing in college students all our players are placed in the suburbs of ladner and tsawwassen and they go to south delta high school theyre all within seven miles of each other
7351542 the off ice network they create for the kids is phenomenal
7351543 hes a top player who plays top minutes but hes not a young guy anymore
7351544 our last couple of games before the break didnt go too well
7351545 we felt we could have had a better effort and better outcome in those games it leaves you with a bit of a bitter taste in your mouth but you have to get over it get some rest and get away from the game mentally and physically to come back on the road i think was a good thing it helped us get back to focusing on the elements of our game that are strong
7351546 we just want to make sure hes close to 100 percent you dont want to rush it other parts of your body can start overcompensating for a hernia and then you start having problems in those other areas if hes ready to go itll be great to get him back along with other guys that have been injured like philippe boucher and sergei zubov
7351547 our power play was in the top five in the league for the first quarter of the season
7351548 we were clicking at about 25 percent a lot of good offensive things were happening its fun when you get a chance to get out there and move the puck around then the penalties crept in and our offense dropped off a bit so it went down to 15 percent for a while you try to create things offensively but we know the backbone of this team is our defense and our checking
7351549 i think it would be a lot of fun to be here in canada where they love hockey when we played canada for the gold medal in salt lake city in 2002 it was a tremendous game its a tough call id love to play at an olympics thats close by so lots of friends and family can attend but thats way down the road and ill be close to 40 then
7351550 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
7351551 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
7351552 if everything tastes like chicken then everything is fowel tasting
7351553 its because of our use of stop and search and points of entry you would expect more arrests because were searching more people

7351610 casi me caigo de la silla observar su esfuerzo con las palabras y la memoria no pod a creerlo ella ten a 75 a os pero siempre pensaba que era una persona que no envejec a sin tiempo y ciento por ciento de hierro
7351611 el contraste se ala fue a n m s sorprendente porque hasta ese momento su memoria era siempre como la web

7351616 obviamente joe y yo hemos estado en diferentes campos filos ficos pero lo considero un buen amigo y un buen hombre
7351617 el apoyo de la senadora para barack obama es claro
7351618 clinton ha dicho repetidas veces que barack obama y ella comparten el compromiso de cambiar el rumbo del pa s de sacar a ee uu de irak y de ampliar el acceso a la asistencia m dica
7351619 es interesante que eso no aparezca en el aviso de los republicanos
7351620 estoy tan contento y feliz especialmente luego del desastre en hungr a

7351627 after receiving and evaluating the mandatory requirements for the joint support ship project from the bidders the crown has determined that the proposals were not compliant with the basic terms of the request for proposals rfp among other compliance failures both bids were significantly over the established budget provisions this project was initiated to replace the protecteur class auxiliary oiler replenishment vessels with three multi role ships to be delivered to the canadian forces between 2012 and 2016
7351628 i think the ferttita brothers have done an amazing job i dont know anyone else who would have gone 40 million in the hole like they did and they had the political clout to pull it off i had partners who wanted to purchase the ufc prior to that but they backed out of the deal weeks before the fertittas took it my reason for leaving was joe silva he was in bed with those guys that was the position he coveted so they didnt need me to do that also the idea of owning all the fighters managerial wise i was totally against
7351629 i would do different job better is a judgement i cant make i come from a different perspective a fighters perspective wallid ismail and i are the only promoters who come from a fighters perspective
7351630 if hes not in the ufc anymore thats the logical thing to do
7351631 if you control the fighters you control the results you dont have to be a mind reader to know what the f im talking about
7351632 i thought those shows were despicable a real immaturity in terms of matchmaking
7351633 similar to mixed martial arts with the addition of a thousand other things which will occur on the field of play youll see my promotional video in the next six months
7351634 im excited a sport i worked so hard on worked so well for the people involved i hope my new sport is received and i make mixed martial arts look like a sandbox game
7351635 it is clear that jesus was a man of color
7351636 i think it is not a coincidence that mr barack obama a christian and a man of mixed black and white blood has risen up to us as he has with such a strong belief that we can come together
7351637 with this opinion he the author b l conway is on dangerous spiritual ground and that has nothing to do with his suggestion of the color of jesus skin of course from the middle east the messiah likely was dark skinned swarthy
7351638 but dear god what darkness of heart and soul deception yes though would bring the messiahs skin color into this presidential election cycle respectfully who but a contemporary political liberal or a racial separatist would care
7351639 i say that because i have belonged to assemblies of christians denominational and non denominational and in the northeast mid atlantic south and midwest in which i have seen brothers and sisters in christ of various skin colors and even accents to their earthly tongues but no one i repeat on one cared
7351640 and thats because we were and remain united to him who is no respecter of persons which means he jesus doesnt care and differentiate because his love extends to all so why pray tell should a so called christian such as conway make such a case
7351641 conway certainly may vote any way he wishes but hed best be very cautious on how he appears to be slanting the word of god for his own and others personal political purposes not that thats not predicted generally in the bible
7351642 it is proposed that section 3 article xi of the constitution of this state be amended to read
7351643 section 3 the general assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public schools open to all children in the state and shall establish organize and support such other public institutions of learning as may be desirable that will provide a high quality education allowing each student to reach his highest potential

7351673 vor den rennen finden oft die pressekonferenzen in der jeweiligen stadt statt aber man wird mit dem shuttle dorthin gebracht sieht vielleicht ein wahrzeichen der stadt und dann geht es zur ck zum flughafen
7351674 es ist ein ph nomen das vermutlich jeder rennsportler kennt ich fliege schon das 20 mal nach london um zu testen oder ein rennen zu fahren aber die stadt selbst habe ich noch nie gesehen genauso wie barcelona
7351675 dieses mal habe ich mir vorgenommen drei tage l nger in london zu bleiben um die stadt endlich einmal kennen zu lernen aber generell kenne ich die flugh fen besser als die gegenden selbst in denen man rennen f hrt
7351676 ich komme zur rennstrecke um meine arbeit zu leisten und am sonntagabend reise ich ab f r sightseeing bleibt da leider keine zeit
7351677 auch zwischen den rennen gibt es oft so viele termine zu erledigen dass ich an meinen freien tagen lieber zu hause abschalte als noch l nger in der gegend zu bleiben in der das rennen stattgefunden hat

7351682 independentemente da situa o ganhando ou perdendo jogando bem ou jogando mal ningu m vai calar a minha boca fizemos 20 minutos desastrosos contra o palmeiras e levamos quatro gols crescemos no segundo tempo e mostramos que temos condi es de melhorar isso s o que eu posso dizer
7351683 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7351684 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7351685 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7351686 it was a pretty well behaved group and smaller than what we would have expected
7351687 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much
7351688 tell them that i missed him every single day and night after that but that i never regretted any of it
7351689 eu acho que as assist ncias no brasil s o pouco valorizadas s quem faz o gol comemorado e eu costumo brincar com a galera que eles precisam dividir o bicho comigo mas de qualquer forma fico feliz por ter conseguido ajudar
7351690 o leandro resgata uma coisa importante que o lateral apoiador com o uso do 3 5 2 e dos laterais como alas as pessoas costumam dizer que eles precisam chegar na rea e definir mas todo mundo esquece que o lateral algu m que deve preparar as jogadas antes de mais nada o leandro faz isso muito bem
7351691 ele um jogador de muita qualidade e tem dado passes importantes fico feliz pela participa o dele e por estarmos aproveitando
7351692 o diego souza n o vinha rendendo tudo o que pode ele um jogador que atua de forma mais contundente e mais perigosa quando est mais perto dos atacantes e cresceu fazendo isso nas ltimas rodadas a participa o dele foi fundamental para fazer essa bola chegar ao nosso campo de ataque
7351693 eu n o posso falar nada porque ainda vou conversar com ele a minha decis o est tomada mas n o posso anunciar para voc s n o quero passar nada para a imprensa antes de ter um encontro com o espinosa
7351694 a situa o muito complicada n s n o queremos voltar segunda divis o montamos um time para n o cair e estamos nos esfor ando para n o cair n o podemos nos conformar com a presen a na zona de rebaixamento

7351733 subrata was a little reserved but was good natured we cant believe that he took such a drastic step
7351734 i would have bought new shirts for all of them he had been after me for some time for the shirt but i did not have the money to make the purchase right away i had tried to tell him that there was still enough time before puja and that all of them would get new shirts
7351735 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
7351736 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
7351737 mexican military personnel crossed over the border and pointed rifles at him
7351738 backup units arrived from the ajo border patrol station and the mexican military personnel eventually returned to mexico
7351739 these documents not only show the dangerous and chaotic situation at the mexican border but also the complicity of some mexican government agents in violating u s law
7351740 the u s government must begin to take these incidents more seriously publicize them and take measures to bring the crisis at our border under control
7351741 fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
7351742 a few years ago the mexican military went a step further and put a 50 calibre rifle round through the rear window of a border patrol agents patrol vehicle south of ajo nothing was ever done nobody was ever held accountable particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers although they were apparently on foot this time
7351743 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
7351744 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
7351745 im surprised the bush administration doesnt arrest and convict the border agents involved like they did agents ignacio ramos and jose compean dont worry soon we wont have borders anyway well be the north american union and will be nothing more than a third world oligarchy just like good ol mexico
7351746 my brother in law a very wise man suggested years ago that we build a half mile wide trench the length of the mexican border with guard towers every 100 yards fill it with all the chemical and nuclear waste we have and then shoot anything that glows in the dark he was right
7351747 troopers attempted to apprehend three vehicles believed to be smuggling contraband on i 10 as the vehicles approached the border troopers stated that a mexican military humvee armed with a 50 caliber weapon and several soldiers were seen assisting smugglers return to mexico officers then noticed several armed subjects dressed in fatigue type clothing unload the contraband into the humvee these subjects set fire to the stalled vehicle before leaving the area
7351748 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god priest antonio rungi of the southern italian diocese of modragone told the daily corriere della sera
7351749 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm he said
7351750 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns notably from africa and latin america
7351751 the love boss you picking up the love of your life
7351752 we were only able to navigate about five of the lakes
7351753 right now were actually able to go through cannon all the way up into hartridge and idlewild
7351754 as far as the lake levels and the fishing it has benefited us
7351755 we told some of our friends in orlando you know send some rain my way
7351756 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
7351757 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
7351758 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
7351759 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
7351760 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
7351761 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
7351762 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
7351763 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
7351764 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
7351765 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
7351766 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
7351767 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
7351768 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
7351769 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
7351770 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
7351771 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
7351772 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
7351773 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
7351774 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
7351775 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
7351776 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
7351777 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
7351778 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
7351779 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
7351780 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
7351781 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
7351782 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
7351783 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
7351784 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
7351785 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
7351786 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
7351787 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
7351788 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
7351789 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
7351790 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
7351791 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
7351792 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
7351793 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
7351794 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
7351795 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
7351796 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
7351797 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
7351798 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
7351799 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
7351800 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
7351801 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
7351802 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
7351803 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
7351804 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
7351805 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
7351806 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
7351807 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
7351808 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
7351809 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
7351810 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
7351811 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
7351812 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
7351813 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
7351814 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
7351815 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
7351816 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
7351817 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
7351818 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
7351819 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
7351820 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
7351821 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
7351822 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
7351823 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
7351824 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
7351825 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
7351826 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
7351827 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
7351828 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
7351829 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
7351830 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
7351831 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
7351832 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
7351833 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
7351834 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
7351835 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
7351836 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
7351837 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
7351838 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
7351839 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
7351840 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
7351841 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
7351842 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
7351843 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
7351844 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
7351845 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
7351846 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
7351847 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
7351848 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
7351849 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
7351850 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
7351851 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
7351852 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
7351853 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
7351854 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
7351855 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
7351856 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
7351857 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
7351858 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
7351859 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
7351860 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
7351861 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
7351862 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
7351863 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
7351864 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
7351865 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
7351866 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
7351867 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
7351868 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
7351869 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
7351870 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
7351871 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
7351872 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
7351873 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
7351874 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
7351875 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
7351876 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
7351877 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
7351878 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
7351879 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
7351880 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
7351881 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
7351882 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
7351883 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
7351884 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
7351885 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
7351886 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
7351887 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
7351888 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
7351889 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
7351890 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
7351891 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
7351892 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
7351893 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
7351894 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
7351895 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
7351896 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
7351897 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
7351898 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
7351899 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
7351900 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
7351901 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
7351902 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
7351903 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
7351904 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
7351905 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
7351906 what would happen if a pretty non catholic stigmatic a lutheran pastor an axe murderess a sexist hiker whos allergic to ketchup an untalented folk singing former camp counselor her bitter british friend an old guy who wants to borrow an axe a nice dessert bearing lutheran couple and a forest ranger trainee were thrown together one cold and rainy october night in northeastern pennsylvania
7351907 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
7351908 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
7351909 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history

7351911 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
7351912 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
7351913 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
7351914 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
7351915 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
7351916 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
7351917 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
7351918 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides

7351927 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
7351928 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
7351929 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
7351930 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
7351931 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
7351932 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
7351933 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
7351934 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
7351935 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
7351936 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
7351937 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
7351938 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
7351939 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
7351940 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
7351941 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
7351942 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
7351943 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
7351944 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
7351945 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
7351946 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
7351947 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
7351948 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
7351949 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
7351950 the very business model of independent investment banks is coming under fire
7351951 this is a reminder that the days of the standalone investment bank are numbered and that they must increasingly align themselves with universal banks to survive
7351952 investors are unwilling to accept any positive view of the company management is unwilling to sell out at a deeply distressed value
7351953 the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
7351954 management may have more capital than time on its side
7351955 there will be a time to buy lehman shares but that time has not yet arrived
7351956 solvency concerns like trading errors do not age well and we believe that the longer the market frets about lehmans balance sheet exposures the more likely counter parties are to pull back from the firm which could cause lasting damage to its franchise
7351957 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
7351958 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
7351959 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
7351960 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
7351961 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
7351962 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
7351963 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
7351964 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
7351965 our study sheds new light on how that process works
7351966 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
7351967 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
7351968 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
7351969 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
7351970 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
7351971 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
7351972 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
7351973 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
7351974 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
7351975 so if you make 3 million youre middle class if you make 1 million you need food stamps
7351976 our business is to accept nothing which contradicts our basic experience merely because it comes to us from tradition or convention or authority it may well be that we shall be wrong but our self expression in thwarted at the root unless the certainties we are asked to accept coincide with the certainties we experience that is why the condition of freedom in any state is always a widespread and consistent skepticism of the canons upon which power insists
7351977 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
7351978 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
7351979 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
7351980 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
7351981 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
7351982 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
7351983 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
7351984 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
7351985 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
7351986 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
7351987 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
7351988 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
7351989 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
7351990 we will do whatever we can to save these children
7351991 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
7351992 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
7351993 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
7351994 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
7351995 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
7351996 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
7351997 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
7351998 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
7351999 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
7352000 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
7352001 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
7352002 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
7352003 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
7352004 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
7352005 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
7352006 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
7352007 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
7352008 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
7352009 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart

7352036 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
7352037 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
7352038 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
7352039 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
7352040 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
7352041 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
7352042 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
7352043 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
7352044 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
7352045 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
7352046 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
7352047 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
7352048 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
7352049 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
7352050 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
7352051 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
7352052 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
7352053 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
7352054 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
7352055 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
7352056 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
7352057 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
7352058 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
7352059 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
7352060 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
7352061 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
7352062 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
7352063 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
7352064 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
7352065 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
7352066 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
7352067 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
7352068 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
7352069 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
7352070 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
7352071 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
7352072 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
7352073 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
7352074 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
7352075 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
7352076 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
7352077 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
7352078 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
7352079 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
7352080 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
7352081 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
7352082 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
7352083 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
7352084 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
7352085 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
7352086 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
7352087 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
7352088 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
7352089 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
7352090 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
7352091 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
7352092 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
7352093 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
7352094 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
7352095 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
7352096 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
7352097 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
7352098 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
7352099 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
7352100 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
7352101 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
7352102 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
7352103 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
7352104 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
7352105 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
7352106 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
7352107 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
7352108 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
7352109 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
7352110 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
7352111 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
7352112 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
7352113 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
7352114 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
7352115 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
7352116 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases
7352117 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
7352118 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
7352119 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
7352120 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope

7352125 was neither armed nor resisted apprehension nor posed a threat to perez
7352126 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
7352127 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
7352128 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
7352129 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
7352130 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
7352131 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
7352132 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
7352133 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
7352134 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
7352135 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
7352136 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
7352137 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
7352138 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
7352139 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
7352140 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
7352141 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
7352142 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude

7352147 i dropped by the map a institute of technology one day
7352148 among the designs of residential houses which i have picked out is this one by dominiciano l calaguas that of a one story house a chalet pronounced tsa let in the philippines as it is popularly known with a ground floor which may be utilized for the laundry room and servants quarters
7352149 let us see how the plan works after all that is the best test for the livability of a house
7352150 the entry porch is tiled and cool with the shadows of the eaves eaves which are alive with the drama of hand carved rafters now we step into the living room dignified in size yet familiar and almost too intimate
7352151 the open terrace is visible through tall french windows the terrace is open and is tiled and is so handy for late afternoon teas and for quiet communion with the stars t he dining room also connects to the terrace
7352152 we go next to the kitchen a small compact affair where the wife may go about her cooking with pleasure for convenience everything is within reach ventilation is two way and ample the floor is tiled and walls are wainscoted
7352153 this house may be constructed with a combination of different groups of lumber ipil for posts tanguili for flooring and walls apitong for roof framing the ground wall may be of adobe stones or bricks the windows of frosted glass and the roof of corrugated galvanized iron sheets complete this may cost p4 900 or thereabouts

7352179 youre feedback is that youre making great progress but your feedback is also you have a lot of work to do
7352180 i hoped to have a lot of those things announced by now but i dont were committed to it youre not hearing me say were not but its taking quite a bit longer than id hoped to have all of the services available to our partners i certainly hope by the end of the year i will have accomplished that
7352181 there is a lot more work we can do to do a better job at communicating our value add and in assuring that you and all of our partners understand what were doing and what were investing in
7352182 this shows that microsoft really gets virtualisation and is working to make the licensing friendly to their customers
7352183 this change means that clients can move virtual software images from server to server without any negative licensing repercussions
7352184 this makes sense because the licensing will now allow organisations to failover their virtual sessions back and forth as necessary
7352185 the old way of only allowing an organization to failover every 90 days just didnt make sense at all when you failover you failover
7352186 now customers wont be restricted from utilising vmwares vmotion or the livemigrate functionality from xenserver and virtual iron
7352187 i think weve all known that as soon as hyper v was available that microsoft would magically support virtualising these servers and services
7352188 i find it ironic that in order to out hip apple microsoft is hiring a comedian whose prime was a decade ago they may as well have phil collins do the background music while theyre at it
7352189 i think seinfeld was credible in the american express ads he used to do but microsoft needs him to be twice as good at comedy and many more times effective at drawing the audience into the message of the commercials if they want to best apple
7352190 gates is certainly a very recognizable figure but hes never been someone i viewed in the position of a humorous or edgy pitchman for microsoft
7352191 whenever ive seen him speak about microsoft and its products it has always been a much more logical intellectual presentation and im wondering how that fits in this new series
7352192 if the entertainment value of their ads isnt exceptional theyll look like a cornered cat lashing aimlessly in desperation
7352193 what made the apple ads funny were the exaggerated elements of truth while microsoft has fixed much of what apple creatively made fun of microsoft cant just debunk the prior ads instead they need to come over the top and try to get apple on the defense but with class
7352194 polanski did not perceive having intercourse with a 13 year old girl as against the law that was not in his culture you know it was a so what type of thing

7352199 michigan had the guts to take the system on and we made progress this year
7352200 you see the candidates coming to michigan talking about the issues talking about manufacturing and we think we need a nominating process that gives every state that chance to talk about the issues

7352215 china opened itself to the world community to an extent that would have been unimaginable at the time of the east west division of germany

7352219 the us government encourages the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and olympic games
7352220 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7352221 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics

7352223 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
7352224 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
7352225 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
7352226 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
7352227 acting in a way likely to be publicly embarrassing to the debtor

7352239 le corone sono di origine antica e i buddisti furono probabilmente i primi a farne uso sia buddisti che musulmani le usano nelle preghiere
7352240 egli sar grande e sar chiamato figlio dellaltissimo il signore dio dar a lui il trono di davide suo padre il suo regno non avr fine
7352241 la preghiera dovrebbe essere unespressione dellamicizia che si ha con dio
7352242 non trovavo nulla di istruttivo nella recita del rosario avrei preferito leggere libri religiosi

7352270 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
7352271 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
7352272 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
7352273 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
7352274 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly and defense are working
7352275 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic

7352353 por supuesto que creemos que los nuevos valores que tenemos que construir como sociedad los tenemos que hacer varones y mujeres juntos coment la tana del fpds nosotras creemos que estamos ante un desaf o muy grande que es romper con todos los estereotipos que nos asignaron como mujeres creemos que dado el contexto econ mico pol tico y social que est atravesando am rica latina los movimientos sociales tenemos que encarar una instancia de unidad y de lucha con una agenda com n que nos incluya en toda am rica latina
7352354 pero la lucha de las mujeres empez en la d cada del 80 en el sur de brasil
7352355 es una lucha de salir de la casa y entender que el lugar de la mujer tambi n es en la calle
7352356 estamos en un momento muy dif cil en la lucha de las mujeres en brasil a partir de la formaci n que hacemos se sumaron m s mujeres es importante fortalecer la lucha en defensa de la vida para nosotras la lucha desde adentro espec fica de las mujeres contra la violencia de clase expresada en el machismo que legitima la dominaci n del hombre por sobre la mujer es muy importante participar de la lucha de las mujeres sean feministas o no es importante que se re nan porque nosotras debemos ir ayud ndolas cotidianamente

7352359 dont take this gt gt the gt gt wrong way but
7352360 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7352361 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7352362 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7352363 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7352364 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7352365 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7352366 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7352367 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7352368 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7352369 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7352370 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7352371 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7352372 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7352373 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7352374 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7352375 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7352421 huu ni uonevu dhahir uliofanywa na nyerere jamal na mtei kwa kuchochewa kuongozwa na kudhibitiwa na watawala wakoloni mamboleo
7352422 suala la iwapo zanzibar inastahiki kuwakilishwa pekee katika bodi ni muhimu sana na nitashukuru nikipata ushauri wako kama kutakuwa na mwakilishi kutoka zanzibar katika mkutano ujao
7352423 punde hivi nimemuandikia hinchey kwamba isipokuwa kama kuna kauli madhubuti kutoka dar es salaam inayothibitisha kuhudhuria kwa zanzibar na tusiwe sisi tunaozua suala hilo haitokuwa sawa kwa bodi kumualika mwakilishi kutoka zanzibar kwa sasa kusema kweli italeta fadhaa embarrassment kuona wale wenye nia ya kujitenga huko visiwani wanapewa kichwa
7352424 nimeagizwa kutamka kwamba kwa mujibu wa katiba ya muda inayoongoza muungano baina ya tanganyika na zanzibar katika vikao vya siku za mbele vya bodi utaendelea kwa utaratibu ule ule kama ilivyokuwa kabla ya muungano makubaliano ya muungano baina ya tanganyika na zanzibar hayahamishi moja kwa moja does not specifically transfer mambo ya sarafu kuingia katika serikali ya muungano na mpaka yatakapofanywa mabadiliko kama itakavyokubaliwa uanachama wa bodi ya sarafu unabaki kama ulivyo
7352425 tunaweka wazi kwamba hatuitaki zanzibar katika kikao chetu kinachofuata na natumai njia zinaweza kupatikana kuwaweka nje lile ambalo ningependa kufanya kwa sasa ni kukumbusha juu ya suala hili ili kuhakikisha kwamba hakuna makabrasha yanayovuka bahari hadi tutapokuwa na uhakika wa msimamo wetu
7352426 nakala moja zaidi ya kila waraka badala ya kuzipeleka moja kwa moja zanzibar kama ilivyokuwa utaratibu huko nyuma
7352427 tunachukulia kwamba utahudhuria kikao kama mjumbe wa bodi kwa jamhuri ya muungano lakini bila ya shaka utapenda kufikiria kama nakala za ziada zinafaa zipelekwe zanzibar kwa taarifa
7352428 ofisi ya tanzania ya bodi ya sarafu ya afrika mashariki
7352429 mabadiliko haya ya jina la ofisi huenda yakaleta sura kwamba ni dhamana kwa sarafu zanzibar na kwa hiyo sina hakika kama ni vyema kubadilishwa
7352430 kiasi nijuavyo mimi nchi zinazounda tanzania zingali zinaitwa tanganyika na zanzibar
7352431 inaonesha hakuna wasiwasi kwa hivyo kwamba ofisi yako iendelee kuonekana kama ofisi ya tanganyika
7352432 niliwekewa wazi huko nyuma na mtei kwamba kikao kamili cha bodi kitaleta fadhaa embarrassing kwa hivi sasa kwa vile haitowezekana kuepuka kuwepo kwa mwakilishi wa zanzibar
7352433 utamke kwa maneno yako mwenyewe spell out in your own words nini ungependa kisemwe rasimu inaweza baadae labda baada ya kuiona mimi kuoneshwa wakili
7352434 kwa maoni yangu hili ni suala ambalo ingekuwa vyema pengine kutotumia mawakili wa e a c s o jumuiya ya ushirikiano ya afrika mashariki au pengine hata wakili mwengine yeyote wa kiserikali
7352435 kama mtakavyoona katika rasimu ya muda ambayo nimejaribu kuifanya lazima tuitaje serikali ya zanzibar kama serikali ya kabla ya muungano na serikali ya mkoa ya zanzibar msisitizo ni wetu au maneno yoyote muwafaka kwa maana ya serikali ya baada ya muungano
7352436 huenda kukawa na ulazima nafikiria kutaja serikali ya zanzibar iliyopita na ya sasa au ya baadae badala ya kutaja serikali ya mkoa
7352437 lakini tutashukuru sana iwapo utaonesha kwamba wewe unatosha kusaini kwenye karatasi rasmi ya barua ya tanzania a tanzanian headed letter barua inayofuata rasmi iliyoambatanishwa hapa
7352438 inatilisha wasiwasi kwamba makubaliano ya namna hiyo yanaweza kufanywa bila mabadiliko makubwa katika hadhi status ya kisheria ya eacb yenyewe ni jambo la kutiliwa mashaka au sadiki ukipenda dubious iwapo barua ya katibu mkuu inatosha kujenga uwajibikaji wa kisheria
7352439 kwa sababu zisizojulikana wameingiza maneno yanayotaja kifungu cha xi pia hiki kinahusu bandari usafiri wa anga posta na simu jambo ambalo ni wazi halihusu hapo kinapaswa kutolewa
7352440 uanachama wa hivi sasa uliwekwa na waziri secretary of state wa uingereza lakini ukaendelezwa baada ya uhuru kwa kuhamisha madaraka ya waziri kuhusiana na bodi kwa serikali zinazoshiriki katika bodi zikiamua kwa kauli moja kusema kweli basi lazima serikali zote zinazounda bodi hii ziidhinishe mabadiliko haya
7352441 bodi inadhani taarifa ya waziri wa fedha wa tanzania inakubalika

7352830 maar ook dat advies van academica is onafhankelijk ze bieden hypotheken en verzekeringen aan van aanbieder a b c en d en de oordelen over die partijen zijn transparant
7352831 a christian with a deep faith im rooted in the christian tradition i believe that there are many paths to the same place and that is a belief that there is a higher power a belief that we are connected as a people
7352832 atheists speaking at an interfaith service does that work i dont quite know but theyre part of the party you treat them with respect
7352833 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this interfaith gathering is proof of that
7352834 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vice presidential candidate

7352845 this will underpin the rio share price and also create uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7352846 even if chinalco doesnt increase its stake it shows they have the capacity to block the deal
7352847 it could do a soft deal with bhp and vote for the merger in return for securing the assets
7352848 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7352849 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7352850 you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention than they get
7352851 not just the plasticised beauty you see on television there is also such a thing as a chaste ideal which comes from the heart and the soul and has a beneficial effect on those who come into contact with it
7352852 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelising spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvellous tool for spreading the christian message unfortunately some people still have a closed mentality

7352875 nel sud alcune scuole abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana in sicilia puglia calabria e basilicata organizzeremo corsi intensivi per gli insegnanti
7352876 la scuola deve alzare la propria qualit abbassata dalle scuole del sud
7352877 non ho mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana chi riporta il mio pensiero in questo modo in grave malafede e vuole creare una polemica che chi conosce il mio pensiero sa che non ha fondamento ho sempre ritenuto che esistono bravi professori sia al nord che al sud ma per un attimo ieri sera avevamo avuto qualche dubbio ma il sud oggi ha un deficit strutturale e di progettualit che non certo imputabile al corpo docente

7352916 i was suddenly overwhelmed he recounted with the realization that i loved all people that they were mine and i theirs that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers it was like waking from a dream of separateness of spurious self isolation in a special world the world of renunciation and supposed holiness it is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race though it is a race dedicated to many absurdities and one which makes mistakes yet with all that god himself gloried in becoming a member of the human race to think that such a commonplace realization should suddenly seem like news that one holds the winning ticket in a cosmic sweepstake

7352957 russell evans says 70 000 planetshakers albums are sold in australia each year with 12 albums released so far
7352958 i think its a little wierd that they would just
7352959 should planetshakers learn to focus all credit on jesus rather than individuals particularly given the flawed nature of humans which has never been more evident at planetshakers than in the michael guglielmucci cancer fraud
7352960 i think its a little wierd that they would just
7352961 the question is should anyones name be there better to keep the focus on jesus rather than the earthen vessels he uses
7352962 these churches do not understand grace the organization the brand and the revenue stream are always bigger and more important than the individual
7352963 some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from goodwill the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice
7352964 i say that with the utmost respect to the holy spirit
7352965 i am appalled disgusted angry is this how they solve issues shouldnt this be the time where planet shakers exercise what they preach since theyve been preaching about jesus forgiveness love grace etc theres no better time for them to even put them into practice

7352969 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement
7352970 adkisson targeted the church still wrote in the document obtained by wbir tv channel 10 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
7352971 adkisson told still that he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office

7352983 these higher income students may also have less pressure to work part time to supplement family incomes
7352984 the academic and current lee kuan yew scholar perry lim 36 grew up in a two room flat supported by his fathers earnings as a taxi driver
7352985 now youre not only judged on grades but your accomplishments in ccas and voluntary work as well
7352986 schools should continue to give more support to these kids in their ccas and encourage them to do social or voluntary work
7352987 to what is happening in the world and in business
7352988 such students are also more comfortable dealing with specifically senior level people all this translates to a better interview performance and also better overall maturity when dealing with scholarship boards
7352989 many scholarship givers do give back to society via other ways like outright donations foundations and other csr activities
7352990 in view of the fast expanding income gap it will be an excellent way to level up
7352991 able students from poor households have done well in their studies risen in life and now have children of their own who also tend to do well
7352992 today anwar becomes premier tomorrow israel opens an embassy in kuala lumpur and the day after the americans open an airbase in butterworth
7352993 conspiracy theorists here believe that singapore and america are zionists
7352994 perhaps the images are designed to scare the voters after all anwar has been accused of being a supporter of israel
7352995 thats the problem now there are a lot of accusations floating around
7352996 people from both sides are trying to do harm to this election
7352997 we do not believe the dap will resort to such methods because we are after the same goals that is to get a positive change for our country
7352998 wanted the police to investigate their actions which were in conflict with election guidelines
7352999 i dont see why a public holiday has to be declared on tuesday as the by election is for permatang pauh only and does not involve all of penang
7353000 if the turnout is good we are confident he can get what wan azizah got or even better at least a 15 000 majority
7353001 we are playing catch up now because we have lost this game but we have to bounce back in the next game on wednesday
7353002 we need a top class performance then because today was simply not good enough its a disappointment
7353003 fulham started stronger than us and they were sharper especially in the first half they didnt create many chances if you look at the whole game but they took advantage from a corner
7353004 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7353005 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7353006 basically i take five days to learn and acquire a particular skill be it food wine or spirit at the end of it i go head to head with trained professionals who specialise in that skill
7353007 sometimes i come in first sometimes i come in dead last along the way i take a licking and do my best to keep on ticking
7353008 my favourite hat to wear is one of being a generalist at first i was frustrated at being one and not succeeding in any one field but now i have created a world for myself where being a generalist is my strength i am lucky that people are now particularly interested in food and wine which is what i have been learning about for the last 20 years
7353009 we think a lot of that production is starting to go back up again
7353010 the rapid building of energy infrastructure means they are going to need a lot more coal to fill that actual demand
7353011 when i came to singapore in 1991 there were no more than 20 000 indian expatriates now i think there are about 200 000 professional indians working here
7353012 more indian students want to study different subjects and this is a sign that students are becoming more cosmopolitan
7353013 we never wait for a waiting list to build up we are always working ahead to meet the education needs of expatriates
7353014 i think schools have to look at larger campuses so that they dont have to expand every two years
7353015 and i think we have to proactively build the campus ahead by anticipating demands
7353016 dos tercios de bolivia le han dicho al presidente contin e la transformaci n del pa s para la refundaci n de la rep blica es necesario una nueva constituci n que ya fue aprobada y debe ahora ser refrendada por el pueblo para que le diga s o no eso es democr tico

7353018 the player didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him

7353023 lets put it this way petes sleeping a little better than he was about five months ago
7353024 hes thinking maybe i actually have a chance to hold on to this thing its not out of the question that 14 is going to be enough
7353025 what roger federer was doing winning two sometimes three grand slams a year was unsustainable what he was doing was super human
7353026 i think hes probably a little irritated that people are trying to write him off so quickly

7353028 i havent had time to practise whatsoever since february i can maybe blame myself for not taking time off
7353029 the constructive feedback and suggestions from market participants during the consultation exercise has helped us fine tune the rules to meet market needs these listing rule changes will not only improve market efficiency and shorten trading halts it will also add clarity and promote accountability of listed companies
7353030 i dont think about being the team backing only me from now on
7353031 i always go all out to beat everyone and also my team mate but from now on till the end of the season its all about consistency if we want to win the championship we have to make sure that we stop making mistakes
7353032 we have been phenomenally consistent all season and i have a great team i am sure that we will be fighting all the way to the end
7353033 no matter what prompted it this is the worst possible time to make an announcement like this
7353034 whether or not a mistake has been made there is a lot of time
7353035 they should come back to singapore first have a private talk and not make it look so publicly ugly
7353036 what will people think about our sports officials this is not very nice and can be very embarrassing for those affected
7353037 maybe the decision was made before the olympics but the silver medal complicatesmatters
7353038 i think she is doing what she thinks is best for theassociation when she thinks she is right she will do it

7353040 we have said from the beginning that the opposition pact is actually fragile while it tries to topple the barisan nasional bn it is just an electoral pact and not a solid enough pact to be an alternative to bn
7353041 im not sacking anybody his contract expires on aug 31 and before the beijing olympics ssc had discussed facilitating his return and i said i had no objection it has nothing to do with the gao ning incident
7353042 antonys secondment is until aug 31 and the agreement with stta was that he would return to ssc after that
7353043 i will be reviewing the future of the coaches and the team manager if their objectives are in line with what we intend to do and they can still contribute we will welcome them
7353044 if theyre heading in a different direction then maybe its better for us to look for someone who can head in the same direction
7353045 i have a new team and will have a new ceo and technical director it is best that the manager is chosen by them antony is welcome to apply for the position when we ask for applications
7353046 i didnt say that antony and the coach will be sacked
7353047 i feel that its all been blown out of proportion and now the damage is really terrible
7353048 i dont want to be entangled in this whole issue we have to move on to the bigger picture that stta is working towards
7353049 i really dont know and i cant speculate on the latest development i have not gotten anything in black and white

7353051 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the 2010 elections as the nld does not recognise the military backed constitution

7353068 god is sufficient for us he will give us of his largesse as will his apostle we supplicate no one but god

7353081 there is still one more leg and we know tampines will go all out for that one
7353082 were an attacking team anyway and for us attack is truly the best form of defence
7353083 we created several chances in the first half but failed to score
7353084 but now with home advantage we will have to go on the attack from the first minute and the boys have to put in at least 110 per cent into the game i am confident the boys can overturn the deficit
7353085 although the bernanke fed has but a short track record its too often panicky and exaggerated reactions and actions since august 2007 suggest that it also may have a distorted and exaggerated view of the importance of the financial sector for macro economic stability
7353086 starting sooner rather than later the fed needs to raise the federal funds rate target now slowly and predictably to restore confidence in its continued commitment to price stability which will also provide the necessary stability to the us dollar
7353087 i wish buiter had actually read some of the literature on optimal monetary policy
7353088 you have to give credit to a guy who comes here with black bears on the outside and the federal open market committee on the inside
7353089 one has to see in which universe the various central banks are placed for us things are very very clear we have one needle in our compass we dont have to make any arbitrage between various goals we have a goal which is to deliver price stability in the medium term
7353090 they are not necessarily scared of me but they let me know they are scared of dexter
7353091 you know dexter does terrible things but you also know he works by this code of ethics that requires him to only kill people who are killers themselves and are undeniably reprehensible
7353092 it lets the audience off the hook in feeling bad with the voiceover you feel youre in on the secret with dexter so youre implicated and youre injected with a sense of moral ambiguity dexter takes responsibility for his dark side and uses it for good in some way everybody has a shadow side we all have our secrets and they are very powerful
7353093 to be honest i should be thankful but im a little bummed out i havent received any scary mail
7353094 when the show first came out people would come up to me and say they watched it and keep up the good work
7353095 they almost felt guilty for identifying with the character and would say how they first thought the idea was repulsive but found themselves enjoying the show
7353096 im not inclined to the compulsive behaviours that dexter is inclined to thankfully but i know what its like to be compulsive in other ways
7353097 i play with my watch a lot as you can obviously see
7353098 the apartment is cold and sterile and can be a little creepy lets just say i dont hang out here on the weekends

7353139 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget
7353140 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies

7353143 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7353144 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector

7353236 as the real campaign at last begins in denver this week this much is certain its time for barack obama to dispatch change we can believe in to a dignified death this isnt because omg obamas narrow three to four percentage point lead of recent weeks dropped to a statistically indistinguishable one to three point margin during his week of vacation its because zero hour is here as the presidential race finally gains the countrys full attention the strategy that vanquished hillary clinton must be rebooted to take out john mccain

7353270 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7353271 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7353272 it is very important that the government can assure the people that it is able and willing to protect and defend its citizenry
7353273 we have expected them to resist because we are already in our objectives we can probably say we are successfully engaging them therefore there is no failure of intelligence we are heavily engaged in almost all pursuits if there are no engagements it means we are hitting air
7353274 milf guerrillas have put up a fierce resistance from the government troops that were moving inch by inch forward to the camp
7353275 since saturday morning heavy firefight ensued between government troops and lawless milf groups supportive to the group of katos 105th base command sporadic firefight still ongoing as of this time
7353276 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7353277 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7353278 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7353279 we are really concerned about the situation of civilians here in mindanao
7353280 if our laws will not respect the natural law and gods precept then it does not merit any obedience at all
7353281 authority must enact just laws that is laws that correspond to the dignity of the human person and to what is required by right reason
7353282 human law is law insofar as it corresponds to right reason and therefore is derived from the eternal law
7353283 when however a law is contrary to reason it is called an unjust law in such case it ceases to be law and becomes instead an act of violence
7353284 this deped program is in step with president arroyos vision for national unity through education and is implemented under the leadership of secretary jesli lapus
7353285 apart from regular salaries als mobile teachers receive allowances for transportation costs and necessary teaching aids
7353286 classes under the als mobile teacher program are sometimes held in chapels and barangay halls or in the homes of the beneficiaries depending on the resources available to the community
7353287 they understand that it might be difficult for the philippine team to go to the us due to the operations in mindanao so we will have it here at camp aguinaldo on sept 26
7353288 there are protocols we have to look at other activities actually our activities scheduled for june were already pushed back as well as those planned for august and september we have a lineup of activities that needs to be submitted to the council of foreign ministers
7353289 any sane person is bound to go crazy when subjected to incessant physical and verbal abuse by an oppressive employer
7353290 foreign employers may opt to hire other applicants than pay additional medical fees
7353291 there is an ever growing demand for experienced welders with good pay scales
7353292 we need to be attuned to these market realities so we could train our people and leave the more vulnerable occupations behind
7353293 as an officer of the court an attorney is subject to the disciplinary authority of the court and to its orders and directives with respect to his relation to the court as well as to his client
7353294 he is continually accountable to the court for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been granted him
7353295 whenever it is made to appear to the supreme court that an attorney is no longer worthy of the trust and confidence of the people it becomes not only the right but the duty of the court which made him one of its officers and gave him the privilege of ministering within its bar to withdraw the privilege
7353296 at this point he justice sabio then tried to convince me of the rightness of the stand of the gsis and the sec
7353297 i then told him that i will vote according to my conscience and that the most i can do is to have the issuance of the tro and the injunctive relief scheduled for oral arguments
7353298 i also told him that during said hearing respondents must be able to convince me that the tro did not have a legal basis
7353299 for his judicial interference atty camilo sabio must be investigated and if found to have been liable under our ethics he must be perpetually disbarred from the rolls of attorney and from the practice of law

7353302 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
7353303 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts

7353305 entweder ihr macht platz oder dein kopf landet in seinem arsch
7353306 seid ihr sicher dass ihr durch diese t r gehen wollt
7353307 hast du den kopf eines mannes in den hintern eines anderen mannes gesteckt
7353308 no the american newspaper isnt dead its just really re
7353309 come krag you must have some sense of the importance of our quest
7353310 ananse look at who is on this quest of yours
7353311 the fiercest warriors from every race that walks nerthusa and joined by a servant of the spirits and a sage not more than a year ago enemies it is nigh unbelievable
7353312 your biggest fault as a leader my prince always seeing things how you want them to be and not as they are
7353313 enough enough krag your point is made your one fault as a leader always thinking of things in the worst possible way
7353314 regardless of what the other rulers may have thought of this quest we will live forever in an epic there are many legends of the lands to the north and even sparse records of those that have actually traveled there in the height of the second age we have looked inward for far too long two generations of hatred and then another of war memories are like all things on the earth they are worn away by time we must venture forth and make the legends real we must reopen our links with our brothers to the north we must break the monopoly that the torgwhazi have on the nadassana
7353315 ahh the real reason for you and your fathers interest in this quest more coin for the empire of anatolia
7353316 be cyncical it is your way but remember we will always live in the tales they will tell of us
7353317 or only the mountain vultures will remember us as their greatest feast in four generations
7353318 we will head northwest out of sight of land and then back northeast to bypass the city krag and gaethan will head on foot into the city in the evening to buy all that we need
7353319 all of us would be too likely to draw attention unwanted attention in a quest like ours with the resources at our disposal these two are the least likely to beg inquiry and are more than capable of carrying a fair amount in packs emptied expressly for that purpose
7353320 it is indeed unnerving to have a human rouse me without simultaneously feeling a blade worm its way between my ribs
7353321 i spent several years with my mothers tribe the haisan they range near faros fountain and often have contact with the elves of the southern reaches of samanta they are also friendly towards the faro jahedin and aeslanders with whom they have a treaty to allow traffic to pass unmolested on the spirit trail there i learned to track to ride a horse and to hunt both the plains and woods the zansikor are vicious in war especially with their own kind but are also a just and generous people they love the earth as an elf or jahedin does and are a people worthy of emulation
7353322 amaris you can never be sure and as i mentioned there was a man in loraxs larder who took a particularly keen interest in my purchase
7353323 well he stood perhaps a half a hand shorter than myself with a wiry build his mustache was very full and grown such that it came down almost to his jawline on the sides he had bright garish clothes on
7353324 it was an orange three cornered hat with a black crow feather in it
7353325 that feather was not a crow feather but a raven feather and the man who saw you was verrapan if we stay here the night we will be dead by morning
7353326 you two will have the first watch no more than two sands then talus and i the second before we depart
7353327 do you not know a shapechanger when you see one
7353328 you keep a good watch and are very silent for a human
7353329 may the spirits be with you and your companions then until another time
7353330 i dont believe youre from around here if you dont mind me asking where are you from
7353331 you will meet them soon enough come let us go
7353332 un nock your arrow shild it is us returning with krag
7353333 companions this is our last round of introductions this is krag formerly captain of the royal guard of the king of kana and then general of the southern army of the alliance
7353334 above who you did not see was shild of samanta
7353335 yes the leader of the tawhiri raiders i know him
7353336 is that anyway to greet an old friend you rogue
7353337 a thousand pardons you scoundrel it has been a long time
7353338 krag there are provisions for you in that pack there as well as bedding now rest everyone we leave before daybreak
7353339 you heard her everyone go ahead and bed down krag youll take the next shift for guard
7353340 ah a strong group swift of mind as well as body you have chosen well to spare me
7353341 i will ask one more time where is the elf
7353342 show yourself son of samanta or your companion will breathe her last in this glade
7353343 i see you know of him and likely know his reputation for love solely of his own kind also know this we are no brotherhood but a band of convenience this woman you threaten means nothing to him
7353344 perhaps but then she is of no value to me be she dead or alive so why not kill her
7353345 one should be careful of the enemies one makes even a man of such repute as your own this is a sage you hold beneath your blade
7353346 pack your things and load the canoes before the remnants of verappans band or the evil spirit return
7353347 shadestalker is no evil spirit she is a shapechanger and i am fairly confident she means us no harm
7353348 did you have to start a fight with three of them
7353349 oh dont worry theres more inside that will be coming shortly
7353350 when you turn your head to talk to your companion there the tattoo shows and he is missing his wedding finger although he tries to hide it with the gloves
7353351 we have heard of your prowess on the battlefield especially at kaenos bay some months ago equally important to us are your mountaineering and woodsman skills that you acquired as a youth in the arahko
7353352 sounds like you know quite a bit about me but whatever it is im not interested im not a soldier anymore and i dont want to guide anyone
7353353 quiet we are headed north to cross the vandhorn mountains king alarac recently sent an expedition northwards that like many others before it failed to return unlike the others hope was given that a route through the mountains did indeed exist a mule returned laden with jewels medicinal herbs and minerals and paintings of a strange people we heard of these tidings and our mother sage met with the king asking to see the items in his possession she then decided that a second group should venture forth into the mountains her plan was to send a specially selected sage and a person from each of the six kingdoms so recently at peace to cross the mountains the great spirit dragontooth also heard of the quest and sent one of his loyal servants to aid us and represent the spirits themselves
7353354 he said that you were the most worthy man he could suggest for such a journey
7353355 by canoe to east river and up the river to nagling falls from there we will leave the canoes and follow the river north to its source and then up and over the spine of the greater vandhorns
7353356 they say that it is too far from the rivers source to the other side many have tried looking for a route to the north and the exotic goods that the torgwhazi monopolize
7353357 perhaps but that was the way of the last expedition
7353358 ananse you will travel with talus and i you three together in the other canoe and krag and gaethan in the last

7353367 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7353368 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7353369 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati

7353388 picnics on the beach is the one area of an otherwise discordant marriage where our parents are in harmonious if tacit agreement to be out of the house out of doors to be sitting on the sand or on smooth rocks with the sounds of the sea making unnecessary any attempt at conversation this has for them it would seem a significance of almost religious intensity notwithstanding the acrimonious preparations always attendant on the these regular family outings the truth of the matter is our beach picnics have a far greater importance for us than simply the eating of meals outside they are a form of salvation for our mother and father and so by association for their children

7353393 as time passed we have lost knowledge of the precise location of the temple and anyone entering the temple mount is liable to unwittingly enter the area of the temple and the holy of holies
7353394 entrance to the temple mount and the defilement of the holy of holies is more severe than any of the violations in the torah
7353395 the vast majority of haredim are opposed to the use of violence
7353396 but when the iniquities are taking place right next door anybody in their right mind would do what it takes to put an end to the madness
7353397 it was fair in that it provides us time to make various arguments about the plant and the challenges
7353398 it provides an opportunity for us to demonstrate the potential impact there does not seem to be much gained and potentially a lot would be affected by cooling towers in the end it makes more sense to continue the current cooling system
7353399 for decades indian point has maintained that its cooling systems have no impact on hudson river fish at long last the dec has put an end to this fiction
7353400 riverkeeper is very pleased that the dec has taken this aggressive position to enforce the clean water act

7353420 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
7353421 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
7353422 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
7353423 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
7353424 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
7353425 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true

7353434 if bce gets taken out in private equity whats to stop somebody from going after telus
7353435 so theres still upside even at these prices for telus
7353436 meanwhile for bce its arguable that its quite a bit over its net asset value
7353437 this is potentially powerful as its illegal under uk and european law to abuse a dominant position in a market
7353438 two of the ways you could abuse a dominant position are by refusing to supply a product which you have previously supplied or through excessive pricing but it would be very difficult to show sky was dominant in the supply of basic channels as there are plenty of other providers of that kind of content

7353469 its probably the toughest question of all at the moment
7353470 we are at a very interesting juncture because chinese demand is proving to be more cyclical than most people expected
7353471 if china can arrest the slide in its industrial production by the first quarter of next year we may see a reversal of the swoon we are seeing now at the moment
7353472 if you are a super cyclist there are some very good buying opportunities out there if you are more circumspect you may want to sit it out until the story with china becomes clearer next year
7353473 i think we could see a strong rally in the last three months of this year as china increases production again after the olympics
7353474 the market which has become very short term focused will extend its focus back to the longer term
7353475 the amount of investors placing bets that the oil price will fall in the past two months has soared
7353476 the outlook for the united states and western europe remains bleak but the outlook for china is far less certain
7353477 for five years commodities prices have risen across the board but we are starting to see much more widespread variation in the last year or so

7353723 la misi n de pedro y de sus sucesores es precisamente la de servir a esta unidad de la nica iglesia de dios formada por jud os y paganos
7353724 el ministerio indispensable de pedro es el de hacer que la iglesia no se identifique nunca con una sola naci n con una sola cultura sino que sea la iglesia de todos los pueblos para hacer presente entre los hombres marcados por numerosas divisiones y contrastes la paz de dios y la fuerza renovadora de su amor
7353725 servir por tanto a la unidad interior que proviene de la paz de dios la unidad de cuantos en jesucristo se han convertido en hermanos y hermanas sta es la misi n peculiar del papa obispo de roma y sucesor de pedro
7353726 advierto cada vez m s el compromiso y la importancia del servicio a la iglesia y al mundo que el se or me ha confiado por esto os pido queridos hermanos y hermanas que me sosteng is con vuestra oraci n para que fieles a cristo podamos juntos anunciar y testimoniar su presencia en este nuestro tiempo

7353731 posiciones enfrentadas nacionalistas que tan tr gicas consecuencias han producido en otras pocas hist ricas
7353732 los acontecimientos recientes han debilitado en muchos la confianza de que experiencias similares perteneciesen definitivamente al pasado
7353733 es necesario en cambio comprometerse activamente para que se rechace la tentaci n de afrontar nuevas situaciones con viejos sistemas
7353734 es necesario profundizar en la conciencia de estar unidos por un mismo destino que en ltima instancia es un destino trascendente
7353735 la fuerza moral del derecho de las negociaciones justas y transparentes para dirimir las controversias basadas en la relaci n entre integridad territorial y autodeterminaci n de los pueblos fidelidad a la palabra dada b squeda del bien com n

7353754 i heard the prophet saying the sun hadnt been withheld or returned for anyone except for prophet usha bin noon joshua when he walked towards jerusalem at night
7353755 the prophet said my heirs are not to inherit what i have left
7353756 prophet muhammad s said to his uncle abu talib say there is no god but allah swt until allah swt revealed to the prophet surely you cannot guide whom you love 28 56
7353757 muawiya had forced some of the prophets s companions and some of the companions successors to narrate bad traditions about ali to defame and disavow him he gave them bribes for that so they fabricated what satisfied him among them were abu hurayra amr bin al aass and al mugheera bin shuba among the successors was urwa bin az zubayr
7353758 when abu hurayra came to iraq with muawiya in the year of jamaa he came to the mosque of kufa
7353759 o people of iraq you say that i fabricate allah swt and his apostles sayings to be in hell
7353760 every apostle had a sanctum my sanctum is medina whoever spoils in medina will be cursed by allah swt the angels and all the people

7353764 soy un viejo partidario de roe vs wade la sentencia que legaliz el aborto en usa y del derecho de la mujer a elegir
7353765 no dar ning n cargo a nadie que no est de acuerdo con esa sentencia
7353766 libre elecci n el derecho al aborto sin restricciones era una cuesti n fundamental
7353767 cada vez m s a menudo las nuevas generaciones miran a un ideal representado por los actores de cine por los personajes y mitos de la televisi n y del espect culo por los atletas por los jugadores de f tbol etc
7353768 el verdadero interrogante que se esconde tras la palabra protagonismo es en qu consiste la felicidad
7353769 todos nosotros a dos mil a os de distancia podemos a n considerarnos hijos de su predicaci n y nuestra civilizaci n se sabe deudora de este hombre precisamente por los valores que est n en su fundamento
7353770 y sin embargo observa la existencia de san pablo est bien lejos de las luces de las candilejas y de los reconocimientos p blicos
7353771 qu significa para el cristiano un logro qu nos dicen las vidas de tantos santos que han transcurrido su existencia retirados en los conventos
7353772 el hombre est hecho para el cumplimiento eterno de su existencia
7353773 el cumplimiento de lo humano prosigue el cardenal es el conocimiento de dios por quien toda persona ha sido creada y a quien tiende con todas las fibras de su ser para conseguir esto no sirven ni la fama ni el xito entre las multitudes
7353774 este es por tanto el protagonismo que el t tulo de la presente edici n del meeting de rimini quiere proponer protagonista de su existencia es el que ofrece su vida a dios que le llama a cooperar en el universal proyecto de la salvaci n
7353775 no importa si el dise o de dios prev para nosotros un radio de acci n reducido no importa si vivimos entre las paredes de un monasterio de clausura o si estamos inmersos en m ltiples y diversas actividades del mundo no importa si somos padres y madres de familia o consagrados o sacerdotes
7353776 dios se sirve de nosotros seg n su plan de amor seg n modalidades que l establece y nos pide que secundemos la acci n de su esp ritu nos quiere colaboradores suyos para la realizaci n de su reino
7353777 de que estas reflexiones ayuden a los participantes en el meeting a encontrar a cristo para comprender mejor el valos de la vida cristiana y realizar el sentido del humilde protagonismo del servicio a la misi n de la iglesia en italia y en el mundo

7353787 no no se trata de una menci n torpe o distra da sino de un recurso que nos abra a la otra orilla porque san lorenzo tuvo su sed calmada sus surcos regados sus labios no dejaron de cantar discretos y es un ejemplo de limpieza transparente en toda su vida qu agua especial l bebi con la que fue fecundada su historia y con la que enton la m sica de la entrega y la alegr a este secreto es el que nos permite festejar un a o m s a nuestro oscense m s universal para l esa agua viva coincidi con su encuentro con dios y su abrazo a cada hermano

7353836 some come armed with ten questions to ask your biology teacher about evolution a document circulated on the internet that highlights supposed weaknesses in evolutionary theory others scrawl their opposition on homework assignments many just tune out with a mandate to teach evolution but little guidance as to how science teachers are contriving their own ways to turn a culture war into a lesson plan how they fare may bear on whether a new generation of americans embraces scientific evidence alongside religious belief
7353837 evolutions biggest gains in public schools happened in the late 1950s free from courtroom drama when russia scared the united states half to death by launching the sputnik satellite into space everyone agreed that there was no time for funny business we couldnt risk getting behind the reds in science education the biological sciences curriculum study was launched and generously funded setting forth a scientist approved evolution based curriculum that schools eagerly adopted in the spirit of nationalism christians began folding evolution snugly into their faith at least until the young earth creationist henry morris called them back to task in the sixties and seventies
7353838 the fact remains that they are hopelessly ignorant of science this ignorance is exacerbated by the annoying fact that so many of them fancy themselves highly knowledgeable indeed
7353839 look the fossil record is the most obvious place to look for evidence of evolution if it were really the embarrassment creationists say it is how do you explain that virtually every paleontologist in the world is an evolutionist and if geneticists really could not explain how genetic information can grow over time one of the fundamental questions any theory of evolution has to explain why would evolution be so overwhelmingly dominant among scientists

7353879 i do not hesitate to proclaim before you and before the world that all human life from the moment of conception and through all subsequent states is sacred because human life is created in the image and likeness of god nothing surpasses the greatness or dignity of a human person if a persons right to life is violated at the moment in which he is first conceived in his mothers womb an indirect blow is struck also at the whole of the moral order which serves to ensure the inviolable goods of man among those goods life occupies the first place and so we will stand up every time that human life is threatened when the sacredness of life before birth is attacked we will stand up and proclaim that no one ever has the authority to destroy unborn life

7353923 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have
7353924 the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7353925 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre
7353926 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7353927 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7353928 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7353929 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7353930 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7353931 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7353932 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7353933 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7353934 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7353935 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7353936 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7353937 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7353938 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7353939 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7353940 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7353941 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7353942 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7353943 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7353944 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7353945 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7353946 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7353947 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7353948 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7353949 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7353950 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7353951 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7353952 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7353953 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7353954 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7353955 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7353956 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7353957 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7353958 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7353959 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7353960 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7353961 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7353962 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7353963 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7353964 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7353965 por lo que ha llegado el momento de tomar otras medidas y de hablar en otro tono para corregir la situaci n
7353966 ha dejado de jugar con el hambre de triunfo que le ha caracterizado es un equipo sin coraz n tenemos que volver a jugar con el coraz n con ganas esperamos que sea pronto
7353967 y de hablar fuerte con el grupo pero siempre pensando que el grupo y el cuerpo t cnico nos dieron muchas satisfacciones eso no lo olvidaremos nunca pero lo nico que queremos es que retome su m stica
7353968 el esp ritu que ten a el equipo se ha perdido ha perdido el coraz n y ha perdido la combatividad no importa ganar o perder nunca le exigimos al grupo que gane pero s le exigimos combatividad y eso se ha perdido por lo que habr que ver por donde pasa la soluci n y rescatarlo lo antes posible
7353969 hay que volver a la esencia de esta instituci n que pelea cada pelota cada partido con el coraz n y esp ritu que siempre ha demostrado el equipo y con lo que nos ha dado tantas satisfacciones
7353970 creo que la situaci n de pachuca va m s all de la problem tica de un sistema va m s por un aspecto mental de haberse conformado con todo lo que se ha ganado y hay que acordarse que el futbol es presente y futuro y todo lo que se gana pasa a la historia
7353971 hay que mirar para adelante la situaci n todos la vivimos porque henos dejado de hacer cosas los directivos tambi n el cuerpo t cnico los jugadores para que pachuca viva esta realidad pero hemos salido de cosas peores
7353972 lo van a sacar adelante y pachuca volver a ser el que todos esperamos
7353973 se dio por un gol circunstancial as que ahora buscaremos a como d lugar el triunfo en el siguiente partido con el apoyo de nuestra gente
7353974 goles errados en arco ajeno se pagan en el propio
7353975 es algo que ya preocupa porque a nadie le gusta perder siempre hemos estado acostumbrados a estar arriba pero en este torneo las cosas no nos est n saliendo y creo que es momento de analizar bien las cosas y corregir
7353976 volvimos a caer este d a hay que trabajar y analizar los errores para corregirlos y pensar en lo que viene porque el equipo ya no puede seguir de esta forma
7353977 estamos en un momento dif cil pues hace mucho que no pasamos por una situaci n as sin embargo no se pierde la confianza ni el trabajo que hemos venido realizando creo que a la larga esto va a salir adelante
7353978 hemos sufrido un poco por las lesiones y por la tard a adaptaci n al equipo de otros compa eros pero el equipo trabaja de la mejor forma para empezar a cosechar los triunfos
7353979 creo que el equipo fue dominador del juego pero creo que el segundo gol tempranero en el segundo tiempo nos afect y eso lo aproevech muy bien el rival
7353980 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7353981 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7353982 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7353983 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7353984 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7353985 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7353986 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7353987 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7353988 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7353989 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7353990 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7353991 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7353992 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7353993 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7353994 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7353995 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7353996 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7353997 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7353998 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7353999 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7354000 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7354001 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7354002 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7354003 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7354004 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7354005 who are open to doing something on the production side
7354006 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7354007 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7354008 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7354009 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7354010 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7354011 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7354012 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7354013 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7354014 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7354015 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7354016 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7354017 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7354018 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7354019 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7354020 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7354021 la periferica peccato che il piano tariffario non prevedeva il trattamento annunciato
7354022 their parents with the best of intentions have tried to shield them from failure and disappointment and in so doing they havent had the opportunity to learn how to deal with failure and disappointment and were all going to have to deal with failure and disappointment
7354023 when students are trying to get used to the environment and feel comfortable on their own and learn to make decisions on their own its important to realize for the parents that we all made mistakes when we were that age and most of them dont prove to be disabling or fatal
7354024 he was a leader by example he was a quiet kid
7354025 and being a sophomore at a new school youre not going to be very talkative you want your actions to be louder that your words
7354026 just stepping right in and being able to do that for us is a testament to him
7354027 he stepped up in the hole and was blocked by an offensive linemen and thats all we could see on film nothing out of the ordinary just a regular old football play
7354028 it was one of those one in a million once in a lifetime things that happens where the impact was just right to cause the damage that it did
7354029 his eagle scout project was to help us do the eating area by the cafeteria so he had an impact on reynolds high school before got to reynolds high school
7354030 i think that speaks to the type of man he was
7354031 suck it a little harder now and she did as instructed his hand went up her skirt inside her panties and straight to her pussy he slid a finger in and began working it in and out she sucked his cock harder and with a passion all first time
7354032 basil wainwright has categorically invented a process to purify whole donor blood in the bag and his invention of polyatomic apheresis ozone technology has created the most significant break through in the treatment of aids and degenerative diseases found anywhere in the world to date
7354033 do you find economic courses to be harder than pre med
7354034 if med school required self castration would you still go into medicine
7354035 if doctors earned minimum wage would you still go into medicine
7354036 if you had to pay to work would you still go into medicine
7354037 no tenemos la intenci n de ir contra un gobierno establecido por mecanismos democr ticos solo exigimos como ciudadanos que se nos respete
7354038 se ores de la oligarqu a seguiremos haciendo leyes para el desarrollo del pueblo para luchar contra la exclusi n contra la pobreza
7354039 el manejo de los conflictos no supone represiones si se tiene crecimiento y no hay distribuci n lo normal es que haya protestas como cuando se siente inflaci n o hay conflictos mineros
7354040 el presidente alan garc a tiene que acostumbrarse a manejar el modelo econ mico con presi n social y escrutinio p blico que es la expresi n democr tica en todo pa s
7354041 si robinho no se quiere quedar el club le debe buscar una salida
7354042 si robinho no quiere jugar me lo tiene que decir a m y no lo ha hecho
7354043 everyone has done a wonderful job of pulling together to help the people of georgia and we look forward to continuing to do our part to support these efforts
7354044 what does the united states expected to gain out of this china junket
7354045 when we do business with a country we never go to war against it
7354046 im here to talk to georgian leaders and our u s assessment team to hear what they need
7354047 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
7354048 we express our gratitude for your help and will never forget what you have done to help us in our time of need
7354049 there is an agreement between two heads of state and there has to be compliance
7354050 my assessment is that the russian withdrawal is now slower than it ought to be the russians need to do what they said they were going to do almost a week ago and withdraw
7354051 de lat moet z hoog liggen dat je als je springt hem met de nagels van je vingers kunt raken dat je hem niet elke keer raakt is goed want anders was de ambitie te laag gesteld de topvijf is voor ons onhaalbaar dat zou dus een zinloze ambitie zijn maar de topvijftien als ambitie is ook zinloos want dat prikkelt niet
7354052 elke euro gaat pas zijn waarde opbrengen na zeven tot tien jaar
7354053 dit is het einde van zestien glorieuze dagen die altijd in onze herinnering zullen blijven
7354054 de wereld heeft door de spelen meer geleerd van china en china heeft meer geleerd van de wereld
7354055 er zijn nieuwe sterren geboren en oude sterren hebben ons opnieuw verbaasd jullie hebben jullie als ware rolmodellen gepresenteerd

7354059 we should be doing songs with country rock and pop stars

7354062 mijn uniformbroek bleef haken achter een losse schroef van een vliegtuigstoel
7354063 onderdelen worden bij elkaar gehouden met plakband toiletten zijn kapot maaltijden in de eerste klas ontbreken en uniformen zitten vol gaten
7354064 internationale statistieken wijzen uit dat we een van de veiligste luchtvaartmaatschappijen ter wereld zijn
7354065 ik hou van itali maar weiger te vliegen met alitalia waarom niet ik heb mijn leven lief
7354066 guus is nog maar een jongen van twintig met een geestelijke ontwikkeling van een kind van negen maanden dat was even wennen maar ik heb in dit werk wel geleerd dat alles lukt als je het maar leuk vindt ik geniet van het contact met jongens zoals guus het is zo intens en waardevol
7354067 dat neemt al snel een hele dag in beslag je wilt weten wat je te wachten staat en natuurlijk moet het klikken met de persoon voor wie je gaat zorgen soms merk ik dat ik niet door een deur kan met een familie of zij vinden mij weer te nors ik kan nogal lelijk kijken
7354068 vandaag is het niks met hem hij zit de hele dag te slapen in zijn rolstoel misschien voelt hij aan dat ze vandaag thuis komen en is hij een beetje nerveus
7354069 we hebben op zijn bank liggen donderjagen dat vindt guus heerlijk als hij het naar zijn zin heeft gaan zijn benen slaan de eerste dagen heb ik echt wel lopen zoeken hoe ik met guus contact moest maken ik nam hem op schoot en zat in de rieten stoel voor het raam guus zat te schudden en te lachen op een gegeven moment liepen er twee meisjes langs die naar ons staarden dat heb ik dus maar niet meer gedaan
7354070 maar verder is guus een heel makkelijke jongen overdag gaat hij naar de dagopvang en s avonds ligt hij bijna twee uur in de jacuzzi zwemmen vindt hij heerlijk hij zwaait met zijn armen en kraait van plezier
7354071 ik krijg een vrijwilligersvergoeding van 45 35 bruto per dag de verdiensten worden voor driekwart afgetrokken van de huur en zorgtoeslag dus ik houd er nauwelijks iets van over
7354072 ik ben voor mijn oude buurvrouw gaan zorgen nadat ze van haar cardioloog te horen had gekregen dat ze nog drie maanden te leven had ze kreeg nog zeven jaar ik heb haar helemaal verzorgd de thuiszorg kwam haar alleen wassen toen ze overleed gingen mijn handen jeuken ik had de smaak te pakken en wilde het ook voor anderen doen de cardioloog zei me dat ik me moest aanmelden bij de stichting handen in huis
7354073 op mijn 54ste kwam het ministerie met een regeling om vervroegd uit te treden ik werkte in de jeugdzorg en voelde me allang niet meer zo gelukkig met de nieuwe werkmethoden dus stak ik meteen mijn vinger op toen ze vroegen wie eruit wilde ik vind het veel positiever om energie te steken in mensen zoals guus
7354074 de eerste keer dat we zonder guus met vakantie gingen vond ik dat verschrikkelijk moeilijk
7354075 guus praat niet dus moet je luisteren naar zijn lichaamstaal ik was bang dat ze zijn geluidjes niet zouden snappen
7354076 vroeger toen guus nog klein was ging hij mee met vakantie soms sliep hij de halve vakantie omdat hij zich niet prettig voelde een vast ritme in een vertrouwde omgeving is voor hem belangrijk
7354077 voor mijn twee andere zonen is dat fantastisch we kunnen dan overal heen kastelen bezoeken wat met een rolstoel niet kan als wij guus naar een zorginstelling moeten brengen om met vakantie te gaan dan zouden we niet weggaan ik werk zelf in zon instelling en wil hem dat niet aandoen met een mantelzorgvervanger weet ik dat guus het ook fijn heeft thuis
7354078 en uiteindelijk als deze eenzijdigheid of onvolledigheid in het debat voortduurt kan dit leiden tot stopzetting van de subsidie
7354079 initiatieven uit de samenleving op milieugebied willen we ondersteunen en stimuleren n we willen voeling houden met ontwikkelingen en idee n
7354080 willen we de milieuproblemen oplossen dan zullen we dat immers met zijn allen moeten doen betrokkenheid van de burgers is essentieel de milieuorganisaties vervullen daarbij een belangrijke intermediaire rol
7354081 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
7354082 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
7354083 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
7354084 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
7354085 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly
7354086 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much
7354087 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
7354088 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
7354089 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
7354090 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
7354091 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before
7354092 those days are gone we are working hand in hand
7354093 we are seeing now a synergy that is really strong
7354094 on any given day one of them will be our highest priority
7354095 what keeps me awake is making sure that our team is focused on the many threats out there and not taking any one for granted not leaving any one unobserved
7354096 busy ness produces barren ness if your schedule is just getting busier and busier no matter how noble the tasks but your intimacy with god is decreasing you will not be able to produce good fruit
7354097 when we got to san francisco i was totally surprised by the misconceptions that people had about wikimedia
7354098 its a charity nobody is making any money from the organization nobody has made any money and nobody will ever get rich from it because were never going to sell it were not open for business were not looking for investment
7354099 i remember saying in november before coming to san francisco that we were as unsophisticated as possible
7354100 now we are competent we have a basic idea of what we are doing and a team coming together to get things done
7354101 sue gardner has really been key in professionalizing the wikimedia foundation
7354102 before sue we operated as a community club now we operate as a community club with sound management
7354103 everybody is grappling with what to do about the decline in the newspaper industry
7354104 when i was in the conventional media we all spent a lot of time wondering what we were doing wrong i dont see it that way at all theres amazing journalism going on at newspapers and at npr to me its a market shakeout or a market correction
7354105 we dont yet know a reason for the decline but we suspect it is due not to the wisdom of crowds but to the increased level of conflict among community members often it is not the one with the right answer who has their say but the one who sticks around the longest and is best able to argue his case

7354570 het grondrecht op bescherming van de persoonlijke levenssfeer kan niet los worden gezien van de verplichting van de overheid te voorzien in bescherming van andere internationaalrechtelijk gegarandeerde grondrechten zoals het recht op leven en het recht op veiligheid van de persoon zoals vastgelegd in respectievelijk de artikelen 2 en 5 van het europees verdrag voor de rechten van de mens en fundamentele vrijheden evrm de benadering van het rapport waarin de vaststelling van nationale of europese wetgeving of verdragen die de veiligheid van de samenleving beogen te bevorderen uitsluitend wordt gewaardeerd op hun invloed op het privacyniveau doet te weinig recht aan hetgeen met deze instrumenten werkelijk wordt beoogd de conclusies van het rapport onderschrijf ik niet

7354576 er zijn in de wereld twee machtssferen die van het goede en die van het kwade twee drempels bestaan er die van het goede en die van het kwade ondoordringbaar is het geheim van het goede voor het kwaad ondoorgrondelijk het geheim van het kwaad voor het goede alleen de mens die gegeten heeft van de boom van kennis van az goed en kwaad kan beide geheimen doorgronden beide drempels overschrijden daarom moest christus mens worden om beide geheimen te leren kennen door af te dalen in de onderwereld tussen zijn dood en wederopstanding az doorgrondde hij het geheim van het kwaad en door bij zijn hemelvaart in de grootste hoogten van de geestelijke wereld op te stijgen wees hij de mens de weg waarlangs het geheim van het goede doorgrond kan worden zolang de mens echter aan zichzelf wordt overgelaten is hij niet in staat door te dringen tot het diepste geheim van het kwaad hij is evengoed aangewezen op de hulp van de goden als de goden zijn aangewezen op zijn hulp alleen een goddelijk wezen dat in en door de mens werkt kan de diepe lagen van het binnenste der aarde met zijn goddelijke lichtstraal doordringen en zo het geheim van het kwaad onthullen daarom is in dit geval een wisselwerking tussen god en mens noodzakelijk opdat het kwaad naar zijn wezen gekend kan worden en wel is het zo dat het goddelijk wezen de mens de noodzakelijke kracht tot inzicht schenkt terwijl de mens van zijn kant het goddelijk wezen de stof van het inzicht schenkt

7354578 daar kwam bij dat het intellect niet gezien werd als een persoonlijk menselijk vermogen in ons werkt volgens de arabische filosofen een kosmisch intellect dat we slechts tijdelijk in leen hebben zoals ook door velen werd gedacht dat onze ziel slechts een stukje van de wereldziel is dat we na de dood weer teruggeven zo is in gondisjapoer een mensbeeld ontstaan waarin de mens als passief instrument werd gezien als een automaat die door wezens van de maan die voor engelen gehouden werden gebruikt werd om de cultuur op aarde te inspireren

7354586 in fact this nonsense is an historical fraud because the vast majority of jewish people those who call themselves ashkenazi jews have no connection to the land of palestine israel at all as courageous jewish writers like arthur koestler have detailed see his book the thirteenth tribe the ashkenazi come from a country once known as khazaria in southern russia and the caucasus not the land they have used the biblical texts to lay claim to
7354587 jews fall into two main groups the ashkenazi and the sephardic who were once located in spain and portugal daniel elazar at the jerusalem center for public affairs wrote that at the end of the 11 th century 97 of jews were sephardic but the ratio changed dramatically over the centuries and by 1931 ashkenazi jews accounted for nearly 92 per cent of world jewry today the ashkenazim utterly dominate israel society both in numbers and control jewish organizations like the anti defamation league adl constantly target others for racism when israel is a strictly and fiercely hierarchical society based on race even among the jews the ashkenazi are at the top of course followed by the sephardic and irony of irony then come the mizrahi jews who descend from the jewish communities of the middle east at the bottom of the pile are the black ethiopian jews who have long complained of blatant racism underneath all of them come the palestinian arabs
7354588 the rothschilds exploited as their justification to seize palestine the claim in the old testament that the jews were gods chosen people and that he had gifted them the land of what was once called israel thats it no more debate required god has spoken its in the old testament and so were moving in

7354642 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes fewer than 6 miles out
7354643 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians
7354644 we intend to challenge that right backed up by warships and machine guns just as we challenged israels right to prevent us from coming here on saturday

7354708 there is clearly a lot of support for cyclone athletics in the community we practiced this morning and will be off monday so this fit perfectly into our schedule
7354709 i have not seen this many kids in one place in a long time
7354710 but they are iowa state fans which makes this all worth it for our team

7354781 when it comes to paying child support there is seldom agreement
7354782 mothers and fathers will either claim they cannot pay the support ordered by the court or that they cannot live on the support ordered by the court paying child support is never an easy aspect of divorce proceedings
7354783 support is usually based upon all gross income including overtime and bonuses for the past 12 months of both parties number of children percentage of time each child is with parent

7354798 this has been a truly outstanding year for our wines from our flawless quality ratings to our outstanding success at international meets these results indicate our constant drive for excellence across our portfolio and are a credit to our winemaking team
7354799 is that were starting to talk about our high profile athletes as brands that kind of language dehumanises people and we should be very careful about how we use it we give our athletes media training but do we ever teach our media what it really means to be a top athlete perhaps if we did wed have more of a sense of proportion we wouldnt laud our athletes to the skies when they win or judge them so very harshly when they fail
7354800 significantly almost the entire investment of r45 million will be spent in cape town the new facility will offer many new permanent jobs
7354801 are you better off than you were four years ago
7354802 you have to earn it first lady im not just some piece of meat you know
7354803 the doctrine is the product of a sociopolitical thunderstorm the differences between the parties are the pressure gradients that set up the flow and the warm moist air that feeds it is the ambient fear that we all can have about an unknown future
7354804 even many educated people are scientifically and mathematically illiterate because science and mathematics have all but disappeared from the core of a well rounded education in many places of the world many sophisticated and influential people today have a level of scientific and mathematical knowledge that would not stand up to that of a monk from the middle ages
7354805 if an authority makes a pronouncement doubting it or suggesting alternatives is not necessarily viewed as just seeking the truth sometimes it is taken as a challenge to power so a political struggle replaces testing an idea
7354806 so while scientists are skeptical of their own work and that of others official science speaks with the simple confidence that good politics and journalism demands but which science abhors
7354807 soon it is open season on scientific dissent by a mob of activist journalists activist environmentalists and self appointed
7354808 yes in denmark in 2003 a man was put on trial for writing a science book you can take the people out of the middle ages but you cant take the middle ages out of the people
7354809 the theories of basic science are written in differential equations
7354810 a solution of a differential equation is not a number or a few numbers it is a function a function is a rule between variables
7354811 the experiments are bedeviled by the fact that a turbulent fluid is active on scales smaller than the size of the finest experimental probes thus the measurements themselves are not of the actual variables but of some kind of unspecified instrument dependent average of the variables in only one small region of the fluid
7354812 there was no level of detail that can be safely ignored
7354813 that can magically cope with all of the details needed to compute all of the theory while securing all the necessary initial data to implement it
7354814 the dream of the strong ecm wherein perfect predictability is achieved through computation in complete detail died with the chaos revolution
7354815 something between science and art some are more science while others are more art and there is everything in between
7354816 unlike meteorological models climate model parameterizations have not been tuned after repeated experience with climate change moreover unlike meteorologists no climatologist has lived through repeated events in his or her field so as to acquire a personal sense of experience of what to forecast
7354817 a number that represents the condition of a physical system
7354818 if you join two identical boxes with the same energy and same temperature together the resulting box will have twice the energy but it will not have twice the temperature there is no amount of temperature it measures the condition of the stuff in the box
7354819 the subtleties of the dynamics and thermodynamics are simply unpresentable so the grand creations of the modelers have no impact instead the modelers must suffer the indignity of having the intellectual products cheapened by the portrayal as fancy thermometers they are not thermometers and global climate isnt temperature
7354820 i f you are calculating an index and the circumstances change the index must be terminated and replaced by a new one t rex has had it both ways it is an index whose sampling rules changed dramatically at several times but it has not been terminated particularly in the beginning of the 1990s data quality rules say t rex must be terminated
7354821 it is far worse to have to face it errors in ones work when the pun panel of the united nations on climate change has elevated your disputed work onto such high pedestal that it is virtually an act of divine infallibility worshipped by international media throughout the world
7354822 science by metaphor is always risky business and one misleading idea in this category has done more damage to peoples understanding than any other you have heard of the one that we have in mind the greenhouse effect
7354823 microscopic particles formed of every known substance that get carried by air movements into the atmosphere and slowly fall to the surface
7354824 we have blinds clouds and aerosols and air conditioning fluid motions and evaporation from the surface and we cannot tell what they will do could it be more unpredictable
7354825 that greenhouse effect is the metaphor to which peoples minds retire it is unscientific nonsense but it props up the doctrine
7354826 when water is forgotten as an infrared absorbing gas the whole unsolved climate problem fades from sight and the doctrine grows most public discussion of global warming in the past few years has been built on incoherent clich s and misleading metaphors
7354827 water vapour is king among infrared gases yet is rarely mentioned even though the behaviour of other infrared gases cannot be understood unless you can figure out everything due to water vapour first carbon is not carbon dioxide simple but it needs to be repeated
7354828 the icecaps on mars are melting are humans causing it
7354829 his views are completely at odds with the mainstream scientific opinion and they contradict the extensive evidence presented in the most recent ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change report
7354830 the assumption is in effect that unless something forces it from outside the system any particular average you construct e
7354831 there is little sense that more work is needed on the models models are not perfect they say but they cant be wrong in classical doublespeak they must conclude it is human moral turpitude that is the cause of the discrepancy
7354832 the specialists in the field may never sort out the relative stability of co 2 levels during the past 10 000 years within certain wide limits
7354833 in this one they explained simple model you can also get cooling by allowing a small variation in the fraction of sunlight that is reflected before it gets into the system and there are other arbitrarily fixed things that can be changed too to get nearly any outcome at all once you allow the things that are held constant for no physical reason to change you can get models that do nearly anything
7354834 a better approach than impoverishing people by reducing economic growth to reduce co 2 emissions to climate policy would be to continue pursuing economic growth around the world so that present and future generations will have the means to adapt and flourish in whatever climate they find themselves over the next century
7354835 the problem is that if we seriously look at the adaptation question and realize that it will be dead easy the whole heroic enterprise of trying to reduce fossil fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions looks pointless or even harmful nor would people be made to feel appropriate contrition for their sins if they could simply adapt to the consequences without much notice
7354836 if there were some climate changes in the category of our sun going nova or even something more moderate like a major ice age then all of the infinity of local temperatures would be saying the same thing namely that it is heating or cooling everywhere or everywhen
7354837 but what people have in mind here is that an unnatural warming has been observed here or there to conclude that would require some idea of what the natural temperature in a location is but there is no such single thing
7354838 humans have modified the environment in which they live and will continue to do so but to conclude that humans are the one cause of climate change is to make the mistake of picturing our complex chaotic climate as a thermometer in a green house
7354839 clearly we cannot say it is all bad and getting more bad as some seem to want to do we cannot function rationally this way
7354840 god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth
7354841 as for you be fruitful and multiply populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it
7354842 42 3 saw their oil and mortgage vulnerability worsen during the 2001 06 period
7354843 our research shows that the areas of greatest need in terms of public transport investment are the outer and fringe suburbs of australian cities where households are generally more car dependent and less wealthy
7354844 neither of these approaches is likely to achieve any measurable impact on the exposure to higher fuel costs faced by suburban households the evidence in favour of fuelwatch as a method of stabilising petrol prices is weak
7354845 fuel excise cuts of 5 cents per litre would have similar modest effect over the medium and longer term but would be achieved at far higher cost to government approximately 1 75 billion based on current domestic fuel consumption levels
7354846 despite many rhetorical commitments within australian metropolitan plans to reduce car reliance and promote travel by alternative modes
7354847 increased public transport investment in currently under served areas is essential more broadly urban plans need to seriously question whether they are capable of producing cities that can function under much higher fuel prices

7354850 australia lacks a modest income not welfare housing sector that provides a comparable level of security and stability to home ownership
7354851 a model of either cost rental housing or non profit rental is needed to fill the gap between public housing and home ownership
7354852 there is a clear equity imperative to ensure that this level of public benefit is shared by those in the outer areas of australian cities
7354853 modest extensions to existing suburban rail networks combined with comprehensively planned and high quality local suburban bus services would be a cheaper and more sustainable option for redressing suburban oil vulnerability than costly underground inner city services

7354889 its been shown time and time again that there is no correlation between years of experience and skill in programming after about six to twelve months working in any particular technology stack you either get it or you dont no matter how many years of experience another programmer has under their belt theres about even odds that they have no idea what theyre doing

7354943 i would but someone went and put a bunch of tangles in it by running their hands all through it
7354944 so the wife cuts her wrists in the bathtub and the husband comes in and finds her
7354945 then as near as we can tell a struggle ensues she runs him through with the towel wrack that must have taken some muscle he falls on the bed in their bedroom and she crawls out into the living room and bleeds to death the paperboy saw her body this morning

7354949 if i told you all what i had in my chest you would throw dung at me
7354950 they say that abu hurayra told too many traditions i swear by allah swt that if i told you all what i had heard you would throw dunghill at me and you would never debate with me
7354951 i had memorized from the prophet s some traditions that i didnt tell you of if i told you of them you would throw stones at me
7354952 i had memorized from the prophet s five bags of traditions i told of two of them and if i told of the third you would throw me with stones

7354958 we did a content analysis of the march 12th press release sent out by corrao and what we found were the names of 45 men and the name of one woman herself
7354959 this is a development slate more appropriate to syrian national television than to an american cable network owned by sumner redstones viacom
7354960 we dont know some studies have shown that when women reach positions of power they often pull up the ladder behind them
7354961 neverthless to have 45 men involved in developing your new comedy season and not a single woman should set off alarm bells to both corrao and ganeless and mtvs doug herzog that something is majorly wrong at their network
7354962 this years development slate features an incredibly diverse and versatile array of talent and concepts
7354963 our core viewers expect nothing short of the best comedy options and continue to connect with the brand weve built were confident that these ideas will resonate with them and will continue to grow the networks success into the coming year

7355000 there was an air of hostility between him and the qm people i didnt have any actual out and out problems with it but quinn did make it a point to come to me and thank me after id finished one of the shows he very seldom did that ed adamson was a real problem he was caught in the fact that this was his baby and that he was doing it under quinns umbrella ed didnt want to be told what to do especially since he was ill at the time so he figured he was gonna do it his way which he did
7355001 it was such a shock to everybody one day he was there the next day he was dead
7355002 and on the thirteenth episode ed died he died at home he was at my house saturday night sunday i got a call from his wife helene she told me ed had just passed away we talked about keeping the show going with dick donner running and producing the show but we were sort of on the edge with the ratings

7355048 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
7355049 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
7355050 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
7355051 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
7355052 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan

7355094 a gesture like this from the gaa would do far more than all the talk in the world to advance the cause of ireland for which collins and dev and all our patriots fought to achieve
7355095 we must consign to the scrapheap any semblance of bitterness and poison that might still remain after the civil war
7355096 we must realise that collins and dev had far more in common than divided them and that the politics of meanness begrudgery and division do not serve the free ireland that our forefathers fought to achieve
7355097 i often took inspiration and spiritual guidance from the sacrifices of collins and his colleagues when the going got tough collins got going
7355098 that split never occurred that speaks volumes for the sincerity and commitment of those against opening croke park
7355099 they accepted the verdict of the majority and the gaa now stands more powerful more respected and more united than ever before as a result
7355100 their respect for the democratic vote of the members despite how unpalatable it was to many of them was a shining example of our maturity as a nation
7355101 were going to get there i know we will this whole thing is unravelling and we are working from the outside in to bring these people to justice
7355102 witnesses to crimes and victims of crimes committed by these people who may have been afraid to speak out in the past are now coming forward
7355103 for example we intend to talk to people who escaped from this gang after they tried to kill them we will be asking people who shot them
7355104 the crimes under investigation include sectarian murders feud killings punishment shootings and other serious crimes that these people were involved in
7355105 our investigations are focused on forensic applications and there are a good number of cases we can progress because of the advances in science and technology
7355106 i could have been in retirement now but i took an undertaking to bring these people to justice and i intent to fulfil it for the families who are paramount in our investigations
7355107 there are people who were on the fringes of this group and who may have helped planned serious crimes such as murder if these people dont come to us with information then we will go after them
7355108 but this investigation is about going after the major players who committed serious acts of crime over many years
7355109 witness protection schemes are in place and people should not be afraid to come forward because we will protect them
7355110 we are positive of the government legislation we intend to use to bring these people before the courts and we also intend to link various crimes committed by these people since 1991 our work is ongoing and we will continue to explore the full range of criminality committed by this group
7355111 ive met with steve hobbs and i do believe there is a will among his team to bring these people to justice i just hope theyre allowed to do their job
7355112 although my sisters murder was before the good friday agreement i still believe that the people who killed her should be jailed
7355113 they may only do a short period of time for her murder but if they are in jail for other offences then they could end up being behind bars for a long time
7355114 i was told a couple weeks ago that there would be arrests and this wouldnt come as a surprise to me the victims families will be meeting again with the het to discuss the progress which has been made
7355115 we still deserve justice after all these years and we hope the het can help us achieve this aim
7355116 the killers of my son and other victims should realise that they wont get away with what they did over the years

7355190 aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as unionfs which unifies several directories and provides a merged single directory
7355191 stifled and tedious adaptation of an austen classic strips the heroine of her usual power of perception and tongue
7355192 rozemas point is that mansfield park and the amorous escapades of its wealthy inhabitants are founded on and sustained by this debased form of exploitation this is certainly an intriguing opening out of the novel but in doing so the film appropriates the moral high ground in a way that further distances it from the delicacy and ambiguity of austens insights
7355193 what the film represents is the marketing of a new jane austen to a post feminist audience now receptive to its reinvention of the novel
7355194 in the hands of a less talented filmmaker this extensive tinkering and modernizing might seem irritating and pretentious but in peering beneath austens genteel surfaces and scraping away the hollywood gloss that traditionally accrues to screen adaptations of austen ms rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high toned romantic costume drama
7355195 by breaking the seal rozema has freed costume drama from the shackles of tradition exposing its naked flesh the window that thompson unsnibbed has been flung wide fresh air tastes good
7355196 an audacious and perceptive cinematic evocation of jane austens distinctively sharp yet forgiving vision

7355261 hopefully this is a warning to some degree to lenders in indiana that we want them to be fair with indiana consumers

7355267 i hope this sends a message that british law enforcement wont stop at our borders we are increasingly working overseas and in this example with the vietnamese and thai authorities to hold these people to account and then get them back to the uk where they can be properly managed the deterrent factor is one good thing to come out of the media circus surrounding glitter
7355268 when we arrest individuals they are often people who have not come to the attention of law enforcement
7355269 we have a lot of non governmental organisations on the ground that will provide us with intelligence on british individuals
7355270 our tracker teams literally deter and disrupt individuals who are travelling abroad to abuse these children if an individual commits an offence on their soil they need the powers to deal with it we have been running specialist law enforcement training to strengthen the links between the organisations we work with in the far east and the uk
7355271 in millbanks case we knew he was in france and immediately notified interpol the serious organised crime agency soca and ceops it was then a case of waiting to see what intelligence came back we had a lot of calls from the public after his details were posted on the website

7355312 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7355313 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7355314 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7355315 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7355316 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7355317 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7355318 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7355319 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7355320 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7355321 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7355322 video that lists the necessary ingredients and shows some self described rednecks blowing up small plastic bottles in their yard

7355349 it was obviously due to a circumstance within that country which was certainly out of the control of the local cricket board and i think the whole of the icc really feels for pakistan cricket at the moment
7355350 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment

7355362 we were born of killer apes not fallen angels and the apes were armed killers besides and so what shall we wonder at our murders and massacres and missiles and our irreconcilable regiments
7355363 nature mr allnut is what we are put in this world to rise above
7355364 if apes turn out to be better than brutes even if only occasionally the notion of niceness as a human invention begins to wobble and if true pillars of morality such as sympathy and intentional altruism can be found in other animals we will be forced to reject veneer theory altogether
7355365 one is a gruff looking ambitious character with anger management issues the other is an egalitarian proponent of a free spirited lifestyle the chimpanzees hierarchical and murderous behavior has inspired the common view of humans as killer apes i have witnessed enough bloodshed among chimpanzees to agree that they have a violent streak but we shouldnt ignore our other close relative the bonobo discovered only last century bonobos are a happy go lucky bunch with healthy sexual appetites peaceful by nature they belie the notion that ours is a purely bloodthirsty lineage
7355366 he was feeble lacking the normal stamina and self confidence of a grown male bonobo when first introduced to the colony at the milwaukee county zoo kidogo was completely confused by the keepers shifting commands inside the unfamiliar building he failed to understand where to go if people urged him to move from one part of the tunnel system to another after a while other bonobos stepped in they approached kidogo took him by the hand and led him to where the keepers wanted him thus showing they understood both the keepers intentions and kidogos problem soon kidogo began to rely on their help if he felt lost he would utter distress calls and others would quickly come over to calm him and act as a guide
7355367 t he moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped

7355425 california is and remains the big enchilada of presidential electoral politics but i see both campaigns on a sort of low carb diet which will keep the state out of high demand
7355426 the fundamental reason is that california election politics have shifted rather decidedly to the democrats this is because the democrats have a sizeable advantage in los angeles and the bay area
7355427 and routinely if the democrats can hold their advantage in los angeles and the bay area they can win the state of california and win it pretty handily
7355428 every campaign likes to threaten that as a means of alerting the front runner that they may be in for an extensive enterprise
7355429 and in the past mccain has demonstrated some popularity in california its probably too early to tell but he will certainly keep that pledge if not his powder dry
7355430 clearly republicans are desperately waiting for things in the state to shift in some way so that theyll get an electoral advantage
7355431 california went to the democrats only one time between 1948 and 1992 it used to be that the map was in a different place now many democrats think of it as a lock

7355461 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7355462 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies
7355463 today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7355464 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7355465 but you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention then they get

7355477 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7355478 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7355479 then he said father are you still there would you come forward and take off my shoes so i went forward and took off the shoes and he wanted his wife to get the shoes
7355480 after they were shot they were hurting they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7355481 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die
7355482 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7355483 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7355484 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic

7355496 before the legislation was passed there werent many standards out there except for the regional information sharing system run by the fbi
7355497 it was pretty much up to local law enforcement in many cases to determine who belonged to a gang there was some access with information from vice detectives investigating drugs or violent crimes getting shared but it was very piecemeal
7355498 there are some parts that are helpful like the part that makes a drive by shooting a more serious crime
7355499 but im not sure how effective it will be in proving someone is a member of a gang
7355500 there should be a significant enhancement for selling drugs with a gun stuck down in your belt or for breaking into someones home while in possession of a firearm
7355501 as a bunch of kids acting out and not deserving of law enforcement tracking
7355502 with these newly trained officers came an awareness of the extent of the problem so long ignored
7355503 this does not constitute a growth but a recognition of what already existed
7355504 we dont publicize the criteria because we dont want to let the gang members know what we are looking for or they will try to conceal it
7355505 but a preemptive strike against all gang members is not the solution i liken the war on gangs to the war on terror that people were in agreement with after sept 11 but in retrospect we have grown to regret it
7355506 from what im seeing theres really no way to identify kids who are wearing urban wear as gang members
7355507 kids all over raleigh are wearing gang paraphernalia i see kids at the bus stop downtown in moore square throwing gang signs but does that mean they are members of a gang
7355508 i talked with the kid his dad was a chicago cop
7355509 its probably the toughest question of all at the moment
7355510 we are at a very interesting juncture because chinese demand is proving to be more cyclical than most people expected
7355511 if china can arrest the slide in its industrial production by the first quarter of next year we may see a reversal of the swoon we are seeing now at the moment
7355512 if you are a super cyclist there are some very good buying opportunities out there if you are more circumspect you may want to sit it out until the story with china becomes clearer next year
7355513 i think we could see a strong rally in the last three months of this year as china increases production again after the olympics
7355514 the market which has become very short term focused will extend its focus back to the longer term
7355515 the amount of investors placing bets that the oil price will fall in the past two months has soared
7355516 the outlook for the united states and western europe remains bleak but the outlook for china is far less certain
7355517 for five years commodities prices have risen across the board but we are starting to see much more widespread variation in the last year or so
7355518 this means you have to be a bit more selective in the commodities bets you place
7355519 clearly its a worry that weve got specific job losses occurring in certain companies but that of course is part and parcel of overall economic activity
7355520 i think its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what you have to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is in reasonably good shape
7355521 we did an examination of those suppliers and 46 of the 200 have a turnover under 50 million
7355522 we are at a point where we have to act and act quickly on tariffs
7355523 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7355524 was a lot faster than me and went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7355525 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7355526 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion
7355527 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7355528 i guess it remains to be seen its like i said last week if theres only one guy i have to race thats awesome
7355529 ich m chte dass die amerikaner sich auf die frage konzentrieren ob wir es uns leisten k nnen diese politik weitere vier oder acht jahre fortzusetzen
7355530 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen mr kloppers said
7355531 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7355532 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7355533 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7355534 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7355535 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7355536 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7355537 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7355538 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7355539 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7355540 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7355541 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7355542 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7355543 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7355544 we did our best but the best was not enough
7355545 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7355546 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7355547 we need to get home and get on with that now
7355548 since crc took over responsibility for our it we have gained a level of confidence in our infrastructure from the optimum performance of our individual workstations to our servers
7355549 crc came in and made it very easy for us they provided us with the proper training tools that we needed they provided us with the right support
7355550 we dont give away our customers exposure mr smith said yesterday adding the bank had not struck a specific provision against its exposure to b amp b
7355551 its hard to see how that one will unfold but at present i think the situation with the company is still unravelling he said
7355552 i dont believe that there is a culture which is sufficiently robust to prevent it happening again so therefore there has got to be some remedial action he said
7355553 the management and the ceo run the business were the ones who are accountable for the bank
7355554 dr le d t cet t 2008 tu ne trouves pas
7355555 i know i look tired but everythings fried here in memphis
7355556 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355557 i strongly resisted me iars attempts at cronyism concerning public tenders
7355558 it is also our duty to monitor what has been happening at the ministry
7355559 scandalous and harms the hzds and the whole governing coalition
7355560 the office for public procurement and the supreme control office must say whether the tender was in compliance with the law not the sme daily
7355561 the market is relatively extensive and there are many eligible firms here enough potential suppliers
7355562 so the suspicion that this could be an improper source of financing for political parties is real
7355563 i think that nobody who has followed public life in slovakia in the last nearly 20 years can doubt that there is cronyism in parties here and that it is also present in the hzds
7355564 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355565 er ist in seiner konstanz und pr zision einzigartig hut ab
7355566 eine katastrophe wenn man mit einem auto auf platz 9 kommt dass schnell genug f r platz 3 ist eines meiner schlimmsten rennen
7355567 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7355568 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7355569 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7355570 i havent had a chance to talk to him so i am not going to comment on that
7355571 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355572 that boulder thats been lifted off my chest was the size of kriv
7355573 the size of the lead wasnt as important as winning number one
7355574 everything is open now i cant say the final verdict about my future
7355575 i hoped that i would win the gold at the end of my career
7355576 i will probably have to continue to london i would like people to remember me as a winner but it is too early to say what will happen
7355577 as with all wrestlers who competed in his category in beijing he had an active balance performed excellently and fulfilled the hopes placed in him
7355578 it is ironic that someone from the former soviet union won the bronze for slovakia on the 40th anniversary of its invasion by warsaw pact troops it is as a symbol of how the times have changed in both countries
7355579 this slovak olympic team had great potential not all of which was fulfilled
7355580 this is in spite of the fact that we have three medals and in the ranking of countries we have stayed high
7355581 the biggest disappointments were the sports in which we had the highest number of athletes in the history of independent slovakia
7355582 so far until august 21 none of them met their potential except runner lucia klocov who narrowly failed to make it into the finals of the 800 metres they did not even approach performances as good as earlier this year
7355583 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355584 i would like to remind all the foreign owners of energy monopolies about article 20 of the slovak constitution which reads that expropriation is possible in the public interest
7355585 if they proceed with policies that go against the state interest and it is not only about enel but also about the attitude of foreign owners of energy monopolies we wont hesitate to wield even extreme measures
7355586 we prefer not to comment on speculation and political statements and we have not yet been officially told that the state would choose expropriation
7355587 gas prices are transparent in line with legislation and reflect justified expenses and profit
7355588 our price for natural gas is among the lowest in the european union while spp is purchasing it from russia for prices comparable with neighbouring countries
7355589 the fact that gas prices are making up a greater part of household incomes has more to due with the fact that household incomes in slovakia are among the lowest in the european union
7355590 the decision is not in line with the law and is not based on an objectively existing general economic interest
7355591 the need of the general economic interest has not been proven even though slovak and eu legislation requires it
7355592 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355593 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica
7355594 when we started this effort it was the only way for us to be able to vote in denver to represent the people who elected us
7355595 were proud of what we did were going to see it to the end just like our candidate we dont quit
7355596 since we never consulted with senator clintons campaign we dont know if the petition that wouldnt die had anything to do with the two joint campaign announcements made last week we will probably never know but it certainly made us feel good

7355598 as of august 22 we are restocking our stores with iphone 3g the 16gb model is available in most stores today and the 8gb model should arrive on shelves later this week
7355599 we are working closely with apple to get additional iphone 3gs
7355600 these will be coming in on a weekly basis but for the foreseeable future the only place to purchase iphone 3g will be in an o2 retail carphone warehouse or apple store if you are new to iphone

7355603 will work with all 360 consoles and will even be sold separately bundled with an even more expansive list of mini motion controlled games
7355604 this added period of one year makes the move to sap enterprise support cost neutral as customers plan their transition to sap erp from sap r 3
7355605 may appear cost neutral from saps point of view but when you include the relicensing fee to go from r 3 4 x to erp 6 0 it is definitely not cost neutral for those customers happy with their existing version having one extra year is nice for some clients who do not want to make the move yet
7355606 increased sap support charges can be offset by eliminating all unnecessary custom code support costs
7355607 the results indicate that over 90 of sap systems have the potential to make major support cost savings by eliminating or replacing custom code
7355608 we have many clients who do not see the value of moving to the next release that means there are thousands of major enterprise customers who will be happy because they now have an extra year to think about their upgrade strategy
7355609 it is as if you compared weather conditions in africa and antarctica

7355616 i take no offense on being typecasted as a nanny but i do take offense that the educated people of the world have somehow denigrated the true sense and meaning of what a nanny is
7355617 let me tell you what she is she is someone who gives more than she takes she is someone you trust to look after the very people most precious to you your child the elderly yourself she is the one who has made a living out of caring and loving other people
7355618 so to those who have typecasted us as nannies thank you it is a testament to the loving and caring culture of the filipino people and for that i am forever proud and grateful of my roots and culture
7355619 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love

7355625 necesitamos estar seguros de que estos acuerdos no suponen un riesgo para el software libre
7355626 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7355627 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7355628 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7355629 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7355630 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7355631 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7355632 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7355633 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7355634 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7355635 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7355636 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7355637 people from all over the world now will get the chance to learn more about the mamu their country and culture
7355638 its also a tremendous shot in the arm for the tourism industry in north queensland and a stunning way to celebrate 100 years of national parks in this state
7355639 this magnificent facility will be open year round weather permitting and is wheelchair friendly and accessible to people with a disability prams are allowed too
7355640 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7355641 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7355642 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7355643 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7355644 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7355645 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7355646 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7355647 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7355649 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7355650 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7355651 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7355652 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7355653 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7355654 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7355655 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7355656 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7355657 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7355658 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7355659 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7355660 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7355661 the union will not be wasting any more time or resources on nationals legal challenges
7355662 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7355663 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7355664 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7355665 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7355666 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7355667 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7355668 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7355669 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7355670 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7355671 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7355672 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7355673 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7355674 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7355675 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7355676 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7355677 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7355678 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7355679 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7355680 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7355689 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7355690 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7355691 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7355692 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7355693 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7355694 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7355695 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7355696 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7355697 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7355698 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7355699 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7355700 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7355701 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7355702 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7355703 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7355704 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7355705 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7355706 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7355707 ik eet geen suiker zelfs fruit en vruchtensap laat ik staan kip rijst en zalm is beter voor me en ik eet regelmatig een advocado ik begin de dag met een gebakken ei en s middags geniet ik van een kalkoenburger
7355708 we kregen daar veel verontwaardigde reacties op van duitsers het is over de hele wereld uitgezonden en het enige land waar men er problemen mee had is uitgerekend duitsland
7355709 it took off and reported a technical problem and tried to return to the airport
7355710 according to preliminary information 20 out of 90 people on board survived
7355711 the pilot has also survived but it is difficult to talk to him right now

7355727 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7355728 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7355729 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7355730 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7355731 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7355732 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7355733 bagaimana caranya agar si pembaca mengerti tentang hal yang saya sampaikan
7355734 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7355735 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7355736 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7355737 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7355738 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7355739 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7355740 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7355741 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7355742 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7355743 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7355744 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7355745 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7355746 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7355747 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7355748 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7355749 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7355750 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7355751 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7355752 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7355753 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7355754 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7355755 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7355756 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7355757 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7355758 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7355759 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7355760 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7355761 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7355762 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7355763 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7355764 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7355765 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7355766 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7355767 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7355768 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7355769 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7355770 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7355771 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7355772 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7355773 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7355774 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7355775 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7355776 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7355777 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7355778 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7355779 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7355780 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7355781 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7355782 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7355783 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7355784 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7355785 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7355786 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7355787 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7355788 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7355789 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7355790 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7355791 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7355792 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7355793 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7355794 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7355795 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7355796 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7355797 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7355798 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7355799 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7355800 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7355801 estoy satisfecho con la segunda posici n tengo un gran equipo
7355802 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7355803 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7355804 hey just give me the entire catalog so i can see where i am and see where i want to go next
7355805 here are the pages you probably want to look at next
7355806 com a internet um dia poder se fazer de um tudo menos amor
7355807 the road to the white house runs through the west
7355808 there has been a major political realignment in the rocky mountain west in the last seven to eight years
7355809 its worked its way up the ballot but has not reached the presidential level
7355810 no politician of either party is going to come out here and say im going to raise your taxes and increase social services
7355811 democrats cant sell new york style massachusetts style union politics out there
7355812 they can sell a new environmentally conscious pragmatic governing style
7355813 these guys would be republicans if they were 500 miles to the east
7355814 this notion that somehow were in some unstoppable democratic trend i think its bunk
7355815 democrats have had a couple of good cycles but that does not mean it is going to maintain itself in 2008 or 2010 and beyond
7355816 have gone from being pretty noncompetitive 20 years ago to becoming contestable
7355817 denver is the perfect perfect host city for the democrats
7355818 colorado is the great democratic story of the last two cycles
7355819 i see one of americas grandest columnists is picking up on our discussion of americas strength through diversity and renewal
7355820 tudo isto acabaria porque eles a oposi o s o capitalistas privatizariam
7355821 n s n o podemos perder nenhuma elei o porque o dano que fariam os pol ticos da oposi o ao pa s seria dez mil vezes pior que o que j causaram e eliminariam todos os programas sociais
7355822 it was stephen hendry beating mark allen 10 9 in the first round hendry looked like he was going to be beaten because allen had so many chances
7355823 i agree allen played brilliantly and will probably never play as well as that and then lose
7355824 liang wenbo v joe swail it was so close and switched this way and that
7355825 stephen maguire v neil robertson because of maguires demolition job in the first session it was extraordinary stuff
7355826 mark williams v ronnie osullivan it was an eagerly awaited match between two great players the first two sessions were close and in fact williams could have taken the lead but ended up 9 7 down with a session left however in the end we were treated to four frames of thrilling whirlwind snooker
7355827 the form of shaun murphy it surprised me that he didnt play better it surprised me a lot
7355828 mark selby losing to mark king in the first round nobody expected king to beat the masters champion
7355829 ali carters black for the 147 in the past his problem has been the inability to hold it together under pressure well he would not felt a pressure like the one experienced on that final black
7355830 ronnie osullivans 13th black for the 147 he punched it in from a straight angle bounced it off the top cushion and flicked the red quarter ball to go on and make the maximum
7355831 stephen hendrys three ball plant against ding the confidence was oozing at that point
7355832 ronnies final black to make the 147 it was historic because it was his ninth beating hendrys record of eight
7355833 stephen hendry winning the vital frame against mark allen when he needed two snookers
7355834 ronnies 147 was tremendous but ali carters emotion after he made his maximum was a fantastic moment
7355835 liang wenbos unrestrained reaction when he beat joe swail because that showed the raw enthusiasm of the kid
7355836 hendry giving his congratulations to osullivan after the rockets extraordinary display
7355837 unsafe release at a pit stop after he almost drove into the side of a passing adrian sutil
7355838 i think it is amazing after such a bad result we come here with a new track which was new for everybody and we did just such a fantastic job from preparing the car on friday and saturday morning and choosing the right tires
7355839 then the second stint i think we won the race there as the car was just perfect and was improving lap by lap it was amazing to see the gap increasing very reasonably then the last stint i think with the grip on the track the temperature i was on the soft tire so i could manage to drive really in a relaxing way which sometimes is a big problem but i was doing similar lap times so it is amazing how the car behaved on the last stint the car was just perfect
7355840 yeah i think it wasnt very clever from his side as even if he went out in front of me he needed to let me by it was a shame to fight with him in the pit lane as we were very close and i needed to back off and i lost a lot of time but fortunately the gap was enough
7355841 well because i stopped behind him in the pit stop and we leave together when he was passing me by i was leaving the garage so we were side by side but i was the leader and he was lapping it was quite narrow and the wall was getting narrower and narrower so i didnt want to take the risk
7355842 well we need first of all to look at what had happened as i have no idea why kimi blew an engine we need to work very hard for the next race and we will see when it is important to use or not to use the joker if we really have a problem now we are working to fix the reliability as it has been an issue for us this year especially the first race last race and this race we need to work very deep and i am sure everybody is concentrating and working very hard to solve every problem that we have
7355843 pretty difficult i think for sure you always think about it you need to bring the car home thats your feeling lap by lap especially in the last 10 laps there is nothing to do but just drive and keep the pace especially in the last stint as my car was just fantastic even better than the second and first stint it is even easier to control the pace when you see that you know whatever happens you can do a good lap even if i iost time or he is closing the gap you know that you have a great car that you dont need to do a lot just push a little bit harder improving the lap time it was just fantastic i think after such a bad result we did a fantastic job not 100 per cent as we still had a problem with kimis engine and we need to work very hard to fix that as it will be the key for the end of the championship but i think today we had everything perfect to win the race and to do a great job
7355844 we thought that lewis was a little bit heavier than me one or two laps not more than that in the worst case if it was two laps i think i needed three seconds in front of him and we were more than that
7355845 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
7355846 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

7355954 el a o pasado se estuvo trabajando en un proyecto que en realidad nunca pas de la especificaci n el cual ten a que ver con todo lo necesario desde el punto de vista tecnol gico para identificar a los ciudadanos
7355955 esto tiene que ver con los datos alfanum ricos de una persona m s todo lo que tiene que ver con la biometr a o sea las caracter sticas que identifican de manera un voca a las personas
7355956 iba a ser una salida de la base nica de identificaci n una de las tantas en realidad y que luego tranquilamente pod a ser aplicada a los padrones electorales entre otros usos
7355957 la intenci n de crear una base de datos electr nica sali a licitaci n y fue ganada por la compa a nec pero despu s qued demorada
7355958 a finales del a o pasado el ministerio oficialmente dio a entender que se ten a que llamar a una nueva licitaci n pero evidentemente el proyecto fue perdiendo protagonismo en la agenda por diversas cuestiones
7355959 hoy existe una gran cantidad de informaci n que opera como compartimentos estancos
7355960 la polic a tiene su base la ciudad de buenos aires emite la licencia de conducir y tiene su propia base entonces cada uno tiene su base sin intercomunicar y eso duplica el esfuerzo a la hora de la disponibilidad de datos
7355961 en este momento estamos orientados a mejorar los sistemas de documentaci n y gesti n
7355962 la preocupaci n pasa por cambiar el modo en que se realizan los tr mites por modernizar lo que todav a se hace de manera manual tenemos el objetivo de concretar una base de datos nica pero lo cierto es que todav a muchas cosas se hacen en papel
7355963 primero necesitamos contar con una base s lida de datos concretar la digitalizaci n de los datos volver electr nicos muchos procesos nos falta desarrollar la plataforma tecnol gica que nos coloque en ese camino
7355964 tenemos el sistema pero todav a no lo pudimos utilizar no cumplimos con la fase previa de reordenar los procesos y la documentaci n cuando contemos con la plataforma reci n ah podremos usar el aparato que en este momento est vac o
7355965 est establecido poner en marcha el sistema afis en el corto plazo
7355966 el plan consiste en comenzar la recolecci n de huellas aunque eso se har a de manera paulatina y por demanda
7355967 para ello estamos trabajando con personal propio y profesionales de la universidad tecnol gica nacional utn los centros ser n alrededor de 25 y estar n ubicados en capital federal algunas localidades de la provincia de buenos aires y el resto de las principales ciudades del interior del pa s
7355968 si logramos hacer eficiente la plataforma de tr mites en la que estamos trabajando podemos decir que habremos plantado la primera semilla
7355969 luego de eso habr que trabajar en la expansi n de la firma digital y la posibilidad de insertar todos los datos de autenticaci n de una persona en un dispositivo a partir de ah se podr plantear al dni electr nico como una posibilidad concreta
7355970 uno o dos a os de pruebas piloto ser a lo aconsejable
7355971 las actividades de comercio electr nico las transacciones bancarias por internet el pago electr nico y los tr mites con los organismos estatales
7355972 el paso se va dando de manera paulatina nunca se ve un cambio abrupto del dni y por citar un caso espa a comenz a emitir el documento hace apenas dos a os y hoy ya superaron los 5 millones de dni emitidos
7355973 por lo general y como pasa en europa el dni es subsidiado tiene un determinado precio al p blico bajo a diferencia de lo que sucede con el pasaporte
7355974 un dni electr nico no puede ser demasiado caro en tanto est s obligando al ciudadano a tenerlo y s lo se requiere de un chip capaz de almacenar todos los datos e informaci n que el usuario debe tener disponible para cualquier proceso

7355984 this the rsp program gives them a chance to actually get to learn the information before they get to basic training basic training has a lot higher pace and they just basically roll through the information here we actually have the time to set down and break it down and bring it down to their level
7355985 its a privilege and an honor really both my grandpas were in the us army and i wanted to follow in their footsteps they were the best role models i ever had and im really close with both my grandpas
7355986 we expect between 4 700 and 5 000 students to report for the first day of classes with more to filter in within the next few weeks
7355987 our teaching staff returned to work this past week and participated in teacher inservice activities and the districts annual convocation at greenville high school
7355988 there will obviously be more traffic at these locations than theres been the last two months but especially on the first day of school
7355989 its very common for parents even those who typically send their children to school on the bus to bring them to school the first day its traditional so its understandable that there will be more traffic
7355990 the people we deliver to are so grateful for every meal and really express their gratitude for some of them this is the only hot meal they may get in a day and i believe some would go hungry without this program
7355991 with palestine now considered a certified retirement community go texan certified retirement community and more retirement aged people moving to our area palestine needs to have a nice senior citizens center that will offer activities and services
7355992 eventually these drivers are going to retire and we are going to need more volunteers

7355994 i hope more people will volunteer their time and i hope more people will consider donating to the building fund
7355995 i mean you cant get much closer to perfection than the atlantic full moon night
7355996 you know sowing a field here is different than sowing a field in the us i was picturing the midwest farmlands before you could even think about plowing a field youd have to get all the stones out good ground doesnt just happen its made

7356002 i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations
7356003 if the mccain camp does that they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and put the conservative movement in the bleachers
7356004 dont believe what i say believe what you used to believe before i opened my mouth
7356005 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
7356006 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7356007 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7356008 nobody cares about the real world enough to ignore it
7356009 were very proud of the new center and the families that have experienced it seem to be very pleased too thats the bottom line
7356010 but hopefully it can give their family a little strength to keep on with their lives and keep his memory alive
7356011 this match is a culmination of the vision and dream hugh gave to our team four years ago
7356012 it seemed so very far away but he talked about it with great conviction and impressed upon us the need to believe and then do the work to achieve it
7356013 this team that a year ago no one would consider to be worthy of olympic champions has proved everyone wrong
7356014 on the one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and i ache for my wife for our family and for the loss
7356015 on the other hand im also extremely proud of our team and for usa volleyball as an organization and what weve been able to achieve over these years
7356016 i think we did a hell of a job of putting america back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7356017 we have plenty of time to sort through it but they need some time off
7356018 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7356019 theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7356020 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that
7356021 he gave us such an emotional speech and it moved us all
7356022 we all suffered the pain that he felt when he lost and we wanted to share this with him
7356023 the two icons of the games were michael phelps and usain bolt
7356024 its important that our teams do well because so many kids get their start in sports on a team
7356025 no one quit and we kept working harder with different coaches
7356026 finally terry arrived our only goal was to get up on the podium we talked about that for the last four years and stressed it more this last year for us just to be here all of us playing together to me thats the proudest moment
7356027 it was painful to lose like that nobody expected us to be here
7356028 i have two young girls and family is definitely the most important thing in my life
7356029 one of the soldiers he thought he was about to go home but the medical staff said the injury wasnt bad enough for him to leave
7356030 then the soldier said so what i should have lost my arm in order for me to go home
7356031 i dont say you do an eye for an eye but he just shot up some of our guys and were taking care of him
7356032 my fathers military background was the whole reason i made the trip to afghanistan
7356033 they dont just flip those out and here tommie had them hanging all around like he had just won some gold medals at the olympics
7356034 i asked him if i could have a couple and he said
7356035 i was in maintenance so we supported soldiers but didnt really have to get out there and get dirty
7356036 the only thing that really plagued me was the threats we kept getting from saddam hussein about chemical warfare
7356037 man we stayed in the mop suits in that heat for protection against chemicals i think i had to scrape mine off it was just the heightened tension of what could possibly happen and ill tell you this ive never seen so many soldiers wanting to know jesus
7356038 i thank god every day that nothing happened to me
7356039 and i have one acronym for war we are ridiculous
7356040 the guy didnt even really know why he was over there
7356041 a lot of guys i talked to over there dont even know the reason why they are over there fighting
7356042 little things mean a lot to them phone cards oreo cookies stuff like that
7356043 if i had a chance to speak to obama i would commend him on his great journey
7356044 i would tell him whenever something negative comes along to just block it out
7356045 if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck its a duck
7356046 ive been in denver many times and im not surprised its dressed itself up for this great occasion and well have a good time
7356047 street closures a lot of people a lot of bikes a lot of tents
7356048 ive seen a lot more police cars and swat teams
7356049 we are seeing businesses open and employees interested and excited about coming down
7356050 after 15 to 18 months of really hard work in getting the convention and putting it on i think mostly what were feeling is tremendous civic pride
7356051 we had 117 people give up their spot and about 78 percent of them indicated theyd use public transportation to get here
7356052 we prepared a map for everyone with green lines for streets that were open to make sure that our associates looked for alternate ways to get there
7356053 i take the bus and ill put my bike on the bus to make sure that if theres a traffic jam ive got a way to go
7356054 and ive left a few extra sets of clothes at the office so im ready
7356055 civilizaci n y barbarie en la europa del siglo xx
7356056 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
7356057 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
7356058 bring the best brains in the world to bear on problems of the future
7356059 marxism is simultaneously a victory of the external active man over the inner passive man and a victory of reason over belief
7356060 david rockefeller is the most conspicuous representative today of the ruling class a multinational fraternity of men who shape the global economy and manage the flow of its capital private citizen david rockefeller is accorded privileges of a head of state he is untouched by customs or passport offices and hardly pauses for traffic lights
7356061 close trilateral cooperation in keeping the peace in managing the world economy and in fostering economic development and in alleviating world poverty will improve the chances of a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system
7356062 the overriding goal is to make the world safe for interdependence by protecting the benefits which it provides for each country against external and internal threats which will constantly emerge from those willing to pay a price for more national autonomy this may sometimes require slowing the pace at which interdependence proceeds and checking some aspects of it more frequently however it will call for checking the intrusion of national government into the international exchange of both economic and non economic goods
7356063 well i think you have some very valid criticisms of the commission and im certainly gonna bring them up at the next meeting
7356064 there is no such thing at this date of the worlds history in america as an independent press you know it and i know it there is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions and if you did you know beforehand that it would never appear in print i am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper i am connected with others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job if i allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper before twenty four hours my occupation would be gone the business of the journalist is to destroy truth to lie outright to pervert to vilify to fawn at the feet of mammon and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread you know it and i know it and what folly is this toasting an independent press we are the tools and vassals for rich men behind the scenes we are the jumping jacks they pull the strings and we dance our talents our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men we are intellectual prostitutes
7356065 my point is that far from being a coterie of international conspirators with designs on covertly ruling the world the trilateral commission is in reality a group of concerned citizens interested in fostering greater understanding and cooperation among international allies
7356066 commission constitutes a conspiracy seeking to gain control of the u s government to create a new world order
7356067 it puts emphasis on interdependence which is a nice euphemism for one world government
7356068 intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the united states
7356069 what the trilaterals truly intend is the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political government of the nation states involved as managers and creators of the system they will rule the world in my view the trilateral commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical
7356070 although the commissions primary concern is economic the trilateralists pinpointed a vital political objective to gain control of the american presidency
7356071 the presidency of the united states and the key cabinet departments of the federal government have been taken over by a private organization dedicated to the subordination of the domestic interests of the united states to the international interests of the multi national banks and corporations it would be unfair to say that the trilateral commission dominates the carter administration the trilateral commission is the carter administration
7356072 weve got to get off our high horses and look at some of those southern governors
7356073 the democratic candidate will have to emphasize work family religion and increasingly patriotism if he has any desire to be elected
7356074 based on false misleading and deceiving statements and actions jimmy carter in my opinion neither deserves or should expect one vote from the american people
7356075 ive looked on a lot of women with lust ive committed adultery in my heart many times
7356076 unholy self perpetuating alliances that have been formed between money and politics a political and economic elite who have shaped decisions and never had to account for mistakes nor to suffer from injustice when unemployment prevails they never stand in line for a job when deprivations results from a confused welfare system they never do without food or clothing or a place to sleep when public schools are inferior or torn by strife their children go to exclusive private schools and when bureaucracy is bloated and confused the powerful always manage to discover and occupy niches of special influence and privilege
7356077 if after the inauguration you find cy vance former president of the rockefeller foundation as secretary of state and zbigniew brzezinski as head of national security then i would say we have failed
7356078 the approaching two hundredth anniversary of the declaration of independence could justify the call for a national constitutional convention to re examine the nations formal institutional framework either 1976 or 1989 the two hundredth anniversary of the constitution could serve as a suitable target date culminating a national dialogue on the relevance of existing arrangements
7356079 the trilateralists have taken charge of foreign policy making in the carter administration and already the immense power they wield is sparking some controversy active or former members of the trilateral commission now head every key agency involved in mapping u s strategy for dealing with the rest of the world
7356080 i have no idea what motivated him other than the trilateral commission composed of bankers in this country and others want to expand big business he did it for the big banks of the world chase manhattan and the french bankers and for companies like coca cola
7356081 membership on this commission has provided me with a splendid learning opportunity and many other members have helped me in my study of foreign affairs
7356082 we share economic political and security concerns that make it logical we should seek ever increasing cooperation and understanding and this cooperation is essential not only for our three regions but in the global search for a more just and equitable world order
7356083 i dont believe that the trilateral commission is a conspiratorial group but i do think its interests are devoted to international banking multinational corporations and so forth i dont think that any administration of the u s government should have the top nineteen positions filled by people from any one group or organization representing one viewpoint no i would go in a different direction
7356084 it is quite clear that this group of extremely powerful men is out to control the world
7356085 world order in which multinational corporations can thrive without worrying about so called national interests
7356086 own 25 30 of all privately held wealth in america own 60 70 of the privately held corporate wealth direct the large corporations and foundations and dominate the federal government in washington
7356087 one of the most influential meetings of the powers that be
7356088 i think there is an elite in this country and they are the very ones who run an elitist government they want a government by a handful of people because they dont believe the people themselves can run their lives are we going to have an elitist government that makes decisions for peoples lives or are we going to believe as we have for so many decades that the people can make these decisions for themselves
7356089 top officials of the reagan team have sent a message to the moral majority it isnt your administration hell with them vice president elect george bush declared on november 10th in houston referring to right wing groups that supported the president elect
7356090 the new age has already dawned and a new financial world order is fast taking shape
7356091 the trilateral commission is performing a very valuable service in strengthening the ties between the united states and our natural allies
7356092 must be done by an international army and a world court
7356093 i do not feel that world federalism is a realistic objective
7356094 i would point out that at the time i was national president of the united federalists one of its more noted members was one ronald reagan
7356095 this may cost me everything that i have but ive got to get out an alert to the american people the trilateral commission represents a skillfully coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical what the trilateralists intend is the creation of a world wide economic power superior to the government of the nation states in other words what they are driving orchestrating meshing and gearing to accomplish is the new world order the one world government
7356096 shape public policy not through overt mass mobilization but through pressure on select arenas of world power and appeals to a small attentive public of elite world decision makers
7356097 development of closer working relationships between major federal grant making agencies of state and local government
7356098 i believe that regional organizations should be strengthened if elected president i intend first to upgrade the role of regional councils representing the federal government to assist state and local officials as well as private citizens in dealing with federal agencies i also intend to encourage the development of regional councils representing state and local governments
7356099 provide a structure for interagency and intergovernmental cooperation to establish practical and appropriate liaison functions with state tribal regional and local officials
7356100 two centuries ago our forefathers brought forth a new nation now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order
7356101 if we are to turn the founders upside down we must directly confront the constitutional structure they erected
7356102 it could happen that the present system of government would prove so obstructive and would fail so abysmally to meet the needs of a continental people and a great power that general recognition of the crisis would occur there might then be a redrafting of the basic law and if so then it might be that this model we have worked out over a number of years might be taken into account
7356103 the bearing of arms or the possession of lethal weapons shall be confined to police members of the armed forces and those licensed under the law
7356104 to assist in the maintenance of world order and for this purpose when the president shall recommend to vest jurisdiction in international legislative judicial and administrative agencies
7356105 edge of the sword that knocks the head off the constitution
7356106 creating a managed oil shortage to force support of its energy programs
7356107 our mythical energy shortage can be dismissed with a few statistics the u s consumes about 71 quads a quad is one quadrillion btus or 10 to the 15th power british thermal units of energy per year there is available now in the u s excluding solar sources and without oil and gas imports about 151 000 quads consequently we have sufficient energy resources to keep us functioning at our present rate of consumption for about 2 000 to 3 000 years without discovering new reserves even at higher consumption rates there will be no problem in the next millennium
7356108 in five years the united states could be totally energy free and totally independent from the rest of the world as far as energy is concerned
7356109 there will never be an energy crisis because we have as much oil here as in all saudi arabia
7356110 and in another years time we can flood america with oil alaskan oil and we wont have to worry about the arabs
7356111 the president carter said there is no chance of us becoming independent in our oil supplies that is just wrong we have at least 100 years of petroleum resources in this country
7356112 america has three trillion tons of coal out there ready to be mined all we produced last year was 590 million tons thats only one pound of coal for every 21 2 tons still in the ground the u s geological survey has estimated our coal reserves will last us well into the next century
7356113 allowing for the growth of energy demand we conclude that the proven reserves of these five major fossil fuels oil natural gas coal shale and tar sands alone could provide the worlds total energy requirements for about 100 years and only one fifth of the estimated potential reserves sources could provide for more than 200 years of the projected energy needs
7356114 the energy crisis is a phony a rip off a political con game designed to perpetuate a crisis that can be managed for political power purposes
7356115 increasing violence and terrorism is a direct result of an organized world wide plot to destroy the western democracies
7356116 i am afraid that the greatest battle of the era of the vietnam war will not be fought in the demilitarized zone north of da nang but will be fought in the streets of america
7356117 the first part of the yippie program is to kill your parents and i mean that quite literally because until youre prepared to kill your parents youre not ready to change the country our parents are our first oppressors

7356119 young people have no conception of the conspiracys strategy of pressure from above and pressure from below so well outlined in jan kozaks and not a shot is fired they have no idea they are playing into the hands of the establishment they claim to hate the radicals think they are fighting the forces of the super rich like rockefeller and ford and dont realize that it is precisely such forces which are behind their own revolution financing it and using it for their own purposes
7356120 in the evening we went up to the u to check out a strategy meeting a kid was giving a report on the sds convention he said that at the convention men from business international roundtables tried to buy up a few radicals these men are the worlds leading industrialists and they convene to decide how our lives are going to go these are the guys who wrote the alliance for progress they are the left wing of the ruling class they offered to finance our demonstrations in chicago l968 we were offered esso rockefeller money they want us to make alot of radical commotion so they can look more in the center as they move to the left
7356121 pounded and kicked the doors seeking to break them down
7356122 were not allowed to enforce the law regarding the disturbance of church worship services
7356123 slit the throats of christian children and drag them over the mourners bench and the pulpit and allow them to drown in their own blood
7356124 if local law enforcement fails then something else will replace it i do not raise the specter of a federal police force merely to frighten you look at the organized crime field we now see a substantial federal effort there and not simply because organized crime is interstate in nature it is also because law enforcement has failed to do its job
7356125 anyone who attacks the state even verbally becomes a revolutionary and an enemy by definition they are the enemy and must be destroyed
7356126 house to house searches and controls on the civilian population
7356127 until we can ban all of them then we might as well ban none
7356128 the best way to keep handguns out of the wrong hands is through licensing licensing is a barrier to gun crime

7356134 limitation reduction control and elimination of armed forces and armaments
7356135 disarmament act sets up a super agency with power greater than the power of congress which delegated it the law was almost a duplication word for word of a disarmament proposal by the kremlin in 1959 the disarmament legislation was passed for the purpose of implementing the department of state publication 7277 entitled freedom from war the united states program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world
7356136 has the authority to pass his responsibilities as commander in chief to the un secretary general
7356137 the u s government declares a ban on the possession sale transportation and transfer of all nonsporting firearms a thirty 30 day amnesty period is permitted for these firearms to be turned over to the local authorities at the end of this period a number of citizen groups refuse to turn over their firearms consider the following statement i would fire upon u s citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the u s government

7356141 were going to push through health care reform regardless of the views of the american people
7356142 theres also a conspiracy of silence on the part of the republican leadership in congress who provided the votes needed to pass this turkey
7356143 as of mid august 1995 the department of labor had certified 38 148 workers as having lost their jobs to nafta
7356144 free trade breaks up old nationalities in a word the free trade system hastens social revolution
7356145 the global theory of free trade is siphoning off americas wealth and bringing her economy to the level of others the theory is displacing american workers who otherwise would be employed
7356146 cause a global social upheaval the likes of which karl marx never envisioned
7356147 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
7356148 leading into beijing everyone was talking about the politics but i think once people got here they really focused on the sports
7356149 that is president hu jintaos style just let things go on
7356150 these games needed to go well to help china feel confident internationally the leaders will be thrilled
7356151 nobodys died nobodys been collapsing because of the air and the people who turned up in the airport with masks on they just looked stupid

7356153 china was authoritarian on the way into the games and it will be authoritarian on the way out
7356154 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
7356155 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
7356156 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
7356157 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
7356158 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
7356159 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
7356160 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
7356161 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas
7356162 el principal generador de violencia contra la ni ez es el machismo
7356163 los padres deben creer a sus hijos cuando se animan a contarles que sufrieron abuso sexual en el contexto de una iglesia o en la escuela
7356164 he conversado con ni as abusadas en el contexto de la iglesia y sus padres no les cre an cuenta si bien los niveles de abuso suelen ser un poco m s bajos en las iglesias que en otros mbitos el silencio suele ser mucho mayor
7356165 pero las iglesias se hacen responsables de algo muy serio si contribuyen a generar homofobia y silencio
7356166 que establezcan mecanismos de protecci n a la ni ez que designen dos o tres personas a las que puedan recurrir si alg n miembro de la iglesia quiere abusar de ellos ninguno tiene derecho a toquetearlo ni a seducirlo

7356175 i may go to the maryland cal game and i want to see if i can go to penn state michigan
7356176 i would say the federal government has the same view on this as we do
7356177 we want to do a stunning job of staging great ceremonies at bc place in 2010 we need to represent the interests of the country in the most beautiful poignant and emotional way
7356178 we want to tell a great story and thats who we are and i think thats what they expect of us
7356179 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
7356180 they have many people involved with us in many ways and theyre working hard with us to make sure we do the very best with the resources we have
7356181 were working very well together and i just think the federal government like any other partner we have wants to make sure we perform at a very high level
7356182 intends to invest 20 million towards the opening ceremony of the olympic games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
7356183 is it direction control veto its all much more suggestive
7356184 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
7356185 the memo is one piece of communication but the truth of the matter is that we didnt see what john furlong said back and maybe the confident message he has given follows a reply to this memo

7356209 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry

7356211 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter i am very proud of what our associates have accomplished in a difficult environment
7356212 the most painful and frustrating economic policy blunder of the past 50 years was the great inflation of the 1970s painful because it was the catalyst for three damaging recessions 1973 75 1980 1981 82 see shaded areas above all the while eroding living standards and seriously undermining confidence in america today the u s and through it the world faces its greatest threat from inflation in 30 years and as in the past this threat is being met with denial and political expediency
7356213 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
7356214 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
7356215 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
7356216 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds

7356225 the next stage of this shale oil deposit at the whitsundays involved the extraction of 400 000 tonnes of material next to a sensitive wetland and on the gateway of the great barrier reef
7356226 in one sense it is surprising were very much pleased about it

7356495 hopefully this is a warning to some degree to lenders in indiana that we want them to be fair with indiana consumers
7356496 these are people that were told if you sell your home youre not going to have to pay a prepayment penalty

7356511 our opposition to measure 50 isnt about children healthcare or smoking
7356512 it is about an unsustainable source of income for an impractical program when measure 50 fails to produce the desired income where will the money come from

7356514 the legislative assembly knew this tobacco tax scheme was a bad idea thats why they wouldnt pass the tax increase during this past session
7356515 now they have made an end run around the normal legislative process by putting this ill conceived plan before voters as a constitutional amendment
7356516 kevin mannix has always been accessible to owvas leadership regarding fundraising for projects or legal services for vets or discussions about issues affecting veterans and members of oregons military family
7356517 mike erickson has never been accessible to us but seems to have avoided us like so many other people in this constituency i have never even been able to speak with mike though we have called and have emailed him for a meeting
7356518 why would we expect erickson to hear our concerns take them to washington and report back to us if he cant even return a phone call when we he is supposed to be trying to win the hearts of voters he is absolutely the wrong person to be elected to cd5
7356519 this situation exemplifies the reason we endorse kevin mannix he has been is and will continue to be available to the constituency of cd5
7356520 kevin mannix has helped owva raise more than 90 000 00 since 2002 in support of our humanitarian projects
7356521 presenting him with this award is the least we can do to show him our gratitude and relay the appreciation we hear from our members and program beneficiaries
7356522 jake never wanted this sort of attention but our grand children are especially proud of the honors he has received
7356523 please consider rev ssgt jake deshazer for the medal very few people in the history of mankind have served their country and all of mankind has he did
7356524 at this time in our history we feel it is ideal to honor a man who was a genuine war hero who after his sacrificial service put on gloves of peace and touched the entire world with grace and humility
7356525 i appreciate receiving your comments in support of mr deshazer for this prestigious honor and will be sharing them with the advisory staff members who provide the president with recommendations in this area please be assured that your endorsement will be given every consideration
7356526 owvas financial goal for 2008 is to raise 1 500 000 00 toward several projects including development of programs in support of families of oregon national guard orng members who will be deployed in 2008 and 2009 to iraq for 12 15 months
7356527 i am confident that oregonians will rally to assist us as we prepare for the two deployments over the next 12 months
7356528 despite several last minute problems what matters the most is that our guests had a good time our awards were wonderfully received and members of our community see that owva is making a real difference in the lives of thousands of oregonians
7356529 our commendations are more than superlative they are sincere and represent the appreciation we feel for their dedication to those who suffer in the world
7356530 we dont have to worry about people saying we are a partisan organization developed for a special election or political activity
7356531 it was an easy choice for us to support kevin over mike erickson just because of the accessibility we have enjoyed with kevin over the years
7356532 mike on the other hand has been hard to reach and in fact we have never even spoke to him even on the phone though we have requested a meeting

7356543 one of the most critical needs for our veterans and their families is access to health care those living in rural communities often have no local healthcare providers who will work with tricare these new incentives will help encourage more healthcare providers especially in rural areas to serve our veterans
7356544 this is the kind of economic reform that helps our military members and their families where they need it most
7356545 for many of our part time citizen soldiers this revision will make nearly all income earned for service in the national guard free from taxation in oregon
7356546 eighty two percent of graduates of the oregon youth challenge program are still successful five years after graduating from the program
7356547 oregon war veterans associations leaders took it upon themselves to write and lobby support for the tax and health care benefits found in hb 3201 their hard work will positively impact all of our national guard families and we are happy to have had their assistance
7356548 this success marks the achievement of our number one objective this session
7356549 one of the most critical needs for our veterans and their families is access to health care those living in rural communities often have no local healthcare providers who will work with tricare these new incentives will help encourage more healthcare providers especially in rural areas to serve our veterans
7356550 we want to help triwest with its goal to bring 2 000 more healthcare providers into the system
7356551 house bill 3201 combined with other legislation passed this session will assist triwest in meeting this objective

7356650 mccain has been tested like no other politician in america as a prisoner of war he turned down an offer for early release because he refused preferential treatment
7356651 a t many of his mccains events his campaign sets up a screen and plays for the crowd a three minute film called service with honor telling the story of mccains more than five years of captivity in a north vietnamese prison after his navy plane was shot down in 1967 he was offered early release and he told em to shove it says one fellow prisoner of war paul galanti
7356652 when i was allowed the opportunity given the opportunity to return home early from prison camp i decided against that because i knew the effect that it would have on my fellow prisoners
7356653 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest
7356654 john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured offered early release he said no hed sworn an oath
7356655 t he vietnamese came to me and said well allow you to go home early because my father happened to be a high ranking admiral our code of conduct said that only those go home early in order of capture it was a brave young mexican american by the name of everett alvarez who had been in prison a couple years longer than i had so i knew i had to refuse
7356656 one time when i was in prison in north vietnam and the north vietnamese came and said you can go home early because my father was a high ranking admiral i chose not to do that

7356690 i signed with an agent but wasnt happy i fired that agent and moved on to another but now my first agent is claiming that anything i ever talked with her about is her responsibility she claims that if i ever get a publishing deal for the projects she represented she is to be paid the agents commission is that legal
7356691 i have three books with a small niche publisher since my next book is outside that niche do i need to get an agent and do you think im established enough as a writer that i could get a publishing deal before the book is fully written or should i not even bother to begin a conversation with an agent until it is completed

7356716 it seems that his rhetoric has been around change there needs to be change in washington and he has used for his political advantage this concept of the need for washington outsiders then when he has one of his first big decisions he chooses the consummate washington insider which i think is noteworthy general petraeus is an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country

7356802 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7356803 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
7356804 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion

7356806 once you understand this principle of thermal expansion you start to realize that even household showerheads and faucets are dangerous the hot water flowing through them could wreak havoc the president is committed to leading the way back to a safer time and a return to proven traditional materials which may not be flashy like metal but remain rock solid even when warm

7356879 as reclama es sobre o nosso aproveitamento nas bolas altas procedem mas voc n o pode olhar apenas para o resultado das jogadas preciso ver onde elas nascem e entender qual foi o erro que permitiu o cruzamento tudo isso importante e n o se trata de uma falha isolada
7356880 tivemos muito volume de jogo e isso bom conseguimos manter a bola no nosso campo de ataque e criamos muitas oportunidades n s tamb m aproveitamos a maioria dessas chances o que importante em uma competi o equilibrada como o brasileiro
7356881 auch wenn das schon seit dem ersten rennen so ist
7356882 die zuverl ssigkeit ist teil der konstanz denn wenn man nur ein einziges problem hat ist man nicht mehr konstant
7356883 zuverl ssigkeit ist der schl ssel alle m ssen ins ziel kommen und punkten
7356884 ja die konstanz wird sehr wichtig f r die titelkandidaten sie m ssen alle rennen beenden immer auf dem podium stehen aber derjenige der mehr rennen gewinnt hat am ende die besten chancen die wm zu gewinnen
7356885 ich bin froh dass wir nach dem desaster von ungarn so zur ckschlagen konnten
7356886 uns allen ist ein gro er stein vom herzen gefallen
7356887 felipe ist schon in ungarn einzigartig gefahren aber hier hat er diese leistung mit einer brillanz fortgef hrt die man nicht besser machen kann
7356888 das ist innerhalb der teams und aufgrund des punktestandes klar definiert
7356889 das ist ihm berzeugend gelungen kompliment es war ein fehlerfreies klasse rennen
7356890 vielleicht ist bei kimi das feuer nicht mehr da das sonst automatisch gebrannt hat
7356891 das hat aber nichts mit felipes fantastischer leistung zu tun er hat hamilton deklassiert
7356892 wir denken gar nicht dar ber nach was die konkurrenz macht
7356893 sie hatten in der vergangenheit eine fantastische zuverl ssigkeit und wir d rfen nicht darauf z hlen dass sie weiter probleme haben werden
7356894 massa ist ein gegner und hat die erwartungen vieler bertroffen
7356895 aber wir kennen kimi gut er wird in spa stark zur ckschlagen
7356896 kimi muss einen gang hoch schalten wenn er so weitermacht frisst ihn die formel 1 schnell auf
7356897 ich glaube nicht dass ich trotz dieses schlechten ergebnisses aus dem titelrennen bin
7356898 wir haben gesehen wie schnell sich die situation ndern kann auch wenn mir klar ist dass es durch so schlechte resultate nicht einfacher wird
7356899 jetzt werden wir in den n chsten tests alles tun um es noch mal zu schaffen

7356904 leider wei ich nicht was da passiert ist aber wir m ssen untersuchen was mit dem motor nicht gestimmt hat vielleicht ist es hnlich dem was felipe im vorigen rennen passiert ist

7356939 we saw the us dollar strengthen on the back of that news and commodity prices came off
7356940 the catalyst was the oil market then it spilled across to broader commodity prices
7356941 while the us economy is softening economies in other parts of the world are deteriorating more quickly
7356942 quando pensiamo al futuro di una casa europea jaguar compresa ambientandola nella prospettiva europea commettiamo lerrore di dimenticare che un mercato di complessivi 100 milioni di nuovi automobilisti cina e india in testa consumer da qui al prossimo decennio volumi tali da far passare in secondo piano la crisi del vecchio continente e come da noi jaguar e land rover sono nicchie in disuso l i nuovi ricchi e la nuova imprenditorialit rurale saranno il vero nuovo mercato per questi due marchi
7356943 non ce dubbio infatti che la politica commerciale di tata coinvolger la gamma e limmagine di jaguar e land rover verso una serie di innovazioni sinergie costruttive condivisione di pianali allargamento del portafoglio prodotti utilizzo di nuove motorizzazioni
7356944 temo insomma che una unicit indiscussa di filosofia costruttiva possa perdere le proprie radici quelle di una eleganza storica per noi europei e incomprensibile per i nuovi ricchi motorizzati indiani speriamo davvero che io mi sbagli
7356945 i parked the truck in this line at 7 00 pm yesterday
7356946 they will only give me 10 or 15 litres i wont be able to run my truck for even a full day on that

7356948 not only did he have access to the software but he was also able to get himself supreme rights that enabled him complete control over the system he was able to allot new numbers cancel existing ones change user profiles and even write bills of any amount he believed in upgrading his skills and every time the company introduced a new feature he added it to his access panel
7356949 posing as a company representative he used to approach the internet caf s administrators and gain control over their servers from the server he would download all the required information and softwares provided by the company he later sold them to mobile users he also sold large number of cloned chips in the market whose numbers and details are expected to be revealed in further investigations though the exact size of the damage caused to the company by him is not clear but it is expected to run into millions of rupees
7356950 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7356951 the government has used the olympics to display its organising strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7356952 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7356953 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7356954 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7356955 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7356956 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power
7356957 sports are just sports but this success will intensify foreign fears that china is becoming a successful authoritarian government confident in itself that can chart its own course
7356958 we had a great week of training in ocean city and came away with two good results against two good teams
7356959 we also saw some things we need to work on and well spend this week getting ready for the start of the regular season
7356960 leading into beijing everyone was talking about the politics but i think once people got here they really focused on the sports
7356961 that is president hu jintaos style just let things go on
7356962 these games needed to go well to help china feel confident internationally the leaders will be thrilled
7356963 nobodys died nobodys been collapsing because of the air and the people who turned up in the airport with masks on they just looked stupid
7356964 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
7356965 china was authoritarian on the way into the games and it will be authoritarian on the way out
7356966 the common refrain everywhere we went was where do we get these cars
7356967 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events that ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7356968 i said to my coach dont get any ideas because i dont want to compete beyond 30 and he said thats good because i dont want to coach you past the age of 30
7356969 whats poetry is it the fruits and vegetables and marketplace at campo dei fiori or the statue there
7356970 if god is not the soul itself he is the soul of the soul of the world
7356971 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys get a good taste of whats important in life
7356972 we were crushed by that i mean when you go out on the court its just a game of volleyball
7356973 for four years these guys have played for the common goal to be here for this match
7356974 we put so much effort and energy into this thing and we spent so much time together
7356975 hot lava have whip smart lyrics and digital era themes that run pervasive over their new debut album
7356976 which quite possibly has the only tuba solo you will hear all year courtesy of guest musician stephanie fairbairn
7356977 which also gives a more earthy feel in contrast to the bands synth oriented sound
7356978 youre romo like in your efficiency and big play capability
7356979 i find it to be a refreshing piece of work from dan a northern virginia based boys fan we are united in our hate for the washington redskins be sure to check it out
7356980 eagles fans who want to spy on the enemy should check it out
7356981 dude great site its good to see some knowledgeable fans
7356982 even throughout the dry period that has been this year leading up to the draft youre constantly finding gems to keep us entertained the landryhat has been my homepage for the last 3 months and its earned the spot for a long time to come keep it up and thanks
7356983 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site
7356984 china opened itself to the world community to an extent that would have been unimaginable at the time of the east west division of germany
7356985 when the chinese leadership sees the system questioned it does not respect basic freedoms as we know them that is why i am strictly against saying it is all good
7356986 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
7356987 t is the right place to be now sport has been the catalyst
7356988 the us government encourages the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
7356989 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7356990 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7356991 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7356992 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7356993 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7356994 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7356995 we were told that buses would not be a factor that we would receive bus transportation due to the fact that the walk would be unsafe
7356996 cars are racing up and down that street to beat the traffic on leesville
7356997 if it is not where the students can safely cross the road then we would actually transport them across
7356998 love feels no burden thinks nothing of trouble attempts what is above its strength pleads no excuse of impossibility for it thinks all things lawful for itself and all things possible

7357024 there is still a long way to go so lets wait and see what happens
7357025 i think i can do better than that so i am trying to improve
7357026 i left a bit too early it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refuelling we need to look and see what really happened
7357027 but these things happen in racing i am not too worried i still think i can come back this season
7357028 it was not a great weekend but it is not the first time
7357029 we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back we know what the issues have been but unfortunately we havent been able to sort them out hopefully now in the next test we can work a bit and try to find the solution for it if we get the qualifying right it will help a lot
7357030 i cannot complain with second place we have had quite a strong weekend
7357031 i have had a few problems health wise but still pulled through and had a great team behind me who helped me
7357032 i had the flu when i arrived i had pretty hard fevers pretty much every day and low energy i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which kind of nearly did lead to me not racing this weekend
7357033 i just woke up very very early yesterday before 5 am and i had the spasm in my neck
7357034 la avalancha se ha producido al amanecer en el lado franc s del mont blanc atrapando a una cordada de alpinistas
7357035 lo que se requiere es que todos los del gobierno se comprometan a dar soluciones satisfactorias la sociedad tiene que hacer la parte que le corresponda
7357036 el problema de las cumbres es que se habla mucho y en el momento no generan soluciones lo que hay que hacer es que cada uno tome su responsabilidad y act e para encontrar la respuestas favorables
7357037 es la preocupaci n n mero uno de todos los mexicanos pero se tiene que hacer algo dr stico porque hemos sufrido demasiado
7357038 estamos horrorizados por este cruel secuestro de periodistas y exhortamos a la liberaci n inmediata de nuestros colegas que est n cautivos debido a su noble trabajo en favor del pueblo somal
7357039 nos preocupa mucho que nuestro hijo nigel brennan pudiera haber desaparecido ayer cerca de mogadicio en somalia es un fot grafo freelance que lleg a kenia apenas hace poco m s de una semana
7357040 la alta comisi n australiana en nairobi est investigando urgentemente los reportes de que el periodista freelance australiano nigel brennan fue secuestrado cerca de mogadiscio en somalia
7357041 nos preocupa mucho la competencia no importa que sean marcas peque as o grandes y es importante tener la vista y los o dos bien abiertos no s lo de los motorola sony ericcson o lg sino tambi n de las firmas asi ticas
7357042 no way i looked in the closet like 5 times
7357043 you must not have looked under the big firetruck because thats where it was
7357044 to sin by silence when we should protest makes cowards out of men
7357045 the 376th air expeditionary wing provided two large fire trucks an ambulance and nearly two dozen medical and fire and crash support personnel to the scene of the accident
7357046 medical personnel have also been requested to provide support at the manas international airport terminal which is adjacent to the base
7357047 im profoundly humbled by the immense privilege ive been given today
7357048 sport is coming home and we are going to give those sports an olympic games to do britain proud to do london proud and to do the world proud
7357049 this is a great day for london and for britain and for the olympic movement we can say with one voice it is a great time to be british
7357050 the british team is ready and thats important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population
7357051 i honestly dont know what we could have done to go faster
7357052 if i had my day again i wouldnt change what we did we put together the best race we ever have it felt like we laid down every single one of our cards and delivered all the strength we had unfortunately for us the chinese had just one more joker left in the end
7357053 we are certainly planning future trips scores of people have been contacting the movement hoping for a space on the next boat we send
7357054 following irelands no to the lisbon treaty echoing the french and dutch voters rejection of the constitutional treaty in 2005
7357055 i am personally convinced that the cfsp can play a part in swinging public opinion back to supporting the european project i call this legitimacy through action from javier solanas address to the conference on 26 september 2005
7357056 the institutes core mission ist to provide analyses and rcommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulations of eu policies in carrying out that mission it also acts as an interface between experts and decision makers at all levels

7357058 including turkey written by the turkish ass professor in ankara mustafa aydin the future of the eu thus being entrusted to an asian non member of the eu he writes
7357059 in 2002 when setting up the institute for security studies as a distinctively european venture the unions aim was to promote a progressively more european strategic debate that would transcend different cultures and national interests in security matters an institute that would think european work with national institutes on joint projects bring the different national security cultures together and put each one into perspective with the general interest of the union always its prime consideration today although europeans may be somewhat prone to self doubt their desire for a stronger europe on the international scene remains solid and of course national public opinion is frequently more ambitious than governments in this field the citizen expects europe to be a credible international player influential and respected capable of providing aid and of generating greater security but also with its views and values of making its mark on the emergence of international governance in an age of globalisation the european union institute for security studies has fully succeeded in taking up this dual challenge of the unions coherence and its intellectual visibility the institute has become an authoritative point of reference in europe its publications have become works of reference on the specific manner in which europeans analyse crises and view the world the presence of the institutes researchers at many international conferences has helped enormously to increase awareness of the european approach to the major security issues the institute must continue on that course the union needs the institute to help it make sense of this complexity because foreign policy is no longer restricted to relations between states

7357062 jeg er personligt overbevist om at fusp kan spille en rolle i at svinge den offentlige mening tilbage til at st tte det europ iske projekt jeg kalder dette legitimitet gennem handling fra javier solanas tale til konferencen den 26 september 2005
7357063 instituttets kernemission at levere analyser og anbefalinger der kan v re til nytte og relevans i forhold til formuleringer af eus politikker under udf relsen af denne mission fungerer det ogs som forbindelsesled mellem eksperter og beslutningstagere p alle niveauer

7357067 ich bin pers nlich davon berzeugt dass die gasp eine rolle beim
7357068 aus javier solanas ansprache auf der konferenz am 26 september 2005

7357284 the event starts to hurt halfway through it so for him to do what he does after that last turn and go that fast its pretty much inhuman
7357285 yes i did but i was not going to give him that sense of satisfaction
7357286 i think it pretty much goes in line with michaels way of operating whatever comes up he can turn into motivation
7357287 instead of using it to improve what theyre doing it takes away from what theyre doing
7357288 it bothered me at the time but it definitely made me a stronger person

7357295 my longest relationship of five years has been with a married man named david antony
7357296 its a true testament to destino that i tried not only a wide variety of food during dinner there recently but some raw food to boot
7357297 granted i was there with one of my favorite people lady k but the place is gorgeous

7357300 the highest score awarded to an olympic dive ever another first how many more firsts can this child get can you find something else to be first in hes just done so well he deserves it
7357301 when i first met him he was pretty unhappy he wasnt liking the diving in brisbane at all he didnt want to do it wasnt happy being there
7357302 it took a lot for him to retire and stop doing it because it had been his life for so long he wanted to try and be happy again he took time to do normal things that people do
7357303 then after five or six months he started to really miss it again and he had the opportunity to dive with chava sobrino his coach he started that and loved it ever since every second of it which is great to see him happy all the time
7357304 he was only hesitant because he was worried about that factor of sponsorship
7357305 it was a bit of a worry but i think everybody has caught up now
7357306 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7357307 the biggest thing he was worried about was people paying more attention to that than his actually diving
7357308 and i suppose that kind of did happen a little bit hopefully now it wont be so much of an issue any more
7357309 it was his best dive and thats why we put it at the end
7357310 the expectancy of that dive was around 106 to 108 points but not 112 never he did it at the right time at the right moment in the right pool with the right crowd so im pretty happy and we got the right medal
7357311 granted i was there with one of my favorite people lady k but the place is gorgeous
7357312 is it worth it to ruin this persons day should i break it to him that a macchiato is not what he thinks it is am i one of those stuck up coffee shop asshole were is the line between loving coffee so much that you wanna educate the public and being a f ing jerk asshole stuck up barista
7357313 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7357336 when you know so much and are so close but so far from that great idea the hardest thing to do is to let go
7357337 to live in this world you must be able to do three things to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and when the time comes to let it go to let it go
7357338 suffering is not holding you you are holding suffering when you become good at the art of letting sufferings go then youll come to realize how unnecessary it was for you to drag those burdens around with you youll see that no one else other than you was responsible the truth is that existence wants your life to become a festival
7357339 one of these days youll realize how i was the one for you how you threw it all away and when that day comes ill smile and tell you the same things you once told me that youre my friend and thats all i want us to be and maybe if youre lucky youll open your eyes and see how those words can never be comforting and youll never say them again
7357340 we had said good bye so many times before but somehow our paths always managed to cross and we ended up in each others arms but now when we said this good bye i have this feeling that i will never see you again and that really hurts because i know that we are meant to lead our own separate lives and i honestly dont wanna cross your path in the future cause i dont want all these feelings to come back and have to try to get over all over again
7357341 i hate being put in this position im forcing myself to let go of the one person that i need in my life hes the only thing that makes sense but at the same time the one thing that complicates me i know that im better off without him yet i feel empty whenever i try to let go but i guess that emptiness is better than constant hurt

7357532 public sculpture that is static often figurative objects of varying sizes in outdoor public spaces has become one of contemporary arts more exciting areas of endeavor and certainly its most dramatically improved one
7357533 we lose about 35 000 a year in materials that are checked out and not returned
7357534 those overdue fees and fines they do add up so at our library with the size of our community in fort smith we take in about 100 000 every year
7357535 if people dont bring their books back the library may start charging more in late fees for other people to make up for what people dont pay
7357536 the question would be how many times before it gets put on your credit report
7357537 only ballers can fully appreciate the sheer beauty of a rhythmic scatter of colored paint on anothers body
7357538 its disappointing to have to postpone the tournament but in the end it was a rigorous process that was followed and in the end the security advice around pakistan has just been too tough to overcome
7357539 we wanted to see the process run its course and in the end we didnt have to make a call
7357540 the weight of opinion from around the world meant that it was an obvious choice
7357541 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment the right decision has been made and everyones pretty comfortable with it
7357542 the decision was due to a circumstance in that country that was out of the control of the local cricket board
7357543 yesterday london became the worlds olympic city it is a great honour and one that comes with great responsibilities in less than four years time our gleaming new venues will throng with thousands of visitors and for a few delirious weeks london will be the centre of the sporting world
7357544 today i can proudly say london 2012 is the next host city of the summer olympic games that incredible moment came in beijings magnificent birds nest stadium last night as the olympic flag passed from beijings mayor to boris johnson the mayor of london
7357545 we dont give away our customers exposure mr smith said yesterday adding the bank had not struck a specific provision against its exposure to b amp b
7357546 its hard to see how that one will unfold but at present i think the situation with the company is still unravelling he said
7357547 i dont believe that there is a culture which is sufficiently robust to prevent it happening again so therefore there has got to be some remedial action he said
7357548 the management and the ceo run the business were the ones who are accountable for the bank
7357549 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
7357550 we have these countervailing forces in the international economy we have a slowdown in the developed world and the continuing impacts of the us sub prime crisis the increase in borrowing costs that flow on and so on but on the other hand still relatively strong growth in china and thats good news for australia

7357552 its an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november

7357556 to have ups to have downs to go through everything and be able to accomplish everything you have ever really dreamed of it is fun
7357557 it is about being an athlete and bringing the most you can to the table whether you are the strongest or fastest that is what we believe going into it

7357559 david hales game was probably the best game ive seen from a north melbourne player in a long long time i thought he was outstanding
7357560 his performances have been really improving and hes actually playing at seven and a half foot now when hes going for his marks
7357561 and i think hes realised that and hes putting himself in a position to be able to do that
7357562 we checked our records and the name of the wholesaler that foodworks suggest who supplied the flowers has never given a brass razoo to the cancer council queensland

7357577 il federalismo puo essere una grande occasione ma anche la sciocchezza finale se viene fatto male dialogo e una parola che non mi convince e troppo astratto parliamo di confronto di accordo o di disaccordo sia chiaro che il federalismo ci interessa abbiamo fatto una proposta abbiamo delle idee pero non si scherza con il federalismo fiscale

7357597 the number of registered users on the big gaming sites is huge and rapidly rising this is a good indication that the e sports industry is booming and so is the demand for betting on esports our goal is to add another dimension to e sports by making betting possible and thus boosting the interest for the pro players and the great teams competing in tournaments worldwide right now
7357598 i am really exited about this finally somebody has opened their eyes and realized what a great sport we are part of and by offering fixed odds xlbet does not only show the world that e sports are to be taken serious but also offers people with an e sports interest a chance to make some money on their favourite sport and my frags just like soccer and tennis fans do everyday

7357602 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7357603 h uman activity affecting the atmosphere is very likely an important driving factor
7357604 it might be about 1 5 degrees warmer at the end of this century
7357605 but global warming as proclaimed by al gore and co is a hoax
7357606 it should also be remembered that science is based on facts not consensus
7357607 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
7357608 people have been led to believe they can get a 1 75 percent rate good for five years quite a deal but in fact that rate has been adjusted after three months
7357609 hopefully this is a warning to some degree to lenders in indiana that we want them to be fair with indiana consumers
7357610 these are people that were told if you sell your home youre not going to have to pay a prepayment penalty
7357611 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7357612 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7357613 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7357614 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7357615 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7357616 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7357617 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7357618 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7357619 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7357620 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7357621 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7357622 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7357623 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7357624 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7357625 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7357626 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7357627 j sus fils de marie se peut il que ton seigneur fasse descendre sur nous du ciel une table servie

7357630 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7357631 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7357632 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7357633 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7357634 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7357635 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7357636 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7357637 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7357638 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7357639 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7357640 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7357641 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7357642 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7357643 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7357644 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7357645 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7357646 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7357647 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7357648 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7357649 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7357650 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7357651 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7357652 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7357653 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7357654 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7357655 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7357656 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7357657 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7357658 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7357659 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7357660 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7357661 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7357662 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7357663 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7357664 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7357665 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7357666 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7357667 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7357668 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7357669 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7357670 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7357671 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7357672 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7357673 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7357674 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7357675 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7357676 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7357677 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7357678 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7357679 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7357680 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7357681 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7357682 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7357683 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7357684 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7357685 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7357686 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7357687 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7357688 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7357689 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7357690 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7357691 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7357692 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7357693 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7357694 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7357695 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7357696 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7357697 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7357698 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7357699 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7357700 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7357701 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7357702 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7357703 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7357704 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7357705 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7357706 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7357707 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7357708 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7357709 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7357710 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7357711 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7357712 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7357713 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7357714 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7357715 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7357716 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7357717 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7357718 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7357719 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7357720 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7357721 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7357722 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7357723 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7357724 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7357725 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7357726 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7357727 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7357728 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7357729 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7357730 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7357731 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7357732 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7357733 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7357734 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7357735 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
7357736 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7357737 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7357738 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else

7357744 the most intangible legacy is that throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7357745 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7357746 london will be constrained in that they will have an actual budget and cant haul in a thousand workers from the countryside force them to build buildings and then send them back again
7357747 but there will be no attempt by london to say were more spectacular they can do fun they can do humor they can have a party for the world instead of a sober isolated olympic zone apart from the city which is what we have here
7357748 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge that the situation was a major change in comparison to before the games so we believe the games had a good influence in that
7357749 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come true
7357750 we have inquired of the authorities who said the protests and the inquiries of the citizens have been met in mutual agreement that is my reply
7357751 the reply we received from the chinese authorities was that this was an application of chinese law the ioc is not a sovereign organization we have to respect chinese law

7357759 a womans mind should always be filled with a life plan else she is in danger a busy woman is generally a safe woman
7357760 she must find her life work and keep busy even a hobby is better than nothing if time hangs on her hands she should do something with all her might and not delay for time is flying a colored woman especially should have some purpose in her life to further race advancement it should not only be a high purpose but it should be something real
7357761 the two attractive periods in a womans life are girlhood and maturity if girlhood is not sufficiently attractive a girl may go into beauty training for maturity the fair fat and forty age is no longer dreaded
7357762 no one should ever scorn a colored working woman she has been the bone and sinew of the race she has built the churches helped the schools and has made the race what it is the pioneer colored woman in most instances has helped make the wealth that many colored families enjoy today
7357763 colored people are credited with having the finest teeth in the world the obligation of this gift is cleanliness and preservation of this attractive gift
7357764 a radical racist group one of the most anti american groups in the country which has permeated u s campuses since the 1960s and continues its push to carve a racist nation out of the american west
7357765 the organizations very nomenclature the national council of la raza is hate speech to the core despite all the contortions of the group raza as its latin cognate suggests reflects the meaning of race in spanish not the people and thats precisely why we dont hear of something like the national council of the people which would not confer the buzz notion of ethnic racial and tribal chauvinism
7357766 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7357767 if the russians have it it needs to be returned immediately
7357768 i just want to say that i was i was running from georgian troops bombing our city not russian troops i want to say thank you to the russian troops that were helping us out

7357770 the torturer has become like the pirate and the slave trader before him an enemy of all mankind
7357771 a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency
7357772 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7357773 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber

7357793 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7357794 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7357795 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7357796 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7357797 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7357798 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7357799 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7357800 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7357801 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7357802 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7357803 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7357804 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7357805 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives

7357812 our three telephones were calling incessantly people were crying could not speak yelled at us demanding to know how we allowed such a tragedy there were children there young sportsmen and their parents grief was overwhelming
7357813 people were kissing what remained of their loved ones even we who should be used to anything could not look at this and turned away not to begin crying too

7357817 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7357818 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7357819 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7357820 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7357821 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7357822 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7357823 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7357824 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7357825 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7357826 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7357827 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7357828 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7357829 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7357830 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7357831 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7357832 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7357833 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7357834 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7357835 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7357836 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7357837 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7357838 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7357839 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7357840 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7357841 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

7357847 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7357848 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7357849 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7357850 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7357851 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7357852 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7357853 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7357854 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7357855 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7357856 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7357857 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7357858 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7357859 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7357860 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7357861 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7357862 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7357863 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7357864 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7357865 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7357866 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7357867 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7357868 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7357869 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7357870 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7357871 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7357872 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7357873 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7357874 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7357875 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint

7357882 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7357883 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7357884 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7357885 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7357886 i was very disappointed that the mask was not in the show i would advise anyone to visit the british museum instead its egyptian collection is massive and free to view
7357887 it has a marvellous sarcophagus of the pharaoh seti i who reigned in the period after tutankhamuns death
7357888 the biggest collections are in the british museum and the v amp a
7357889 i love to spend an afternoon there because it has a mix of things that give a feel for daily life
7357890 it has this dim holy atmosphere and really does bring byzantium to life
7357891 most striking are holbeins the ambassadors and van eycks arnolfini portrait
7357892 for example there is a cartoon or initial drawing of henry viii by hans holbein the younger which is the prototype for the famous portraits of him that people are familiar with elsewhere the ashmolean museum in oxford has some striking works my favourite is a portrait by alessandro allori of a young man holding an ancient cameo
7357893 all credit must be given to the shows curator emily sargent who has managed if not the impossible then the extremely tricky a show that probes the most intimate recesses of human existence but refrains from crass voyeurism however decrepit these remains may be there is still a strong sense that they were once living emoting people
7357894 dense hallucinatory improvisations that subvert the apparent innocence of the original illustrations they are rich in art historical allusions from medieval images of hell and damnation to picasso surrealism abstract expressionism and paul mccarthys assaults on icons of folk culture
7357895 and undeserving of such attention unless we all are i think we all are
7357896 the colts have gotten a really good deal but then they would have to
7357897 so like debra is the branch chief right now you cant give her gifts
7357898 whatever happened to crazy horse i cant find it anywhere that shit fucked you up
7357899 african american and hispanic men groups that purchase most of the malt liquor consumed in the united states
7357900 he crazy horse gave his life protecting the lakota people and culture from the greed of the land grabbers gold seekers and liquor dealers over a century ago
7357901 merely taken something from the public domain and turned it into something of value whatever symbolic value the name had was due to their own authorship of the trademark
7357902 the image of these two italian american entrepreneurs leading horses across the plains to show homage due to an indian ancestral spirit is certainly more striking than the accompanying claim for punitive damages
7357903 i stood at the doctors side and watched him perform a partial birth abortion on a woman who was six months pregnant
7357904 the power of most of edwardss sermons insists marsden was their logic logic we might add sovereignty set ablaze by the spirit of power
7357905 it is important to note not only that edwards constantly points to christ in his preaching but also that he provides what must rank as some of the loveliest detailed descriptions of christ in the while range of homiletical literature
7357906 if you find me short in things impute that to my love of brevity if you find me besides the truth in anything impute that to my infirmity but if you find anything here that serves to your furtherance and joy of the faith impute that to the mercy of god bestowed on you and me yours to serve you with what little i have
7357907 the prince must none the less make himself feared in such a way that if he is not loved at least he escapes being hated for fear is quite compatible with an absence of hatred and the prince can avoid hatred if he abstains from the property of his subjects and citizens and from their women
7357908 all in all its just another brick in the wall
7357909 you always want to save money as much as you can
7357910 its actually gone up probably about 100 dollars in the last three months four month it was averaging around 80 90 dollars
7357911 we spent quite a few dollars on blinds could have paid a couple electric bills with that money
7357912 your fiberglass insulation or any other type of conventional insulation is not doing its job it works to a certain extent but this radiant heat is getting through with great ease
7357913 this is a critical time for everyone to do their part to conserve water
7357914 all of us are the trustees of our environment and we must take every step possible to conserve water for the sake of our community
7357915 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy

7357919 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7357920 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7357921 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7357922 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7357923 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7357924 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7357925 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7357926 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7357927 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7357928 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7357929 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7357930 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7357931 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7357932 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7357933 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7357934 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7357935 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7357936 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7357937 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7357938 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

7357945 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7357946 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7357947 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7357948 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7357949 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7357950 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama

7357969 yeah ones from chicago ones from delaware but in terms of being pragmatic progressive in the way that western progressive have historically been their positions align much better with the west than mccain does
7357970 i remind people that mccain may be the senator from arizona but hes really not of arizona hes really of washington d c
7357971 the connection of sen obama and sen biden to the issues we care about
7357972 john mccain has represented the west for over two decades he understands western issues

7357989 the violence in american cities has a direct cause and effect related to what is taking place in mexico
7357990 the farther north you go from the border the less that is understood
7357991 we have seen an increasing amount of these types of violent crimes in the past five months
7357992 we want the public to realize that these types of crimes will not be tolerated in phoenix
7357993 this phenomenon is a growing threat to the national security and sovereignty of the us the hundreds of billions of dollars caught up as windfall profit for arab islamic oil barons is soon to be used to buy distressed and foreclosed property from the very americans that the run up in oil has exploited

7357998 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7357999 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden

7358016 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7358017 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7358018 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama

7358028 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7358029 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7358030 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else

7358033 were in the middle of a protracted teachers strike and under the cover of the olympic games we saw the government increase teachers registration fees from 180 to 270
7358034 its another blow for teachers and this will raise 3 2 million annually out of the pockets of teachers
7358035 the board itself is broadly representative of parents and education workers and a whole range of interests so its not anything to do with the current wage dispute with the teachers

7358058 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
7358059 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
7358060 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out

7358078 in february the florida department of education modified its standards to explicitly require for the first time the states public schools to teach evolution calling it

7358083 moller sky car m400 but its expected to be released to private investors by 2012 the main reason we do not have these mainstream is due to the lack of funding being put towards these things
7358084 credit cards are used for paying all bills each time you buy something the card s number is fed into the store s computer station a master computer then deducts the charge from your bank balance
7358085 gender roles were something that no sci fi writer or futurist of the era seemed to think would change
7358086 a typical vacation in 2008 is to spend a week at an undersea resort where your hotel room window looks out on a tropical underwater reef a sunken ship or an ancient excavated city available to guests are two and three person submarines in which you can cruise well marked underwater trails
7358087 you simply press a combination of buttons and the pages flash on your home screen the world s information is available to you almost instantaneously

7358096 it is a sad thing we no longer predict greater future for ourselves
7358097 even though there are practicle things that can be done no one really adresses problems like global warming aids world hunger energy needs yeah people pay lip service to these problems but they don t tell you they are solveable or even managable

7358109 het toont aan dat onze agenda nooit zo gevuld is als we wel denken en dat er als we echt willen nog altijd wel wat tijd is voor meer afspraken en meer activiteiten
7358110 daarover gaat het niet de grote waarheid die in dit experiment schuilt is de volgende als je niet eerst de grote stenen in de pot doet krijg je ze er achteraf nooit meer in
7358111 nadat ik je had geslagen schreef je in het zand en nu schrijf je op een steen waarom
7358112 als iemand ons pijn doet moeten we het in zand opschrijven waar de wind van vergeving het kan uitwissen maar als iemand iets goeds doet voor ons moeten we het in steen graveren waar geen wind het ooit kan uitwissen
7358113 het is soms eenvoudiger ellende zonder einde te zien dan het eind van de ellende

7358125 i thought that mccain did a great job of answering the question about his first marriage he did not back down from it and was direct in his response this american does not need to hear the sordid details of that failed first marriage

7358134 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
7358135 the behavior of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behavior
7358136 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
7358137 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
7358138 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control center
7358139 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
7358140 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
7358141 we believe that cross fertilization of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas
7358142 how dare you debbie gray even mention such minor little dittys when someone so young so beautiful and so innocent as lily is struggling just to stay alive while being tortured through chemotherapy and radiation at the same time

7358156 nanotechnology promises a fundamental improvement in the way we build our products we believe that nanotechnology will allow us to insert more capability into a smaller space with lower weight and potentially lower cost and at the same time achieve greater reliability
7358157 new coatings will provide high performance low observables for enhanced stealth of our aircraft and missiles making it more difficult for our systems to be detected by enemy forces smaller components such as miniaturised electronics will allow increased redundancy in systems that will result in greater reliability

7358159 oh im just a marketer i dont understand that tv stuff
7358160 first we eased monetary policy substantially particularly after indications of economic weakness proliferated around the turn of the year in easing rapidly and proactively we sought to offset at least in part the tightening of credit conditions associated with the crisis and thus to mitigate the effects on the broader economy
7358161 the second element of our response has been to offer liquidity support to the financial markets through a variety of collateralized lending programs i have discussed these lending facilities and their rationale in some detail on other occasions briefly these programs are intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to deleverage in a more orderly manner
7358162 the third element of our strategy encompasses a range of activities and initiatives undertaken in our role as financial regulator and supervisor some of which i will describe in more detail later in my remarks briefly these activities include cooperating with other regulators to monitor the health of individual financial institutions working with the private sector to reduce risks in some key markets developing new regulations including new rules to govern mortgage and credit card lending taking an active part in domestic and international efforts to draw out the lessons of the recent experience and applying those lessons in our supervisory practices
7358163 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
7358164 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
7358165 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
7358166 the military presence in tibet is old but the frenzy of new construction in the amdo and kham regions makes me say that this colonisation by the army is designed to last
7358167 most of our players are caught in the middle of high school exams and we relied on call ups from our youth academy to fill some gaps this past week and are extremely happy with the effort
7358168 our games versus fc xtreme and penticton were competitive battles and the results worthy for both teams
7358169 all five goals conceded this weekend could have been avoided by simple clearances from the back line
7358170 we settled and played well today and should have come away with points its a learning process for our young team of 16 and 17 year olds were moving in the right direction
7358171 god whispers in our pleasures and he shouts in our pain
7358172 god heres what i need to hear from you about today
7358173 eye will git to thu bottum of this and call ewe back
7358174 its just another pta program another night i have to be out
7358175 we are comforted by god in the midst of our suffering in order that we may be able to comfort others with the same comfort with which we have received

7358278 thus it is still possible to envision a scenario under which the financial system avoids a sharp contraction in the supply of credit although this is significantly less likely now that it was as recently as may
7358279 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they will take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers preserve price stability while supporting growth and continue injecting liquidity as needed by an industry that is still far from having resolved its problems at a time of strong inflationary pressures and tightening credit conditions

7358363 although the banks are large diversified businesses they are not immune to the major forces affecting the economy and their customers the outlook for the rest of the year and 2009 has to be cautious as there are few signs as yet that wholesale funding and securitisation will return in the immediate future

7358381 for the first time hmrc will have powers to access records before returns are filed turn up unannounced to check the records and routinely have access to business premises and assets
7358382 the revenue has been given new powers and we can assume they intend to use them
7358383 schedule 36 is only 25 pages in length but many of its provisions are controversial and arguably give hmrc much greater powers than those it enjoys under current rules
7358384 further safeguards are then planned in guidance and codes of practice on which hmrc will consult
7358385 this is an example of where we have listened carefully to stakeholders throughout the process the review of powers is a careful process it takes between one and two years to develop each proposal working throughout with business and the professions we have responded to concerns throughout making changes where a clear case to do so was made this approach has been praised by key stakeholders
7358386 schedule 36 was seen as pretty controversial in principle but exactly how worried taxpayers should be depends on how hmrc implements its powers
7358387 we are advising finance directors to have a raids policy in place
7358388 the revenue is unlikely to use these powers on a huge multinational where it could take months to get round one site it is likely to choose companies it can manage

7358399 there is a moral insensitivity on the part of the powers that be and that is why they havent done something they should have
7358400 the media conveyed the impression that many women of the women with three or four kids are already going to work and being responsible
7358401 but that is not true most of these women have never been socialized to the workplace
7358402 they took sin and coupled in with a financial benefit
7358403 fear that freedom in the west means moral corruption and liberals are the ones who are proving them right
7358404 the us is viewed as establishing and official posture of state hostility to religion

7358406 religious ideologue s who chose terrorism to accomplish their goals
7358407 bin laden seeks to stop the war on terror and the left too consistently demeans our foreign policy efforts without solid reason other ideas or consideration of potential consequences

7358423 as a black man barack can get shot going to the gas station
7358424 sen barack obamas wife and three close advisers have been involved with a program at the university of chicago medical center that steers patients who dont have private insurance primarily poor black people to other health care facilities
7358425 some participants view the word urban as code for black
7358426 i think own two houses in knoxville tennessee im not certain there are so many trees and so many houses i wish people wouldnt make so much of it if i cant remember how many i own i cant be expected to remember everything im a wren
7358427 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make more than one nest and if you dont know how many nests you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7358428 but if youre like me and youve got one nest or if you were like the millions of birds who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgages so they dont lose their nests you might have a different perspective
7358429 lets not exaggerate our self worth the point is that birds of whatever feather should not attempt to make other birds feels badly about their earnings we live in the same woods we share the same fields and their butterflies and ladybugs we need in live in harmony

7358432 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
7358433 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
7358434 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
7358435 companies should start measuring their energy use in january 2009 which will allow for a more accurate forecasting
7358436 energy use fluctuates and the time frame given does not take into account that companies are likely to use more energy in winter and less in summer
7358437 curfew will not be lifted for 2 3 days and no one will be allowed to march towards lal chowk on monday

7358441 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7358442 the government has used the olympics to display its organizing strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7358443 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7358444 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7358445 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7358446 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7358447 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power
7358448 sports are just sports but this success will intensify foreign fears that china is becoming a successful authoritarian government confident in itself that can chart its own course
7358449 you train your whole life and you want to win
7358450 in the bigger picture i havent thought about it yet it hasnt sunk in give it some time
7358451 in about a month well look back and hope this isnt the last time but for right now it seems it is
7358452 leading into beijing everyone was talking about the politics but i think once people got here they really focused on the sports
7358453 that is president hu jintaos style just let things go on
7358454 these games needed to go well to help china feel confident internationally the leaders will be thrilled
7358455 nobodys died nobodys been collapsing because of the air and the people who turned up in the airport with masks on they just looked stupid
7358456 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
7358457 china was authoritarian on the way into the games and it will be authoritarian on the way out
7358458 when people asked me have you ever been on a horse i said no have you ever fenced no have you ever shot no they were like good luck

7358461 land is no more the topic for kashmiris now they are focused on the main issue of right to self determination
7358462 whatever the people are doing is the manifestation of their anger against the government of india
7358463 we do not believe that any of the lost laptops contained sensitive or classified information
7358464 this is another example of this governments woeful failure when it comes to data security
7358465 given the sensitivity of the home offices work including its lead role in the fight against terrorism this is all the more worrying
7358466 this is of course also the government department with responsibility for id cards there now needs to be an urgent review of what data was lost on these laptops its sensitivity and possible impact on any work as well as a wider review of the home offices security policy
7358467 if the home office cannot safeguard such basic equipment how can they be trusted to deliver id cards containing the personal data of millions
7358468 the home office is determined to learn from earlier security breaches in government and is committed to ensuring that our systems and processes to protect personal data are as good as they can be

7358506 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours

7358508 were just going to take our time taking people down nice and easy
7358509 return of 400 acres of land acquired from unwilling farmers
7358510 this land measures roughly 500 acres this is not private land but some cpm backed promoters have occupied it if the government agrees we will help them get the land from the panchayat controlled by trinamool singur can bring together industry and agriculture but 400 acres at the singur site have to be returned the government should not turn this into an ego issue we have no problems if the factory comes up there
7358511 we have not come here to break down the boundary wall otherwise we would have come with hammers we dont want any disruption here our only demand is that the government return the land
7358512 they can go if they want to who is stopping them

7358533 then not 1 maybe 2 laps at the most later more reliability issues with the f2008
7358534 it would all prove academic anyway for the unhappy raikkonen as the ferrari engine failed in dramatic style a few minutes later as he crossed the start finish line given these engine designs are frozen it is strange that ferrari have suddenly found reliability issues

7358538 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7358539 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7358540 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7358541 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7358542 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq news and expanding access to health care
7358543 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7358544 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7358545 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7358546 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq news and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7358547 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7358548 if we think renewables are going to solve our energy dependency thats an incredible mistake

7358565 die dtm ist nach der formel 1 eine der besten meisterschaften der welt jeder junge fahrer w rde gern in der dtm fahren man hat die unterst tzung gro er hersteller es ist eine sehr harte meisterschaft sie hat ein hohes niveau und es gibt einige klangvolle namen in der serie wenn man also die chance hat in der dtm zu fahren nutzt man sie ohne zu z gern
7358566 man kann ins fahrerlager man kann die fahrer sehen alles ist offen man kann den autos in der boxengasse zuschauen man kann in die boxen schauen und es ist eine tolle show die rennen sind immer eng es herrscht ein enger fight zwischen den herstellern die gesamte atmosph re an einem rennwochenende ist etwas besonderes
7358567 meiner meinung nach ist da ein gro er unterschied ich habe einige btcc rennen gesehen weil ich in einer rahmenserie gefahren bin die dtm hat viel mehr power es ist als ob man ein formel 3 auto f hrt es hat mehr downforce die ganze technologie im auto ist etwas ganz anderes die btcc autos basieren auf stra enfahrzeugen und wurden zum tourenwagen aufgetunt das ist ein gro er unterschied nehmen wir brands hatch als beispiel das ist ein sehr kurzer kurs aber wir sind pro runde trotzdem noch acht sekunden schneller als die btcc autos
7358568 jeder spricht ber paddock bend weil es eine blinde kurve ist sie ist sehr schnell und geht bergab und bergauf
7358569 es gibt zwar nur vier kurven und deshalb sollte es eigentlich eine einfache strecke sein aber ebenso wie der norisring ist sie technisch sehr anspruchsvoll und man kann dort sehr einfach zeit verlieren im vergangenen lagen alle 20 autos innerhalb von einer sekunde das ist unwahrscheinlich eng das sorgt f r spannende rennen in brands hatch
7358570 er ist in gro britannien ein absoluter superstar und er hat sich berhaupt nicht ver ndert er ist immer noch auf dem boden geblieben er ist sehr freundlich es ist toll dass seine erfolge ihn menschlich nicht ver ndert haben er ist immer noch der alte
7358571 denn meine heimat in schottland ist ber sieben stunden entfernt es ist nat rlich sch n dass es in meinem heimatland gro britannien ist aber ich w rde es jetzt nicht als mein heimrennen bezeichnen
7358572 ich lebe dort wirklich sehr gern es ist toll dass ich in mein auto steigen und zu den meisten rennstrecken fahren kann wenn ich pr termine in stuttgart habe setze ich mich einfach in mein auto und fahre hin fr her war ich dauernd in flugzeugen und an flugh fen weil ich berall hinfliegen musste das nervt irgendwann und man verliert auch viel zeit dadurch

7358578 we havent come to apply threats weve come to discuss and seek solutions
7358579 speaking as a son i know that a president shouldnt be treated like that its against common law because even terrorists and common prisoners can be visited by their family
7358580 i think the country will now unfortunately live through some difficult times

7358595 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
7358596 we have a condition that has no known cause and there is no cure and people are looking to us to provide them with answers
7358597 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
7358598 the parents feel like it is something that has happened to their children here
7358599 what were trying to do is find out if it is true that theres this alarming incidence
7358600 we dont have a blood test or a lab test to say you have autism so its somewhat subjective
7358601 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7358602 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7358603 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7358604 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world
7358605 but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7358606 thats what they did heres what we did which do you prefer
7358607 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
7358608 we have a condition that has no known cause and there is no cure and people are looking to us to provide them with answers
7358609 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
7358610 the parents feel like it is something that has happened to their children here
7358611 what were trying to do is find out if it is true that theres this alarming incidence
7358612 we dont have a blood test or a lab test to say you have autism so its somewhat subjective
7358613 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7358614 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7358615 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7358616 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world
7358617 but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7358618 i feel like im in a dreamland i really cant believe it
7358619 drew played very well today and he put the pressure back on me this afternoon but i just tried to hang in there and hit good shots
7358620 after i fell behind this morning i just tried to come out and make something happen and i felt like i did
7358621 but i guess i just caught him on the wrong day
7358622 it was kind of fun to watch what are you going to do
7358623 i cant wait to play in those major championships because i think that will be great experience for me

7358626 it is better to risk saving a guilty man than to condemn an innocent one
7358627 people have been led to believe they can get a 1 75 percent rate good for five years quite a deal but in fact that rate has been adjusted after three months

7358630 casino carpet is known as an exercise in deliberate bad taste that somehow encourages people to gamble
7358631 people always dont notice the rainbows in the carpet but they have a perception of good luck
7358632 you dont want a real plain carpet because people drop cigarettes on it and spill drinks on it
7358633 it is the same thing as putting canopies on tops of tables which has become popular that lowers the ceiling people dont look up at the spaciousness and concentrate more where the action is
7358634 the fact is at the places that have the most play the attention of the visitors are focused on the gaming equipment just like in a department store which frank winfield woolworth thought of in 1878
7358635 what would be the real issue here is gambling is a hyper experience nobody gambles to relax they gamble for the adrenalin rush therefore it is possible that a more exciting carpet pattern will create a more exciting atmosphere but nobody has ever demonstrated that
7358636 i am not arguing against it but i could not find the impact
7358637 but i emphasize that doesnt mean it is not there
7358638 note the regal tones of caesars palace the bountiful bouquet of mandalay place the soft almost abstract pointillism of paris all whispering gamble gamble just out of the range of consciousness as people walk to the nearest slot machine
7358639 you are trying to create an ambiance that is going to encourage people to stick around and play
7358640 so you cant treat carpets all by themselves they are part of the integrated pull
7358641 in that world it is not enough simply to provide games and play one has to understand as deeply as possible what play is and then build play grounds
7358642 you want to get that sense of vibrancy and energy with carpet that something is going on
7358643 the curve welcomes us and the oversharp angle rejects us the angle is masculine and the curve feminine the beloved curve has nest like powers it incites us to possession it is a curved corner inhabited geometry
7358644 the most enticing and alluring and stimulating casino spaces are those which make principal use of the curvilinear rather than the straight
7358645 many of the carpets use flowers and wheels both suggestive of a cyclical life flowers bud bloom and then die and their beauty is only ephemeral
7358646 the wheel was famous to the romans note its prominence at caesars palace as a symbol of the relentless capriciousness of fortune you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment

7358654 when the names were approved by council the da said people would damage them although they may not be responsible for the damage we will hold them responsible
7358655 we will set traps for the culprits and prosecute them the name changes should be respected if people cant accept it tough luck for them
7358656 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7358657 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7358658 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7358659 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7358660 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7358661 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7358662 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7358663 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7358664 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7358665 its very hectic especially with two and trying to get everything they need
7358666 just going through the list and buying the stuff they have to have
7358667 you expect more of a religious institution you expect more golden rule
7358668 this is private property you cant park here this is what you did its wrong isnt it
7358669 its very convenient other than having to cross the road where all the traffic is
7358670 i asked our church to be the neighbors we should be to be good neighbors and not to park in their parking lot because its a business and they have a responsibility to their customers
7358671 hopefully both of us will live by the golden rule both of us will give to falwell
7358672 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7358673 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7358674 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7358675 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7358676 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7358677 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7358678 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7358679 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7358680 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much
7358681 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
7358682 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
7358683 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
7358684 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces here and somebody else has had a shit there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
7358685 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
7358686 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
7358687 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
7358688 here the assumption is that everyone is a human being everyone has self respect help them to analyse their own situation and no one in the world will after that choose to continue eating each others shit

7358692 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7358693 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7358694 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7358695 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7358696 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7358697 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7358698 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7358699 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7358700 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7358701 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7358702 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7358703 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7358704 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7358705 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7358706 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7358707 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7358708 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7358709 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7358710 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7358711 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7358712 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7358713 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7358714 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7358715 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7358716 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7358717 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7358718 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7358719 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7358720 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7358721 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7358722 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7358723 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7358724 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7358725 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7358726 im never going on the cover of maxim at all
7358727 i only go along with what i am comfortable with
7358728 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7358729 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7358730 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7358731 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7358732 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7358733 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7358734 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7358735 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7358736 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7358737 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7358738 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7358739 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7358740 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7358741 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7358742 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7358743 who are open to doing something on the production side
7358744 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7358745 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7358746 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7358747 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7358748 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7358749 estamos dispuestos a que el pse apoye a basagoiti como candidato a lehendakari
7358750 estamos dispuestos a que el pse apoye a basagoiti como candidato a lehendakari
7358751 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7358752 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7358753 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7358754 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7358755 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7358756 lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have shown the work
7358757 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7358758 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7358759 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7358760 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7358761 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7358762 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7358763 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7358764 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7358765 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7358766 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7358767 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7358768 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7358769 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7358770 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7358771 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7358772 die globale lage ist sehr viel schlechter als noch vor einiger zeit gedacht
7358773 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7358774 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7358775 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7358776 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal

7358808 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7358809 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion
7358810 and who made you the creator of the english language
7358811 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7358812 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7358813 ahh johhny so full of arogance heres what god says about people like you rom 1 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
7358814 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7358815 ignore aks arguments havent ignored any theres just no challenge to them he apparently ran out of evo proof and had to attack the bible i think his head burst after the massive amount of replys that came in god will always call some one to defend his word i wont respond to the last comment i dont swing that way johhny
7358816 case in point coelacanth fish the great and mighty transitional fossil
7358817 heres a prediction for ya romans 1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
7358818 what a maroon that has already been done except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment the testing lab was not told in advance where the rock came from so they could not fake the results to agree with how old they thought the rock was choke on it
7358819 except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment
7358820 johnny johnny johnny the fossils for the coelacanth are 140 million years old whenfisrt discovered it was proclaimed a missing link that is until they were found alive 140 million years and 0 change thats a big0 nothing no evolutionary advancement what so ever you cant get over that you cant explain that away the only way you can is if the fossils werent found in 140 million year old dirt give it a rest already you failed
7358821 thats industry wide your mad your millions of years have sunk to the bottom there was no deceite in the test like i said call the company and complain a test is a test is a test why what would have happened if they told them where it was from shouldnt the results be the same are you saying theres 2 standards of testing johnny is there improbriaty in the lab
7358822 wait a minute thats pretty gratuitous heres a guy who spent five years in prison not knowing where his next meal was going to come from
7358823 they simply told us to get out of the car and started beating us with gun butts with sticks
7358824 i got injuries in my chest my lumbar and one of my assistants got a fracture in his arm then two police personnel watching nearby came to our rescue and took us to a nearby hospital
7358825 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
7358826 one of my real beliefs in this work is that in addition to adopting animals out and protecting animals from cruelty its important to have programs that bring people and animals together in meaningful ways
7358827 people are in my office all day when shes here
7358828 it has a calming effect i look forward to coming here every week and seeing the dogs
7358829 it keeps your mind off the crummy things in life
7358830 i was bad because i knew i was being deployed so i let him do anything he wanted
7358831 children with special needs will be able to relate to me better than a person whos whole
7358832 theyll see me and think hes got only one leg and he did it
7358833 it goes along with the therapy im doing its another challenge
7358834 and in some places we have waiting lists of eight to 10 people for a bed
7358835 if the economy wasnt this way i wouldve gotten a job in a short period of time and it wouldve stopped the progression of everything else that happened
7358836 were a very small operation and we have very limited funding
7358837 we have never had a may june july and august where we have not only every bed that we have in the state occupied but we have waiting lists
7358838 and in some places we have waiting lists of eight to 10 people for a bed a bed
7358839 by the number of applications were seeing the need is greater and we do attribute that to the fact that they have no money people are living in cars people are sleeping on couches and that gets old
7358840 this is the first summer ive spent where almost every day we are full
7358841 the only reason i have anything open today is i had a family relocate and two men moved out i guarantee by tomorrow itll be full again
7358842 its easy to bounce back when you have one thing go wrong
7358843 said spader who has never lived in a shelter until now
7358844 but then when you lose your job and then you lose shelter and then you lose transportation its very very difficult its a cycle you cant get a job if you cant get there but you cant get a car if you dont have a job
7358845 its much more difficult for individuals grappling with emotional programs to compete successfully in the economic arena
7358846 its harder for them to focus on issues of livelihood when they are depressed they cant sleep or theyre drinking too much
7358847 everywhere across the country people are dealing with veterans in crisis and we have to assume that this is going to eventually impact us here
7358848 we were a resource to veterans struggling with addiction because they could utilize our shelter while they were dealing with this
7358849 post implementation of the city councils requirements we will be required to bar them
7358850 its disgraceful that people who served their country come home to live on the streets
7358851 my fear is thats going to grow with the economy this way
7358852 right now there are not a whole lot of good employment opportunities out there
7358853 things are going all right im getting more adjusted to it now
7358854 we have seen an increased use of our ptsd resources by these veterans
7358855 the reality is its treatable and veterans can lead a very healthy life
7358856 these are just images that are going to stay with me for the rest of my life
7358857 i believe to this day i have the record with the longest sniper kill in afghanistan with the m 14 rifle
7358858 i couldnt believe it was just a kid when i saw what my round did to him
7358859 in all my dreams he just stops and looks at me and thats when the dreams over
7358860 he was terminated for a character issue not a medical issue
7358861 during that period of time many veterans will die many will be forced to sell their homes because they are too sick to work
7358862 if it hadnt been for these leaders in the service pushing this why it may have never happened
7358863 when i called clinton and said to him sir the secretary of the army has authorized a purple heart for you he says thank you
7358864 some of the guys with the hand controls were turning better times than drivers with all their limbs it was phenomenal
7358865 you picked a good course to ride with me on
7358866 i think im going to have to trade in my grand am when i get back home
7358867 you get much more of a feel for the hand controls
7358868 and you learn skills like looking ahead through corners and how to cope with emergencies better it gives you much more peace of mind
7358869 i really wished i would have been able to get my license sooner because once i did i was all about driving i wanted to soup the car up but i never had the chance
7358870 they were lighter than humvees and tougher than tanks and they could go anywhere
7358871 we were under the impression that these marines were all currently driving
7358872 some of the guys with the hand controls were turning better times than drivers with all their limbs
7358873 were going to have to deal with this for the rest of our lives
7358874 getting to go on trips like this helped me cope with anxiety and just talk to people something just clicked
7358875 gefallen hat w rden wir uns freuen wenn auch ihr unseren
7358876 one moment for there is nothing beside it that i consider to be life judging it by reason and just opinion
7358877 how is that explain it to me for you surely have apprised me the most stupendous news and novelty

7358890 le bonheur cest tout ce qui arrive entre deux emmerdements
7358891 there isnt a lot of solidarity here there isnt a lot of connectedness
7358892 the people have kind of been scared into not coming
7358893 the democrats now own this war and have funded it as much as the republicans
7358894 there are some people who dont want to alienate the democratic party because theyre our best hope
7358895 the democrats own the war in iraq as much as the republicans do at this point
7358896 nobodys putting their hopes in the republicans to stop the war but a lot of people are putting false hopes in the democrats
7358897 the violence issue could lead people to go to mccain or lead people not to vote for democrats
7358898 the challenge is will we be able to collectively rise to the occasion and move beyond our individual activities to deliver a collective statement
7358899 our goal is to have everything come off as peacefully and non violently as possible
7358900 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7358901 by bringing attractive yet functional sculptures to our streets we are elevating the profile of cycling and we believe that more and more people will begin to think about cycling as a mode of transportation and not just a mode of recreation
7358902 regular bike riders have an eagle eye for our current bike racks but these nine installations will capture the attention of all new yorkers
7358903 it was important to me that these new racks be the same thickness and material as the existing racks to help identify them as practical bike racks and not just modern art
7358904 the locations about as perfect as one could imagine wall street for the dollar sign and bergdorfs for the giant high heel
7358905 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7358906 doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother faith is an oasis in the heart which can never be reached by the caravan of thinking
7358907 are securing their self interest in every way they can
7358908 im profoundly humbled by the immense privilege ive been given today
7358909 im also intensely proud proud of the athletes who pulled in the best medal tally for decades proud of the people behind them whove delivered this stunning success and proud beyond all that london is now in charge of the olympic legacy
7358910 the next games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport
7358911 we will draw on that heritage and we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport
7358912 it was a little daunting picking up the flag but the baton has been passed to a london administration that will deliver
7358913 it has been an amazing atmosphere here and in london too
7358914 you can see how its going to build to 2012 nights like this make you proud to be british
7358915 when i left it was all recession recession recession and weve come back to a country overwhelmed by olympic success
7358916 theres an overwhelming sense of people being excited by the next olympics being in london
7358917 londons going to be crazy if we have support like this now its going to be amazing
7358918 this is my first trip to london and i am looking forward to coming back in four years to compete in the london olympics
7358919 its been an amazing few weeks winning eight gold medals was a dream come true
7358920 never mind valencia since we no longer have the nurburgring nor spa not to mention zandvoort nor brands arent all the circuits rubbish
7358921 it is not a v shaped recession where you enter and exit fast it looks more like a protracted u shaped recession
7358922 not only is the current slowdown likely to be protracted but with broader impact it can affect decision making on tech spending across verticals
7358923 primarily we cater to the government and the slowdown if any is unlikely to affect our projects that are either allotted to us or those that are already being executed
7358924 for every one rupee of work we complete we are adding a fresh project worth rs 1 25 this way the order book is only building and there is no sight of any slowdown as of now
7358925 water business is turning out to be company within a company for us most of our projects are related to water and we see a big business there
7358926 we are ready we have everything to offer for everybody right now we are executing a supervisory control and data acquisition project for the authorities in hyderabad this is based on technology and helps the civic body to monitor the water drawing by every customer we are also participating in some of the biggest irrigation projects in the country
7358927 the trend in oil is basically down only if crude breaks the 114 per barrel mark then the next level to look out for would be 100 the outlook from hereon looks positive
7358928 we might see some pressure in the q1 and q2 numbers but markets are looking beyond that the commodity cool off is proffering some positive triggers for the market
7358929 this will likely limit the extent to which the market can continue to move up especially if consensus earnings estimates come down as we expect given the overly optimistic margin assumptions
7358930 we had cheers girls from ukraine and mumbai as in cricket they were called here to entertain the public so that they did not get bored
7358931 whats wrong if foreigners are dancing they are like our radha of olden days
7358932 cheer girls at such an auspicious and religious function is highly condemnable i will enquire into the matter
7358933 retirement is a time when you dont work for money its the time when money should start working for you
7358934 how long will you work under police protection after all you will have to come to singur railway station and then you will face the consequences
7358935 are not you ashamed of working for a project which is ruining the life of farmers you will have to pay heavily for it
7358936 after the tata project started coming up price of land adjacent to the project has increased manifold so owners of the disputed 400 acres will not continue cultivation but rather sell to local land sharks and brokers who are now at the forefront of the singur movement
7358937 yes we are willing to go along with cosmetic changes alteration in wording but nothing more
7358938 a periodic review brings with it several problems no country will be willing to invest billions of dollars for the next fifty years or so with a damcolese sword hanging on its head a project may have to be stopped half way through if even one member of the nsg suddenly decides that india has not fulfilled its non proliferation commitment we cant let down the countrys future by agreeing to such terms
7358939 only those who do not know how the system works believed that the waiver would be obtained in the first meeting the important meeting is the one ahead and i am confident india will get what it is looking for
7358940 jobs are difficult to come by in this market and for someone who has got a pink slip the scene is worse
7358941 there are other hungers hungers i dont even understand that are foreign to me
7358942 damn jay these chicks are supposed to already know this shit
7358943 el gran jefe blanco de washington ha ordenado hacernos saber que nos quiere comprar las tierras
7358944 ma dai tanto per stare un p in compagnia fuori di casa
7358945 vielleicht habe ich ein imageproblem wenn ein anderer spieler so etwas macht wird weitergespielt es kann sein dass ich unter besonderer beobachtung stehe

7358950 canta nos poeta aqueles versos feitos quela linda dama que morreu
7358951 just fuckin put the camera down and take it outta the bar nobody wants to be on fuckin camera in here
7358952 hey we dont like you no one does go away
7358953 wir waren die bessere mannschaft und hatten schalke im griff aber wir sind selbst schuld weil wir so viele klare chancen ausgelassen haben
7358954 wenn ich fit bin werde ich besser spielen ich bin sicher das werder meister werden kann
7358955 er ist in seiner konstanz und pr zision einzigartig hut ab
7358956 eine katastrophe wenn man mit einem auto auf platz 9 kommt dass schnell genug f r platz 3 ist eines meiner schlimmsten rennen
7358957 mit dieser mannschaft werden wir auch die 1 liga aufmischen
7358958 ich hatte todesangst niemand konnte ausschlie en dass meinem baby etwas ernsthaftes passiert ist erst als die kleine zur welt kam war klar dass sie gesund ist ich bin so gl cklich
7358959 matos trainer kam bei der siegerehrung pl tzlich auf mich zu und stellte sich ganz nah vor mich
7358960 pl tzlich sah ich aus dem augenwinkel wie matos auf mich zusprang ich bin selbst k mpfer deshalb habe ich instinktiv einen ausweichschritt nach hinten gemacht und habe nicht die gesamte wucht des tritts abbekommen so eine aktion habe ich noch nie erlebt ich war so stolz dass ich bei olympia dabei sein durfte und dann darf ich sogar noch das halbfinale leiten ich lasse mir die sch nen erinnerungen von so einem schlimmen zwischenfall aber nicht verderben nur ein schlechter verlierer benimmt sich so wie matos
7358961 es ist wichtig dass wir nicht mit einer niederlage nach madrid fliegen guter gegner hei e kulisse ich freue mich richtig auf mittwoch
7358962 schalke hat mich f r diese situation geholt nun ziehe ich mein ding durch ich will nicht die nummer 1 werden ich will beweisen dass die truppe sich auf mich verlassen kann
7358963 wir f hren 1 0 gegen atletico so wie wir in bremen aufgetreten und zur ckgekommen sind hat madrid respekt vor uns
7358964 wir waren berhaupt nicht pr sent und nicht aggressiv wir sind fast nur hinterhergelaufen und haben die torchancen nicht genutzt
7358965 damit wurde c ster nach einem hexenschuss der r cken massiert ich war gutgl ubig der meinung dass die verwendung keine unerlaubte medikation darstellt
7358966 ich werde den fei bescheid beim internationalen sportgerichtshof cas anfechten
7358967 wir haben zum schluss alles gemixt was noch da war wir haben das deutsche haus zerlegt es war die beste party die das deutsche haus seit 16 jahren erlebt hat
7358968 der schubst zieht und zerrt das ganze spiel l sst sich st ndig fallen unfassbar wie viel freist sse er daf r noch kriegt
7358969 ein witz das war doch nie und nimmer ein elfer nicht einmal in der b jugend wird so etwas gepfiffen
7358970 unsere j ngsten waren die besten sie haben ihre aufgaben weitestgehend fehlerfrei gel st
7358971 namhafte gegenspieler wie toni oder klose motivieren mich ganz besonders weil ich auch mal so ber hmt sein will wie sie
7358972 kimi ist im total tief ein bl der fehler rot hei t stehen gelb fertigmachen und gr n fahren
7358973 kimis arbeitsweise gleichg ltigkeit und interesselosigkeit ist nur zu tolerieren solange alles l uft kimi hat eine schwere zeit bei ferrari vor sich
7358974 nicht mal einstein k nnte erkl ren warum ich nicht gespielt habe
7358975 wahrscheinlich k nnte nicht mal albert einstein erkl ren warum ich nicht gespielt habe das hat mich sehr ge rgert und es gibt keine erkl rung daf r egal was jemand sagt
7358976 gegen bielefeld mussten wir von dreier auf eine vierer abwehrkette umstellen steve von bergen und kaka haben in der vorbereitung stark in der zentrale gespielt und joe hat noch trainingsr ckstand
7358977 konditionell bin ich noch nicht so weit ist wie es sein sollte
7358978 ich z hle auf joe ich bin ja nicht dumm es war nur ein spiel
7358979 nein kaka hat in frankfurt ein super spiel gemacht der fehler tut mir genau so weh das wichtigste ist dass hertha erfolg hat
7358980 es kann sein dass in dieser woche noch was in sachen transfer passiert
7358981 uns fehlte gegen den ksc die kreativit t im mittelfeld einer mit bersicht der den t dlichen pass spielen kann und super bei standard situationen ist im moment m ssen das jarolim und trochowski auffangen
7358982 ich habe die h nde von keeper miller gesehen ich dachte er trifft mich aber er hat mich nicht ber hrt
7358983 beyond a shadow of a doubt aspartame triggers brain tumors
7358984 therefore by allowing aspartame to be placed on the market the fda has violated the delaney amendment which forbids putting anything in food that is know to cause cancer and if the fda itself elects to violates its own the law who is left to protect the health of the public
7358985 happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own actions
7358986 you know who pays for your toys and fancy clothes
7358987 he just came out initially and just assassinated them that fast
7358988 every other country has the same problems we have the one problem they didnt have is our gun problem a robbery with a knife or a baseball bat somebody might have been injured a robbery with a gun somebodys killed
7358989 at 18 sabendo que ia ver no m nimo um seio nu provavelmente da martinne carole
7358990 first are you folks going to tell me that there wouldnt be a loss less deaths in iraq if guns were outlawed i wish we werent there and it is an illegal and immoral war if you dont beleive me as cindy sheehan she should know anyway since were there the least we could do would be to implement some strict gun control measures so that people would stop getting shot weve exported our gun culture to the middle east and dont tell me that it wasnt us because it was
7358991 i love how gun control conservatives love to throw facts around fact here fact there statistics here statistics there sheesh give it a rest

7358995 nein nein es geht schon wieder die platzwunde ber der rechten augenbraue wurde mit sechs stichen gen ht ich war sogar schon wieder im kraftraum
7358996 das wird sich herausstellen leider wurde ein weiteres vorbereitungsspiel gegen frankfurt abgesagt und ersatz bekamen wir nicht aber auch so versuchen wir alles zu probieren und herauszuholen auch die pokalspiele gegen die zweitligisten k nnen uns da weiterbringen
7358997 das musste ich zur kenntnis nehmen und entsprechend die sturmreihen anders aufstellen das passierte ja relativ fr h so dass ich sofort reagieren konnte
7358998 zumindest die beiden ersten sturmreihen sind klar da spielen courchaine collins und reimer sowie ramsay reid und joseph
7358999 also meisterschafts favorit sind wir nicht da ist die mannschaft mit ihrem durchschnittsalter von nur 25 4 jahren zu jung ich sehe berlin mannheim k ln hamburg vorn
7359000 unsere st rke ist die schnelligkeit auch technisch sind wir recht gut spielerisch haben wir noch einige luft nach oben
7359001 det fanns inte en arabisk by som inte tidigare hade en judisk befolkning
7359002 vilken 20 ring kan med vertygelse s ga till sig sj lv jag vet vad jag kommer att jobba med n r jag fyllt 25
7359003 det blir mindre vanligt att man stannar vid en arbetsplats
7359004 st ndigt p att vi ska anpassa oss till en allt mer f r nderlig v rld
7359005 alla ungdomar vill inte bli akademiker alla elever kan inte bli akademiker samh llet fungerar inte om alla blir akademiker
7359006 borde inte st ngda d rrar f r fortsatta h gskole och universitetsstudier tminstone beskrivas som omodernt
7359007 gabi und ich lieben uns seit vielen jahren jetzt haben wir schluss gemacht
7359008 gibts nicht unsere fans haben ein recht die spieler zu sehen
7359009 diesmal f lle ich valuev ich gewinne durch k o den ersten wm kampf habe ich auch in berlin gewonnen nur valuev wurde zum sieger erkl rt den titel werde ich meinen drei kindern john jocelyn und joaquin widmen
7359010 wir haben wie valuev den trainer gewechselt f r den gefeuerten norman stone der sich noch nach dem kampf 2005 im berliner ring pr gelte ist jetzt manny siaca in der ecke ein klasse man er hat schon siebenundzwanzig weltmeister gecoacht john wird sein achtundzwanzigster und dann steigt in berlin eine gro e wm party

7359055 we are very selective in taking up new projects and do not feel that the company has entered the market very late the real estate market in dubai has been booming we are bullish and believe that it will remain strong and healthy at least for the short to medium term based on our assessment
7359056 people who are waiting for this and sitting on the sidelines are actually missing a lot of opportunity the market is healthy both in terms of the real estate developers who are looking at exactly what they want to develop as well as the end users becoming smarter in selecting projects and are looking at the reputation of the developers they are becoming more selective in terms of acquiring assets and are making sure they know that they are buying from the right people
7359057 the idea behind this is to maintain the companys target and to take into account the inflation rising costs of building materials etc which we are seeing currently happening in the country
7359058 our idea of releasing stock for sale on an incremental basis will allow us to accommodate these potential increases at a later stage when we sell them this will not only give us more room to adjust the price spikes but will also allow us to maintain our sales growth

7359132 the victimisation and demonisation of muslims in the guise of investigation of terror offences is having a very serious psychological impact on the minds of not only the families of the victims but also other members of the community
7359133 the testimonies show widespread communalisation of the police across states in the country
7359134 the testimonies showed that large numbers of innocent young muslims have been and are being victimised by the police on the charge of being involved in various terrorist acts across the country this is particularly so in maharashtra gujarat madhya pradesh andhra pradesh and rajasthan though not limited to these states
7359135 the states ruled by both the bjp as well as the congress were witnessing such incidents
7359136 in most of these cases the courts are routinely allowing police remand and not granting bail merely on the statement that they are required for further investigations they do not examine whether there is any evidence against the accused
7359137 unfortunately the media too uncritically publicises the charges and allegations levelled by the police this has resulted in destruction of the lives and reputations of a large number of persons so picked up by the police who have later been found to be innocent
7359138 whenever any person is released by the police for the want of evidence against him the courts should award adequate compensation for the destruction of his life and reputation
7359139 in such cases the courts should examine if the prosecution was malafide and if it is so found the police officials involved must be held accountable and the compensation payable to the victims must recovered from the officers concerned
7359140 such officials of bar associations should be hauled up for contempt of court for interfering with administration of justice

7359191 now concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you brothers
7359192 the coming of the lord and our being gathered to him
7359193 in the verses 2 1 7 leading up to 2 8 one must read carefully as to what paul is saying the thessalonian church thought they might be in the tribulation the day of the lord because of the suffering they were undergoing but paul makes it clear that this was not so
7359194 also what smashes their deficient view is the fact that the

7359240 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7359241 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7359242 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7359243 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time

7359251 the journalists were reported to have been returning from the afgoye idp internally displaced people area and men with firearms ordered the journalists to leave with them
7359252 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7359253 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7359254 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7359255 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7359256 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7359257 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7359258 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7359259 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7359260 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7359261 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7359262 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7359263 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7359264 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7359265 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7359266 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7359267 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7359268 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7359269 i would go to the ends of the earth to find
7359270 i am specializing in such a unique field of organic organic organic it is a most difficult challenge
7359271 we must treat more flowers with something other than water and find this plant based organic solvent that is the biggest challenge

7359302 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7359303 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7359304 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7359305 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7359306 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7359307 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7359308 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7359309 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7359310 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7359311 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7359312 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7359313 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7359314 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7359315 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7359316 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7359317 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7359318 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7359319 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7359320 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7359321 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top celebrity icon however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers
7359322 im the healthiest ive been all my life my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
7359323 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7359324 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7359325 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7359326 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7359327 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7359328 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7359329 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7359330 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7359331 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7359332 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7359333 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7359334 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7359335 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7359336 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7359337 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7359338 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7359339 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7359340 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7359341 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7359342 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7359343 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7359344 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7359345 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7359346 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7359347 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7359348 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7359349 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7359350 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7359351 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7359352 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7359353 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7359354 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7359355 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7359356 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7359357 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7359358 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7359359 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7359360 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7359361 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7359362 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7359363 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7359364 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7359365 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7359366 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7359367 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7359368 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7359369 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7359370 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7359371 if a player did not want to play for me i know what id do
7359372 i would drive him to wherever he wanted to go myself just to get rid of him
7359373 im hardly going to break any goalscoring records am i
7359374 middlesbrough performed well it was a great strike from mido and to be honest i couldnt see us scoring
7359375 but we have done it so many times at anfield when all of a sudden something just happens in the last 10 minutes and the kop sucks a goal in
7359376 we have been doing it since the days of shankly and it is something liverpool will always continue to do
7359377 we havent clicked yet there is no hiding from that
7359378 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites
7359379 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7359380 this is the second time ive come here as a coach and the second time ive left as a loser
7359381 come heineken cup time i just hope i dont make it a hat trick
7359382 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7359383 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7359384 the lads would like to see other players come in because that helps to push everyone on
7359385 may have shut down an important source of information that has already led to a series of al qaida arrests
7359386 the british do not however appear to have finished gathering enough evidence to prosecute the 13 in the courts successfully
7359387 it is likely that the 5 went underground on hearing that khan was in custody
7359388 jason is unlikely to play at wembley but wild horses wouldnt stop scully appearing in such a big match in his last season
7359389 spain was fabulous everything we did we tried to stop them we could not stop them completely it was a great basketball game where everybody involved played at the highest level and i think it brought out the best in us said krzyzewski
7359390 obviously we started a little bit slow i think brazil has more experience playing for gold medals than we do so they seemed a little more comfortable at the beginning of the match but after the first set you could tell they were upset with what was going on and we came about changing things in the second set
7359391 and then after that i thought it was just two good teams battling hard it was a tough match
7359392 m s vale prevenir que lamentar es por ello que protecci n civil determin instalar la alerta verde en los municipios de los cabos la paz y comond julio se acerca a baja california sur y es posible que alcance la categor a de hurac n
7359393 it was another one of those damn bea arthur dreams
7359394 i had to go with a new player for the
7359395 not bad but you know why black only comes in xl dont you
7359396 you cant put it in words what he has done here
7359397 arriscamos muito e se analisarmos bem o rog rio praticamente n o teve de fazer nenhuma defesa n s arriscamos mais e o goleiro deles tamb m trabalhou mais n s temos de buscar o resultado fora e foi o que fizemos at poder amos ter feito mais
7359398 foi um jogo igual e taticamente os dois marcaram forte nenhum jogador se destacou no jogo o que me agradou foram os dois gols e poder amos ter feito mais o que n o me agradou foi a falta de aten o no primeiro gol deles e o segundo foi irregular
7359399 eu n o vi pela televis o mas o p nalti foi claro l em s o paulo aconteceu isso e hoje domingo de novo
7359400 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7359401 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7359402 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the
7359403 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7359404 she has said repeatedly that and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7359405 doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7359406 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7359407 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7359408 utterly vapid devoid of context frequently wrong and wedded to narratives that defy all logic and reality
7359409 liberals believe that they cant get a fair shake from the media anymore
7359410 thats an exact mirror of what the right did with talk radio
7359411 corrupted by their need to be part of the establishment
7359412 one of the hallmarks of netroots culture was a complete disconnect from history meaning basically anything that had happened before 1998
7359413 so burning was the netroots contempt for washington insiders and the mainstream media that they were moved to dismiss not just the individuals who fell into these categories but all the knowledge such people had accumulated
7359414 the disdain for the media is a central tenant of the philosophy its one of the boxes to check
7359415 netroots look upon this great right wing apparatus with unconcealed envy
7359416 since when does anyone besides toolbag republicans consider the media to be liberal
7359417 i think weve reached a point where by volume theres far more on the left
7359418 become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
7359419 i used to get a lot more on the right
7359420 were born too late because they would have been great and editor of openleft agreed theres more pushback than in the last cycle
7359421 the people on the left no longer see the media as a third party intermediary
7359422 they just see it as part of the you go after media figures as if theyre part of the opposition campaign its how they need to be treated
7359423 certainly taken my share of hits from the left on
7359424 i find that intemperance is intemperance from whichever direction its coming
7359425 the methods used are always the same quotes taken out of context or chopped apart with ellipses etc but i do find the broad brush dismissal of the mainstream media very frustrating especially at this moment when were staggering toward the boneyard
7359426 even on mydd which is a liberal blog every time i criticize obama i get a huge amount of slack from his supporters
7359427 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7359428 will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7359429 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7359430 so you know whos fighting for you its not those guys whore gonna be meeting in minnesota its the folks whore meeting in denver
7359431 i really need to look more on the mccain side in terms of what he may be saying about some of the specific issues
7359432 la evaluaci n del impacto a primera vista sugiere un retraso de d a por d a
7359433 pero si no podemos encontrar algo y esto significa un retraso de d a por d a entonces eso se puede trabajar perfectamente decidimos utilizar infraestructura del transbordador para el ares i x sabiendo que esto pod a ocurrir de manera que todos estamos trabajando como un equipo
7359434 next president would be the guy landing helicopters inside the green zone taking people off the roof

7359436 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7359437 he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7359438 and i was pleased that senator clinton gave such a robust endorsement to senator biden as the nominee yesterday i think it was a good choice i think everybody recognizes it
7359439 he has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration
7359440 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people are going to make in november
7359441 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think obamas made a very wise selection
7359442 as condi es de vida n o s o f ceis todos est o sofrendo por causa dos pre os altos

7359453 ive actual enjoyed having a practice week thats been healthy ive kind of been going from not playing and then jumping straight into tournaments which isnt ideal you know but youve got to kind of play the hand youre dealt so its been a good week and you know hopefully ill be there when the final comes around
7359454 its obviously the one if youre an american you look forward to the most every year theres also a certain energy unlike any other tournament its probably not only a tennis tournament but an event things like today going on outside it is a special place for me
7359455 i think the biggest thing about new york is playing a night session its a different animal than any other tournament i feel comfortable in the fact that ive been in most situations here at this tournament good and bad so id like to think im ready for it
7359456 i think hes playing great i was hitting with him he was playing really well we had a really good practice he was serving huge i guess thats not really a surprise when hes making a lot of first serves a high percentage hes very very tough to break and tough to deal with
7359457 he puts a lot of implied pressure on your serve just by serving that well on these courts quick as they are the ball is flying a little hes going to be dangerous hes got the confidence since hes won here before id look out for him to be dangerous
7359458 andy is going to get back to austin and really
7359459 i have no clue if they are 16 i cannot make that call it could be true one little girl has a missing tooth
7359460 i think its more cheating than doping to look in the eye of everybody and to show up with a team underage my god its not good
7359461 i believe the officials will deal with it ill leave it at that
7359462 if you dont want to use your presentation to persuade people to take an action and all you want to do is impart information send them a memo
7359463 you have to read a book in a linear form
7359464 he could talk about how he blocked the senate from voting to drill for oil even as gas prices skyrocketed and then sent the senate on a five week vacation
7359465 the gang of 10 plan doesnt allow offshore drilling in the greatest oil reserves
7359466 the plan doesnt open oil shale reserves which could contain three times the amount of oil as in saudi arabia and it would raise energy taxes that consumers could end up paying
7359467 when hispanics needed a friend in congress during the immigration debate who stood up who spoke out john mccain
7359468 senator mccain worked with republicans and democrats alike to form immigration legislation
7359469 if obama didnt even have the courage to stand up for immigrants how can he claim to have the strength to change the way washington works
7359470 john mccain is ready to lead barack obama is not
7359471 n o h mais nenhuma chance de encontrar algu m vivo

7359496 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
7359497 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons

7359506 i felt like i had run the same time all season
7359507 it just got me really excited about this cross country season
7359508 anybody in the state would feel lucky to have them on their team even if they werent such great runners because theyre such great kids
7359509 thats what i feel about all our kids but when you have two kids that have that mix together its special
7359510 rarely do you see them step up and take charge of practice and say were doing it this way kiahs the more vocal of the two sophia is reserved but makes her presence felt in other ways
7359511 attitude is essential you cant run a 5k if you have any negative thoughts so keeping a good attitude keeping everyone healthy and loving the sport is important
7359512 i want them to know why we do every workout and if they dont i want them to ask me and they do i tell them what were trying to accomplish whether its oxygen delivery or lactate threshold i tell what theyre going to do at practice and what they can expect to get out of it and when theyre going to get the biggest benefit from it so when it comes to race day they know they have already done what they have to do to prepare
7359513 i always let him know what im thinking and how im feeling i can understand that with a coach how that might get annoying but he always listens to me and its not just like passive listening he listens and he does something
7359514 he sets the tone for our team hes really dedicated to it we always know what were doing and whats going to help us we always know that when the race comes were probably the most prepared team
7359515 but i liked it a lot and i trained really hard before 8th grade and i kept improving and once you improve you just want to stick with it
7359516 i thought id be the worst person ever to run
7359517 i was really really slow but i liked it anyway
7359518 in cross country the slower people just get more playing time
7359519 after my first season in 8th grade i loved it
7359520 its better than any other sport would make you feel
7359521 my mom was really good and just ran a marathon
7359522 i did it instead of soccer and i just loved it
7359523 i had been swimming since i was 10 or 11 and i was competitive at a very high level
7359524 theres just no time for drama when you do this the people around you become your best friends
7359525 even when we get into our interval and repeat work they are still responsible for their times i record all of that so they can see their progression
7359526 summer is the base for september and september is the base for championships
7359527 there are workouts needed in october for speed and oxygen delivery and racing does not fit
7359528 we were thinking about ntn but after everything changed we learned not to look so far ahead and to just worry about whats coming up
7359529 this is august and states is in november if we take it one race at a time and win states thats great if not and its still our best it has to be enough

7359538 con todo respeto lo que este se or habl dista mucho de un vende patrias un hambriento de poder este se or pag un boleto muy caro por hablar ante estas personas creo que si las personas que estaban con l perdieran un ser querido este m xico seria diferente yo por mi parte voy a cambiar mi mentalidad de no a la corrupci n porque es alimentar al que nos hace esto que asco de pa s en el que vivo y m s de sus gobernantes
7359539 a ver se ores ll mense panistas priistas perredistas y anexos es f cil criticar pero realmente quien llega al poder son personas que supuestamente elegimos esto no lo vamos a solucionar peleando que si amlo o calder n quedaron o que s o que no es presidente

7359541 es que a m se me hace que ese el fernandito como que era muy juniors y por eso se lo hicieron as y se las da de muy sabroso y la chingada pero eso s a nadie le importa que el gobierno sea espurio espurio espurio y que andemos sufriendo porque van a privatizar las gasolinas m xico necesita a obrador de presidente para que se arreglen los pedos o t qu opinas carnal
7359542 te las das ac de muy sabroso y la chingada
7359543 a m lo que me da un poco de coraje es que s lo se preocupan por la familia de mart y qu me dicen de las miles de personas que mataron en michoac n los miles de secuestrados que muchos de ellos han muerto y resulta que por la muerte de una persona se rasgan las vestiduras y se dan golpes de pecho se me hace muy hip crita y me hace suponer que s lo al grupo de los allegados pol ticos se les hace justicia
7359544 pues a m me parece que ya nos llev la chingada por qu sencillo porque los criminales est n coludidos con el poder pol tico y la gran mayor a de los pol ticos no quieren dejar sus negocios pi nsenlo ya tenemos presidentes criminales y o corruptos salinas fox gobernadores villanueva mar n ulises ru z bours diputados senadores creel secretarios de estado jueces polic as continua ya van varias veces que los cachan con las manos en la masa y no les hacen nada todo es pura simulaci n si la scjn pudo fallar contra lydia cacho y absolver a mar n con todas las pruebas en contra qu nos espera al resto de los mortales y ese fue s lo un caso documentado la respuesta es simple ya nos carg la chingada vayan a sus marchas la cosa no va cambiar porque todos somos corruptos ni siquiera es cuesti n de partidos

7359551 she was attacked by some stranger that just walked into my house he came in like 10 minutes after i left

7359556 the biden choice seems to have done precisely what barack obama needed it to do it has thrust him back into the lead overall and has consolidated his support among democrats and put him back into the lead among independent voters
7359557 while hillary clinton tops the list of preferred choices for vice president it is all to clear from this latest polling that her negatives far outweigh her positives her presence on the ticket would have dominated the fall campaign and distracted from obamas issues agenda
7359558 interestingly besides the obvious support for mitt romney as mccains vice presidential partner which keeps the race competitive voters seem to be otherwise in favor of condoleezza rice to the number two slot on the gop ticket

7359730 gli atleti hanno un impatto mediatico senza eguali sono soddisfatta il segnale che avevo chiesto a poche ore dalla cerimonia di inaugurazione delle olimpiadi la prima riflessione che mi viene da fare chiedermi perch lo fanno adesso e non lhanno fatto prima avranno visto qualcosa che non gli piaciuto
7359731 sono convinta che il mio messaggio di inizio agosto gli si arrivato distorto leggendo le sue parole mi sono po sorpresa ma non avevo dubbi sul fatto che venti giorni fa si fosse ribellato un ragazzo sensibile uno che non dimentica la sua storia il suo passato vuole incontrarmi lo aspetto
7359732 hanno ragione chi ha il compito di fare politica deve intervenire senza delegare ma il mio auspicio perch gli atleti facessero qualcosa di significativo sul tema dei diritti umani era volutamente rivolto a chi ha la fortuna di avere un impatto immediato sui giovani non dimentichiamoci che i grandi movimenti per la tutela dei diritti civili sono sempre nati dalla gente
7359733 senza lentusiasmo che mi ha sempre accompagnato quanto mi mettevo davanti alla tv per guardare le olimpiadi sul podio si festeggiava fuori i fuochi dartificio ma sullo sfondo un grande equivoco adesso arrivato quel tempo delle riflessioni che io avevo sollecitato prima che iniziassero i giochi
7359734 litalia da sempre sensibile a certe tematiche che mettono al centro battaglie per la difesa dellumanit una posizione bipartisan che va oltre al colore di chi governa adesso mi aspetto la stessa forza che la politica ha assunto ad esempio per la campagna contro la pena di morte cosa ci hanno lasciato i giochi di pechino dobbiamo dare risposte immediate altrimenti il grande equivoco delle olimpiadi rester senza soluzione
7359735 e una questione di coscienza io oggi provo una profonda soddisfazione perch senza alcuna presunzione mi fa piacere capire che il mio pensiero ha trovato qualche risposta forse hanno parlato cos perch si tratta di ragazzi arrivati da realt difficili come russo o di atleti non pi giovanissimi e quindi magari pi attenti a certe tematiche i giochi sono finiti adesso la politica faccia quello che non ha fatto prima perch non mi risulta che in cina sia in atto un cambiamento radicale

7359813 la estad stica es esa ciencia por la que un tipo se come dos
7359814 it is much surprising to find a person who easily preserves himself from committing sins i e earning money from haram sources being injust stealing drinking alcohol or to look at what is unlawful for him to look at while he still finds it difficult to preserve his tongue it happens to see someone who is known with his righteousness all time worshipping and piety but he utters words that cause allahs wrath while he is not aware of such consequences you may see a person who preserves himself from approaching what leads to injustice or any filthy action yet his tongue is not stopping from back biting live and dead people alike without even caring about it
7359815 tell him to ask for me in the masjid and do not say i am not here so that it does not count as a lie
7359816 allah subhanu created for you two ears and one tongue so that what you hear is double what you talk
7359817 i obeyed myself in every aspect that gets me closer to allah hoping to enter jannah be saved from hell fire and to be with the prophets
7359818 did not the shaytaan find anyone else but you to muck with and make him to look like a fool then it was just moments after that and the man came so he welcomed him and treated him kindly
7359819 if a respectable good man sits with you you would be watching every word you utter so that you do not say something wrong yet you know that your words are watched by allah but you still do not watch the words you utter
7359820 i saw the daughter of bin al khaytham asking his permission to go and play so he replied to her go and utter nothing but goodness
7359821 keep in mind always the time when they put pieces of cotton in your eyes referring to his death
7359822 you did not fulfill the trust of the man when he let you sit with him since you told us what he said furthermore you did not fulfill my rights upon you when you told me what i dislike to hear about one of my brothers
7359823 whoever knows and realize that his words he utters are part of his deeds he surely will speak only with what concerns him
7359824 we searched into where wara refers to the status where a person avoid doing what is halal fearing that it has a suspicion of haram can be found and we realized that wara is rarely can be found and if it is found it will be the least of it in tongues
7359825 o allah save us and protect us and save the believers from the evilness of our tongues
7359826 every hour which son of adam lived will be viewed and screened to him and every hour he lived and did not mention or remembered allah in that hour he will weep on himself for wasting such an hour
7359827 i observed my tongue for thirty years so that i never uttered a word that require me to apologize for
7359828 we were once sitting with ayoob al sukhtayani and we talked and backbited others consequently stop it for if i wished to tell you all what i have talked about today i would have done already but i will not
7359829 i dislike people to disobey allah otherwise i would have wished every one in this world to backbite me there is no equal joy to find in your scale in the judgment day a deed you did not know about or even did
7359830 i was told that you are talking about me behind my back
7359831 if i did then you are more precious to me than myself
7359832 i am not passing through because of a word i said before
7359833 i said people need rain badly because they did not have rain for long time
7359834 and what do you know i know the interest of my slaves and what is beneficial to them
7359835 did not you see conditioning my forgiveness by not doing it ever again
7359836 i ask allahs forgiveness because of what i have just said for what i said is backbiting in allahs right
7359837 in judgment day the slave of allah will be given his book of deeds where he finds rewards for things he did not do so he asks o my lord where did i get these deeds so allah replies to him saying
7359838 it is because the filthy smell of backbiting filled our noses nowadays so that we know no other smell but that one
7359839 he is more reasonable and smarter to let his tongue controlled with what erases his good deeds
7359840 i dislike uttering evilness about myself by sui9ng my tongue yet it is enough to know that i did not believe what was said and still joining the relationship between you and me

7359842 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words

7359845 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7359846 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7359847 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7359848 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7359849 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth

7359867 the best of my ummah would be those of the generation nearest to mine then those nearest to them then those nearest to them
7359868 the month of ramadan is that in which the qur n was revealed
7359869 al aswad b yaz d used to complete reading the entire qur n every two nights in ramadan he would sleep between maghrib and ish outside of ramadan he would complete reading the qur n every six nights
7359870 he used to always observe his prayers in congregation and was constant in the recitation of the qur n he would always complete a reading of the entire qur n by friday however in ramadan he would do so every day and retreat to the eastern minaret of the mosque
7359871 he learned islamic law and read the qur n he was known for his charity and his good deeds in the month of ramadan he would read the qur n thirty times
7359872 umar b al khatt b ordered ubayy b ka b and tam m al d r to lead the people in prayer in ramadan they would each read hundreds of verses at a go until we had to support ourselves with canes due to the length of time we had to stand we would only finish praying close to the time of fajr
7359873 by the time we finished our prayers in ramadan the servants would have to rush to prepare food in fear of fajr coming in
7359874 the reciters leading the prayers would complete the reading of s rah al baqarah in eight units of prayer when the reciters took twelve units of prayer to complete it the people regarded it as if the reciters were making things easy for them
7359875 allahs messenger peace be upon him was the most generous of all people in doing good and he was at his most generous during the month of ramadan gabriel used to meet with him every year throughout the month of ramadan so the prophet could recite the qur n to him whenever gabriel met with him he became more generous than a beneficial breeze
7359876 it is liked for a person to increase his charity in the month of ramadan this is following the prophets example it is also in consideration of the peoples needs and their welfare since so many of them are distracted from earning their livelihood due to their preoccupation with fasting and prayer
7359877 whoever does not abandon false speech and acting falsely then allah has no need of his abandoning food and drink
7359878 if one of you starts off the day fasting he should avoid obscene speech and ignorant behavior if someone abuses him or starts to fight with him he should reply by saying i am fasting i am fasting
7359879 one does not merely fast from food and drink but also from lying from falsehood from vain talk and from swearing
7359880 fasting is not to leave off food and drink but rather to leave off lying falsehood and vain talk
7359881 when you fast then be on your guard as mush as possible
7359882 when you fast your hearing your vision and your tongue should also fast by avoiding lies and sins you should not abuse your servant you should maintain your composure and dignity on the day that you fast do not make your fasting day the same as your normal day
7359883 when you fast do not act in an ignorant manner and do not insult people if someone acts ignorantly towards you say i am fasting
7359884 if you avoid two things then your fast will be alright you must avoid backbiting and lying
7359885 could the shaikh give us some words of benefit for the blessed month of ramadaan on this fine occasion
7359886 allaah the exalted and most high says in the noble quraan
7359887 whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action then allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink
7359888 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast and delay the pre dawn meal
7359889 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to pray the maghrib prayer
7359890 my ummah will continue to be upon good as long as they hasten to break the fast
7359891 and the sun has set then the fasting persons fast is broken
7359892 if one of us had climbed onto his camel he would have seen the sun
7359893 my ummah will continue upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast
7359894 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in the hand of one of you then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
7359895 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel
7359896 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
7359897 because he gives the adhaan in order to awaken the person who is sleeping and so that the person who wishes to eat the pre dawn meal can do so so eat and drink until ibn umm maktoon gives the adhaan
7359898 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has fulfilled his need from it
7359899 if someone hears the adhaan and has some food in his mouth then he must spit it out
7359900 beware of ghuluww exceeding the limits in the religion because those who came before you were destroyed by their exceeding the limits in their religion
7359901 if one of you hears the call to prayer whilst the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has completed his need from it
7359902 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out
7359903 just as he hates that disobedience to him be committed
7359904 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out
7359905 o jogo foi de um tempo para cada time o inter encaixou bem o seu jogo no primeiro tempo com seus tr s jogadores de habilidade alex dalessandro e nilmar

7359907 o gol que o obina perdeu dif cil de perder mas saio satisfeito com o resultado temos uma tabela dif cil agora mas pelo que temos jogado ultimamente estou confiante
7359908 n s arriscamos mais do que o time deles o goleiro deles trabalhou mais e fora de casa temos sempre que buscar o resultado gostei muito da parte t tica o time entrou forte
7359909 acho que o segundo gol do coritiba foi irregular o outro foi desaten o nossa fomos muito mal na falta de aten o do primeiro gol
7359910 na situa o em que n s estamos temos que ganhar fora de casa o bom resultado no futebol s ganhar e para ganhar temos que arriscar tem que apertar pressionar buscar os gols jogamos da mesma forma dentro e fora de casa
7359911 eu n o vi pela televis o mas o p nalti foi claro l em s o paulo aconteceu isso e hoje domingo de novo

7359918 atletas como o rodrigo souto e o ada lton que hoje n o esteve com a gente s t m a ajudar s o mais do que jogadores s o pessoas ntegras e que s fazem bem ao nosso grupo
7359919 o rodrigo representa muito para o grupo uma pessoa muito especial h uns 20 dias me disse que estava sendo injusti ado com a acusa o de doping mas deus justo falei para ele acreditar e a volta dele foi coroada com uma vit ria
7359920 vi meus companheiros dando for a muita gente orando para que eu pudesse voltar essa for a maior foi primordial para que eu pudesse voltar aos campos minha felicidade foi ver meus companheiros contentes com meu retorno ao santos

7359924 oh gosh you know where do i know this man from
7359925 me assustei com um direcionamento que teve ao palmeiras como se fosse s o palmeiras que n o vencesse fora de casa
7359926 aquilo foi algo dirigido um direcionamento para se ver o que n o realidade n o se pode caracterizar quem fez isso como a torcida do palmeiras complicado mas faz parte
7359927 o palmeiras sofreu cr ticas contundentes em rela o m partida do diego souza no beira rio dos gols de cabe a que temos sofrido e podem at criticar que a expectativa de vencer fora de casa com a chegada do luxemburgo n o se confirmou isso procede o que n o procede o que n o realidade e quem escreveu aquilo foram dois ou tr s
7359928 tenho de me concentrar em trabalhar sei das minhas qualidades e dos meus defeitos e vou trabalhar neles
7359929 o time lutou do come o ao fim e todo mundo est de parab ns
7359930 gra as a deus hoje o time ganhou foi uma vit ria na vontade no sacrif cio e no amor camisa o time foi frente e conseguiu os tr s pontos

7359957 there were no significant studies examining the long term health of people in communities with naturally fluoridated water however exposure via drinking water at levels not much higher than what was proposed for fluoridation had been associated in numerous published studies beginning around 1940 with serious adverse skeletal and neuromuscular effects in india and other countries opposition to fluoridation initially came from scientists concerned about the lack of good evidence on possible health risks
7359958 those who did openly oppose fluoridation were often subject of personal attack and professional reprisals for decades mainstream scientific journals would reject for publication any paper that did not articulate a strictly pro fluoridation position on risk and benefit questions

7359961 leading phs dental researchers lobbied every leading scientific organization to gain endorsements of fluoridation they cast fluoridation as a product of scientific progress under siege from anti scientific forces and rallied the scientific community in political support of the measure they carried out a few studies looking for possible adverse effects of fluoridation the studies were poorly designed and inconclusive by todays standards but they found no convincing evidence of harm the phs declared the issues closed the debate over the studies were roundly criticized as inadequate and biased by leading opponents of the day but fluoridation advocates rapidly took the stance that there was no longer any scientific doubt that fluoridation was safe and effective their political strategy was simply to steamroll the opposition to insist that opponents had no basis for any valid objections they focused on political campaigning not on research in fact research all but halted as it was politically inexpedient for the phs to be studying questions they had already declared adequately answered
