1360000 this is going to help the sales of certified used cars
1360001 if you moved up a grade or two when leasing a new car because of the low monthly payment maybe now consumers will move up a grade or two in lower cost certified used cars with a nav system and fancy stereo
1360002 i think were now in the twilight of a new leasing age in which therell be new alternatives maybe groups of dealers or groups of banks offering leases
1360003 i think the consumer now needs time to pause and do his or her homework to determine if leasing is the right thing
1360004 no one four years ago considered the cost of gas today would be 4 a gallon in one respect however the guy who leased a big suv four years ago won at bingo because he can bring it back now the guy who bought one four years ago is hurting

1360047 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1360048 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1360049 you got to take every chance you have just to protect the airways
1360050 its really just taking every precaution necessary who knows how bad its going to be in a few days so if you can resist any air pollution any contaminants then you know its better performance hopefully
1360051 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1360052 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1360053 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1360054 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1360055 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through

1360137 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means

1360139 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along

1360145 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
1360146 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases

1360154 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing

1360156 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
1360157 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand

1360365 short of problems in the middle east or hurricanes i think were going to continue to fall
1360366 i think below 100 could be a possibility in the next two months
1360367 its dropped nearly 30 so far from the highs so its only got to go another 18

1360386 democratic rep don cazayoux sent a letter to house majority leader steny hoyer last week demanding a vote on more domestic oil exploration
1360387 in his letter cazayoux says the current debate seems to be bogged down in partisan one upsmanship and said that a vote on domestic drilling should be included in any package of energy legislation that will be taken up in the house
1360388 as the saying goes actions speak louder than words and no amount of words that don cazayoux pens to his liberal leadership can undo the laundry list of votes he has cast in congress to block sensible energy bills
1360389 the audacity that don cazayoux has to play a smoke and mirrors game with the voters in louisiana is deplorable

1360418 i have never felt so concerned about a single policy issue in my professional life the reason is because it is being fundamentally misconstrued under the model by being a good global citizen australia by its own actions loses competitiveness against countries free riding on our efforts these countries gain from being slow to act or not acting at all as production shifts to them their imports decline and their exports increase the architecture of the policy is misconceived
1360419 if we cannot cut a deal on global trade liberalisation where even unilateral action confers benefits on most if not all countries what chance do we have of cutting a deal where such action confers zero or negative benefits and we only gain if we all move together
1360420 commercially the us china and india and others are unlikely to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on an emissions trading system production based model recession or even slowing economic growth make such expectations laughable jobs are already being lost
1360421 no more losses will be acceptable for promotion of distant climate change objectives
1360422 attempts to control australian production are likely to drive it offshore with less stringent or no policy controls over emissions
1360423 in a world where all countries acted together to deal with greenhouse gas emissions it wouldnt matter whether we targeted production or consumption but realistically we assume countries will not act together in this situation the difference between production and consumption is crucial
1360424 sets up incentives to shift local production economic activity and employment whether for exports or for import competition offshore
1360425 diverting production employment and trade to countries not acting in the same way to curb greenhouse gas emissions production
1360426 it cannot work or work very well in a world where producers can relocate production to where its most cost advantageous
1360427 carried to their logical and equitable conclusion would carve out all exports and all import competing local production
1360428 imagine the uproar if john howard had proposed a gst that hit exports and exempted imports instead of the other way around effectively that is the starting point for the current government this seems to be a policy no brainer

1360472 teos cockatoo teaches a lot about caring for pets and treating them well this story affirms that our pets reflect who we are
1360473 i enjoyed reading the book because of the descriptive style of the author she characterized the two owners very well and gave a clear picture of how the poor cockatoo stayed still in his cage
1360474 artist bet illustration were creatively done as she used all sorts of shapes and colors to enhance the scenes my favorite drawings were of teo and the cockatoo spending time together
1360475 although the book may have some nasty words i would still recommend it for children my age another good thing about the book is that it contained a filipino translation of the story which would help readers appreciate and understand it

1360512 it takes a candidate ad to put these things into the media bloodstream and now theyre a bit more encouraged to run with it
1360513 its certainly true that mccain gets far more money from donors in the oil and gas industry than obama does
1360514 and theres no question that mccains recent support for expanding offshore drilling is a position that the industry favors
1360515 it also gives a somewhat misleading picture of mccains tax plan which is pro business but not specifically pro oil

1360612 no nation no society no community can hold its head high and claim to be part of the civilized world if it condones the practice of discriminating against one half of humanity represented by women

1360616 here in the united states unitarians believe that we actually invented american democracy
1360617 thomas jefferson considered himself a unitarian and john adams and john quincy adams were two other early unitarian presidents
1360618 and unitarian universalists have always been prominent in all of the social movements in this country we were prominent in the abolitionist movement and unitarian leaders both men and women were very prominent in the struggle for womens empowerment womens right to vote and so it has continued on to the present day we support the struggle of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons so we have been a part of the american democratic tradition since there was one
1360619 unitarian universalism is a faith that is not based on a particular creed
1360620 instead it is grounded in a few deeply held principles first among these principles is the inherent worth and dignity of all people a belief that compels us to speak on important justice issues
1360621 this has been part of our mission since early days it will take time for us to heal but let me reassure you that we will not change our beliefs or compromise our demands for social justice

1360792 je l nger dieser zustand anh lt desto schwieriger wird es unser mittelfristiges ergebnisziel zu erreichen
1360793 es w re ein gro er fehler clement auszuschlie en der mit seinen positionen in der spd nicht allein dasteht
1360794 wir m ssen tats chlich abwarten was in hessen passiert
1360795 angenommen die spd in hessen beschlie t sich von der linkspartei nicht nur tolerieren zu lassen sondern auch eine koalition mit ihr einzugehen soll da nicht ein gefestigtes und berzeugtes spd mitglied sagen d rfen unter diesen umst nden kann ich die nicht w hlen
1360796 damals waren wir in einer extremen oppositionspolitik die nicht mehr vereinbar war mit der entwicklung der welt nach godesberg stand die neue konomische grundorientierung fest
1360797 darum bin ich auf der seite von wolfgang clement der auch k nftig sagen will wenn es in einzelnen bundesl ndern koalitionen mit den linken gibt werde ich die partei diesmal nicht w hlen
1360798 aber es ist f r die spd voraussetzung f r eine konstruktive entwicklung weil wir unseren weg in einer vollkommen ver nderten globalen welt erst noch finden m ssen
1360799 es ist schwer eine sozialdemokratische mehrheit zustande zu bringen aber das darf eben auch nicht das endg ltige ziel sein das ziel muss vielmehr sein die partei als volkspartei auf eine grundlage zu stellen die unter den kommenden schwierigen wirtschaftlichen bedingungen bestand hat
1360800 er hat den versuch unternommen der partei eine zerrei probe zu ersparen indem er viele kompromisse eingegangen ist ich pers nlich meine die spd braucht eine zerrei probe eine mit positivem ergebnis die partei braucht klare formulierungen und keine weiteren versuche bei allem immer alle einzubinden
1360801 aber herauswerfen w rde ich die leute nicht ich w rde brigens auch ottmar schreiner nicht herauswerfen obgleich er in seinen worten die spd viel deutlicher verlassen hat als clement

1360804 i have always loved you and always will i have fallen in love with every part of you you have shown me what it means to be weak strong and truly alive its just that my heart is not mine to give my heart belongs to another i can only hope that i will leave you with a love that you will never forget i had hoped you would never say the words because i knew when you did i would have to go i had hoped you wouldnt fall because i would not be able to catch you when you did

1360929 one of the finest poetical playwrights to have written in english
1360930 i was already notorious before the nobel but my constituency enlarged being the first black nobel laureate and the first african the african world considered me personal property i lost the remaining shreds of my anonymity even to walk a few yards in london paris or frankfurt without being stopped it was and is hell

1360932 jotting a few lines down when an image strikes you you can creatively distract yourself from the consuming preoccupation of trying to oust a tenacious monster
1360933 these days zimbabwes robert mugabe is moving close to occupying the skin of king baabu
1360934 should expose reflect even magnify the decadent rotted underbelly of a society that has lost its direction in the confidence that sooner or later society will recognise itself
1360935 the problem hadnt been exhausted dramatically i wanted to take it to the limits in king baabu
1360936 deprives us of a great deal of wisdom with the fury of his complexities
1360937 both for a political boldness that landed him in prison and for a commanding intellect that is manifest in every genre he tackles
1360938 theyve opted out seceded because the constitution does not permit theocracy in a secular federation
1360939 i cannot belong to a nation which permits such barbarities as stoning to death and amputation i dont care what religion it is
1360940 but its the political dimension here it would be a triumph handed to the zealots ive said if necessary ill go to the contest and escort them on to the stage
1360941 the blatant aggressiveness of theocracies i find distressing because i grew up when christians muslim and animists lived peacefully together
1360942 i was a socialist but i couldnt accept the marxist interpretation of history
1360943 it conflicted with the untidy non scientific element which is human nature
1360944 on the bus people would rather stand than take the empty seat beside you
1360945 it didnt work my tutor said soyinka why do you have such purple passages i was inflicting dire tortures on the boers
1360946 i fed my resentment of the indignities i experienced in britain into that play and my politics we dreamt of being part of a liberation army in south africa
1360947 but i realised the problems that would preoccupy me were different i wanted to explore the mythological resources of my society i couldnt wait to get back to nigeria
1360948 with grandiose ideas about the kind of nation i must assist in building
1360949 i knew we were in serious trouble they were ostentatious exhibitionist profligate they couldnt wait to step into the shoes of their departing colonial masters we realised the struggle had to begin at our own doors with the enemy within
1360950 it was to warn against the replacement of external with internal domination
1360951 it sprang from an early consciousness that were romanticising history when theres a real problem of power
1360952 like sophocles and euripedes soyinka derived a secular poetics and aesthetics from religious mythology fusing yoruba and greek elements into a distinctively african notion of tragedy
1360953 they think anything else is a european affectation never mind that they wear italian cut shoes and that their civil wars are fought with the most sophisticated weapons ive no patience with such phonies
1360954 theres great variety in my work some is so winnowed that school children love it
1360955 i come from a culture which uses language in a very dense way
1360956 necessary difficulty they use a variety of western and african idioms but move between them fluidly without signposting the boundaries between cultures
1360957 most complete work of prison literature ever written in africa
1360958 i coined the term wasted generation because of the scale of our ambition as young people we were the renaissance people
1360959 performances were stopped some actors were arrested or attacked by political thugs
1360960 he speaks his mind and hes willing to stick his neck out and fight hes not afraid of anybody
1360961 but neither is he a mysogynist he is a man who respects women though he also loves women as a source of pleasure and doesnt find that offensive his women are earth mothers he idealises them as goddesses
1360962 i hate talking about my personal life theres so much of ones life one lives publicly when i get home its what i have left
1360963 in our tradition we dont count our children in my case the gods have been kind maybe over generous
1360964 there are so many forces tearing nigeria apart that i ask myself if it is a nation
1360965 tinge of racism in the immigration policies of many nations
1360966 very respectful of actors tough about what he doesnt agree with but open
1360967 still able to write plays that are cathartic full of warning and pity
1360968 tragedy of woles situation is that because nigerias been so war torn hes not been able to build a substantive theatre company ideally hed have a permanent troupe of fine actors who understood the culture from which hes writing and could transmit both its authenticity and its universality
1360969 hes been an example for people because hes lived what he believes in
1360970 no sense of having been away id carried the country in my head
1360971 marvellous to step on the bit of turf in which i intend to be buried
1360972 those who have seized the reins of power are abachas collaborators if abacha were to return from the dead theyd be the first to lick his feet
1360973 his cause can still be pursued by his henchmen or their mercenaries including religious fanatics who consider people like me enemies of their faith
1360974 this is the cleanest and best place ive been to all day today
1360975 dont love my jp style first meet jean paul for a honest assesment
1360976 the value of the additional equity will be reflected in the sale price for northern rock on return to the private sector

1360978 confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1360979 while blue light seen by hubble shows the presence of young stars it is the absence of infrared light in the sensitive spitzer images that was conclusive in showing that these are truly young galaxies without an earlier generation of stars
1360980 we have a time frame for development and trail of air version of brahmos which is going on as per schedule
1360981 by 2009 trails for the air version of brahmos will start and it will be ready for induction in the air force by 2012
1360982 we have to wait for the availability and complete the design for trials from the aircraft
1360983 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1360984 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1360985 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1360986 we are sorry for the incident and the damage to the equipment that belonged to the reporters
1360987 if we dont receive a clear message from them iran we will have no choice but to pursue additional measures the p5 1 political directors have scheduled a conference call for tomorrow
1360988 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1360989 this was very good and a much needed thing in the village people will have better environment and even their economic condition would benefit with the sale of fruits and vegetables from these trees
1360990 whenever we go to villages a large crowd gathers at that place and wherever we have a camp we make it a point to carry at least 10 000 to 15 000 saplings i keep on telling the farmers that it is their fixed deposit since we are not into any government job and cannot hope to seek pension in old age so it is a noble way of warding off poverty and pollution at the same time and securing a good future
1360991 i doubt if well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1360992 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1360993 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1360994 the matter is now closed trust me he will play here next season
1360995 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1360996 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1360997 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1360998 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1360999 however i agree that it is a case of systematic doping this would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban
1361000 i shouldnt really say very much as i am no longer a part of the iaaf but this is a very bad story
1361001 i find it frustrating that such planned cheating is still going on i am very disappointed
1361002 of course the procedure is still going on and it is for the russian federation to find out what was going on
1361003 father i am victorious real failure can never happen because i am doing all things through christ who strengthens
1361004 too rich too sweet too salty and which are not strictly necessary
1361005 we have not banned the word obese but we have chosen not to use it
1361006 theres no point giving them a letter that doesnt have any impact on their behaviour
1361007 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1361008 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1361009 because it was a localized downpour we couldnt really make a guess
1361010 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1361011 but he not only lived through it but by his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1361012 he is a great citizen of russia and my favorite writer
1361013 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1361014 people with his understanding of life were our last hope
1361015 today young children are growing up and they dont know anything
1361016 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1361017 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1361018 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1361019 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1361020 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1361021 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1361022 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1361023 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1361024 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1361025 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1361026 oh god let me get rid of this thing before anybody else sees it please say it isnt just me
1361027 oh got let me get rid of before anyone else sees it
1361028 a dead israeli could run that country better than a live gentile any day
1361029 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1361030 look at this crowd look at all these obama mamas and obama daddies if you are like me you are hungry for a change in direction
1361031 we have to offer not a case just for whats wrong with today
1361032 we have to offer a vision for whats right about tomorrow and how we can get there
1361033 john mccain is still stuck on the low road express
1361034 he doesnt get it hes even dangerous i think for the direction of this country
1361035 hes inspired the nation hes coming off one of the most productive legislative sessions in recent years
1361036 one of the finest public servants we have in this country
1361037 were now in the process of bringing the party together so we come out of that convention entirely unified and ready to take on the last leg of this journey
1361038 obama says no to drilling yes to checking tire pressure
1361039 i was out on the streets the days after the 2000 election protesting the stolen votes then
1361040 i would be a hypocrite not to protest this you cant just take peoples votes and hand them to people
1361041 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved

1361044 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1361045 an enzyme called telomerase can extend the length of the telomeres so that they can continue to divide and this can happen in some special cells such as sperm and egg cells but not normally in cells that make up the organs of the body
1361046 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy
1361047 as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1361048 observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of oestrogens role in schizophrenia
1361049 oestrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1361050 we are really pleased that graham has chosen to stay with us especially after a lot of interest from other counties he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area
1361051 im delighted to be staying at durham i love playing for the club and the decision to stay was an easy one to make its been a great environment for me to develop my game and the set up here has been great for me over the years the team is definitely going in the right direction and i want to be able to play a major part in the clubs continued success

1361066 on the demand side energy participants are sensing that the global growth picture is deteriorating rapidl and is now no longer confined solely to the united states
1361067 mr mccain had himself touted as the american president americans have been waiting for
1361068 the racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control
1361069 maybe mccains noticed obamas big lead with those hard workin white men in the heartlan
1361070 mr obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity the reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black
1361071 part of the reason may be obamas perceived reversals of his positions on issues such as the war

1361077 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues
1361078 while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask
1361079 the danger of faith and politics is we use faith to support our politics i think christians are easily duped by people who want to talk our language

1361093 intensive mothering insists that mothers acquire professional level skills such as those of a therapist pediatrician

1361096 the personnel entered a second floor meeting room unaware that siddiqui was being held there unsecured behind a curtain
1361097 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1361098 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once
1361099 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and and took her

1361109 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1361110 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1361111 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1361112 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1361113 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1361114 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1361115 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1361116 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1361117 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1361118 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1361119 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1361120 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world

1361135 the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right much more than a tire gauge but thats not whats so pernicious about the tire gauge attacks politics aint beanbag and obama has defended himself against worse smears the real problem with the attacks on his tire gauge plan is that efforts to improve conservation and efficiency happen to be the best approaches to dealing with the energy crisis the cheapest cleanest quickest and easiest ways to ease our addiction to oil reduce our pain at the pump and address global warming

1361138 las vegas can serve as a bellwether for mainstream companies and organizations that are not necessarily focused on the environment to say you know what
1361139 the way i always look at the palazzo for example is that the casino is 250 000 square feet and the rest of the project is 8 million square feet so we needed to be able to recognize the achievement on the bulk of the project
1361140 you think vegas you just think of this huge international symbol of waste
1361141 i love las vegas but its very existence is almost a crime against nature no amount of conservation can replace what ought not be used in the first place
1361142 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence the law plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes
1361143 the purposes of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation
1361144 the argument that somehow they needed a new statute to encourage thoughtful contemplation among students is simply not true
1361145 legislators repeatedly emphasized that students could stare at their shoes think about upcoming exams think about their pets engage in other nonverbal activities during the moment of silence as well as pray if they wished

1361161 the girls were total troupers and despite being a bit shaken they simply went out and gave a brilliant performance like nothing had happened the security team was very discreet and didnt want to worry them unduly
1361162 but once they were safely on stage the decision was made to call the police to get the guy arrested
1361163 in the end after apologising profusely he was released without charge

1361185 a highly classified sensitive operation with far reaching national security implications that took place in 1968
1361186 a redacted archaeological team uncovered a large metallic object in a remote area of southern redacted which is a close nato ally of ours
1361187 the object was believed to be an alien spacecraft that had crashed approximately 200 million years ago according to the archaeological team the site subsequently was examined by a usaf recovery team which then put the age of the alien craft at approximately 150 million years ago
1361188 our scientists used the absolute dating method employing decaying radioactive isotopes sedimentary rock formations and the fact that the object was embedded into the rock were used to estimate the age of the alien craft
1361189 the craft was transported to the state of redacted and then to the giant redacted lab complex in redacted and opened
1361190 the alien craft contained two highly decomposed alien bodies and decayed animals which were apparently abducted by these alien beings the animals were small dinosaurs on board the alien craft
1361191 the craft was stored at redacted and years of intense research were conducted the last time i checked the research team ruled out the craft being of eben origin
1361192 however no one could tell where it came from the alien bodies were far too decomposed to be thoroughly examined they were about 5 feet tall and had very large bulbous heads
1361193 to the best of my knowledge operation redacted is still an ongoing project i personally worked on the operation in the early 70s
1361194 the instruments from the craft were interesting because they were made of small crystal like devices wired together with a form of very fine wire
1361195 the alien propulsion system contained a large chamber with what we called rocks obviously some form of energy in the chamber large vents placed around the chamber vented some sort of power radiation or some form of tremendous energy generated through the vents and into the propulsion chamber which enabled interstellar space travel
1361196 examination of the rocks found zinc and several unknown materials and alloys which we still cannot identify to this day the rocks obviously lost all of their energy over the years they were not radioactive nor did they contain any special properties we could never power up the alien craft in the nearly 40 years weve had possession of it
1361197 we could not locate the actual power system and therefore could never operate any of the equipment contained within the craft however we did find a star chart the chart was created from outside of the earth on the alien home world
1361198 to this day we have been unable to read and decipher the alien star chart the star chart was of a deep area of space but our scientists havent been able to find that specific area of space
1361199 the amazing alien technology on this craft has similarly stumped us while some progress has been made on it since 1968 its been minimal partially due to the poor degraded condition of the alien craft
1361200 the existence of alien civilizations who had already achieved space traveling capabilities zipping around the milky way galaxy and perhaps others truly boggles the mind
1361201 the ebens were perhaps still in their galactic diapers when these alien beings were already visiting other worlds 150 200 mya million years ago and homo sapiens did not even exist
1361202 one can only wonder and speculate where a civilization that had already achieved interstellar space travel would be at today technologically from 150 200 mya
1361203 how many star systems have they visited by now how many other alien civilizations have they made successful contact and interacted with and perhaps carry on some sort of trade with how many solar systems have they visited and mapped out in our milky way galaxy and perhaps those of other galaxies
1361204 one also has to consider the possibility that rather than this crash having occurred in our timeline of 150 200 mya these alien beings traveled to earth from the future to our distant past when dinosaurs ruled as part of a research mission that also boggles the mind

1361219 jonathan played in four games last year and it gave us a chance to see how we operated with him in there at center
1361220 so when faine left we knew we wanted to re sign jonathan and then the question was could we come to an agreement and still keep options open if we couldnt we couldnt take for granted that we were going to be able to re sign him we felt like we needed to come away from free agency with one of our two centers we knew faine would be leaving right away and we were able to re sign goodwin which was a plus
1361221 the experience from last year gave me a lot of confidence
1361222 i knew i could do it and i had confidence in myself for a long time but last year reconfirmed that and i think its made this camp a lot easier for me

1361225 ill admit myself my first two years at guard i struggled once i got to my third year i played better and i gained confidence ever since then it was something i knew i could do especially when i moved to center i became even more confident

1361240 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1361241 georgia believes peace talks are the only way to settle conflicts
1361242 nato has seen the reports of the violent confrontations in the georgian region of south ossetia in the last few days which caused a significant number of casualties
1361243 we call on all parties to de escalate the tensions
1361244 the russian federation represents one of the sides in the conflict and the russian peacekeepers deployed in the conflict zone in south ossetia in fact prop up the separatist regime
1361245 the russian federation is carrying out on georgian land an aggression and actions that violate georgias sovereignty

1361261 the grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid no government program can alter that fact someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma tvs the price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them one way or another rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset based consumption dependent economy will be finally discredited

1361320 augustine wrestles endlessly with the most fundamental questions of existence what can the human mind truly know what is god what is truth what is beauty what is time what is history what is the soul what is memory what is faith what is reason what is the relationship between faith and reason what is justice what is human destiny what are the proper limits of political action where does evil come from how can we reconcile evil and suffering with a belief in a good and almighty god augustine sets the example par excellence of a christian thinker determined to view the whole of life in the light of his faith rather than give a little private corner of it to christ leaving the rest to be squeezed into the mold of contemporary non christian culture
1361321 if you find me short in things impute that to my love of brevity if you find me besides the truth in anything impute that to my infirmity but if you find anything here that serves to your furtherance and joy of the faith impute that to the mercy of god bestowed on you and me yours to serve you with what little i have

1361325 many members of congress make up solutions to things they do not understand and cause problems where there are none or make real problems worse which explains the current run up in gasoline prices

1361334 there are important distinctions between the czech republic situation and the aws 3 band in the united states that m2z has conveniently chosen to ignore

1361343 at amp ts terms of service for mobile wireless broadband customers prohibit all uses that may cause extreme network capacity issues and explicitly identify p2p file sharing applications as such a use
1361344 network management tools to block the use of p2p applications by its mobile wireless broadband customers
1361345 under these terms of service which are similar to those of other wireless providers use of a p2p file sharing application would constitute a material breach of contract for which the users service could be terminated
1361346 a small number of users of p2p file sharing applications served by a particular cell site could severely degrade the service quality enjoyed by all customers
1361347 the vast majority of our customers abide by their contractual commitments
1361348 this strongly suggests that the ability to understand others read their intentions interpret their emotional states predict their behaviour and respond appropriately the very basis of social capacity itself and thus of morality is linked to the involuntary modelling of others that mirror neuron activity makes possible
1361349 when we judge others behaviours attitudes values and beliefs we anchor on ourselves and extrapolate we assume other people like what we like want what we want and believe what we believe

1361352 there is surprisingly little evidence to support the claim that a dysfunction in mirror neurons is the neural mechanism underlying asd
1361353 several studies report multiple anatomical differences between neurotypical and asd individuals that include differences in cell morphology cortical thickness overall brain size and sub cortical volumetric measurements mostly in brain areas

1361375 esta entrevista abrir os olhos a muitas pessoas abalar o isl o at s ra zes e n o estou a exagerar
1361376 onde que h outro caso do seu conhecimento em que um filho de um l der do hamas que foi educado nos dogmas do extremismo isl mico se pronuncie contra o isl o
1361377 um vers culo como amai os vossos inimigos teve um grande impacto sobre mim
1361378 nessa altura eu ainda era mu ulmano e pensava que continuaria a s lo mas todos os dias vi coisas terr veis feitas em nome da religi o por aqueles que se consideravam grandes crentes
1361379 eu estudei o isl o mais a fundo e descobri n o haver respostas nele reexaminei o cor o e os princ pios da f e descobri qu o errado e enganador
1361380 as pessoas que supostamente representam a religi o admiram mais maom do que deus matam pessoas inocentes em nome do isl o espancam as suas mulheres e n o t m qualquer ideia de quem deus
1361381 n o tenho quaisquer d vidas de que v o para o inferno tenho uma mensagem para eles apenas h um caminho para o para so o caminho de jesus que se sacrificou na cruz por todos n s
1361382 eu tentei compreender aquelas pessoas os seus pensamentos a fim de mud los a partir do interior atrav s de uma pessoa forte como o meu pai que me confessou no passado que n o suporta atentados suicidas
1361383 ningu m os conhece e como operam t o bem como eu
1361384 ent o na pris o compreendi que nem toda a gente no hamas como o meu pai ele um homem agrad vel e amig vel mas descobri qu o maus s o os seus colegas
1361385 ap s a minha liberta o perdi a confian a naqueles que ostensivamente representavam o isl o
1361386 voc s judeus devem ter bem consci ncia de que nunca mas nunca ter o paz com o hamas
1361387 o isl o como ideologia que os guia n o lhes permitir alcan ar um acordo de paz com os judeus eles cr em que a tradi o diz que o profeta maom combateu contra os judeus e que portanto eles devem continuar a combat los at morte
1361388 na cultura palestiniana um terrorista suicida transforma se em her i em m rtir
1361389 eles hamas s o cegos e ignorantes verdade que em toda a parte h boas e m s pessoas mas os apoiantes do hamas n o entendem que est o a ser conduzidos por um grupo in quo e cruel que faz lavagem cerebral s crian as e as leva a acreditar que se levarem a cabo um ataque suicida ir o para o para so
1361390 os tirar das trevas e da pris o do isl o
1361391 nesse caminho eles ter o oportunidade de corrigir os seus erros tornar se melhores pessoas e darem uma oportunidade paz no m dio oriente
1361392 mas pelo menos para j as minhas ambi es s o apenas encontrar trabalho um lugar para viver
1361393 n o tenho nenhum dinheiro n o possuo nenhum apartamento
1361394 eu estive em vias de me tornar num dos sem abrigo nos estados unidos
1361395 mas as pessoa da igreja est o a ajudar me estou dependente delas
1361396 eu sei que estou a colocar em perigo a minha vida e mesmo sujeito a perder o meu pai mas espero que ele compreenda isto e que deus lhe d e minha fam lia paci ncia e boa vontade para abrir os olhos para jesus e o cristianismo
1361397 talvez um dia eu possa voltar palestina e a ramallah com jesus no reino de deus

1361400 because the general public license gpl is not universally interpreted the same way by everyone we cant give anyone a legal opinion about how our language relates to the gpl or other oss licenses but based on feedback from the open source community we believe that a broad audience of developers can implement the specification s
1361401 we have taken to a very micro kernel design where code is being removed from the center and pushed out to the edges via interfaces we are taking a linux apache tightly coupled design for modules

1361403 version 2 0 is the culmination of the evolution of i o virtualization for the first time it allows running our software on a customers own hardware
1361404 it reduces the number of lan local area network and wan wide area network ports by 80 percent
1361405 we tried to make the administrators do the least amount of work so we differentiated between server administrators and infrastructure architects for the server admins there is no need to rely on others to approve changes because the infrastructure architects have all the planning done
1361406 i o virtualization is a crucial step towards the next generation data center
1361407 3leaf is leading the charge in this area with a software solution that runs on commodity hardware
1361408 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
1361409 polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their
1361410 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
1361411 we were hoping to use these forms of ads as were other nonprofit groups and other pacs but with this decision nobody is going to do it because it is impractical
1361412 not if they are express advocacy or electioneering communications because you have to air these stupid disclaimers that sound like gobbledygook and take up four seconds out of the ad
1361413 we might redeploy our resources but i have talked to a lot of nonprofit groups and they just dont do tv advertising because they cant afford it if they could do 10 and 15 second spots i think they could have afforded it
1361414 it did not create an exemption for television communications of 10 or 15 seconds or any other duration even though it was aware of the commissions already existing regulatory exceptions for impracticality skywriting and small items pins buttons
1361415 given the agencys spotty record for enforcing federal campaign finance statutes
1361416 the campaign legal center is encouraged by the fact that the newly reconstituted commission did the right thing today by applying the statute as written
1361417 the fccs decision today underscores the importance of internet freedom for consumers and entrepreneurs i have introduced bipartisan legislation the internet freedom preservation act h r 5353 with rep chip pickering r miss to establish a policy framework for resolving this critical issue and to ensure that consumers and entrepreneurs are protected against unreasonable interference or discrimination from broadband network providers
1361418 going forward i believe todays fcc action sends a strong message to the industry that the commission intends to take internet freedom principles seriously and will act to protect the integrity and openness of internet commerce and communications
1361419 for its part i understand that comcast has already begun efforts to modify its network management approach and i believe its efforts to treat content providers in a more nondiscriminatory way from a network management standpoint are laudable and welcome i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
1361420 there has been no market failure to justify the heavy hand of so called net neutrality and i do not believe the commission has the authority to enforce principles as if they were adopted rules
1361421 a bold step to protect the rights of internet users while punishing the unacceptable behavior of comcast
1361422 we have consistently called for such a policy and believe it would be a good addition to the fccs view of the internet
1361423 fcc chairman kevin martin deserves credit in this case for leading the commission to limit comcasts abuse of the internet
1361424 but commission decisions are only as permanent as the commissioners who voted for them and we are far from a point where we can all relax secure in the knowledge that the internet as we have always known it is safe more needs to be done the aclu will continue to work toward legislation that will free the internet from corporate censorship and the fleeting policy decisions that accompany a commission filled with political appointees
1361425 clogs bandwidth slows service and saddles legitimate internet users with higher prices
1361426 we are pleased that chairman martins statement affirms that the fccs order will not prevent isps internet service providers from using network management tools to block illegal content specifically including pirated video and music and that the fccs internet policy statement protects only lawful content
1361427 as commissioner deborah taylor tate emphasizes such theft harms content creators and costs the u s economy billions of dollars each year it will be critical for all stakeholders to work together to address the issue of illegal file distribution and reduce copyright theft
1361428 we really do live in a 24 7 society and its not uncommon to be online and checking email at all hours of the day

1361449 the social and professional opportunities in fort lauderdale are huge the real estate prices kept dropping and dropping it made it easier for me to afford
1361450 the first of the baby boomers are just barely over 60 now so over the next 10 or 15 years youll see a real increase in that group
1361451 lower housing prices could have some impact because historically florida has been a relatively low cost place to live but that has been going up in recent years
1361452 florida is going to face a very different racial and cultural gap as the older boomers age and the younger immigrants come with competing demands on public services
1361453 a lot of baby boomers will expect social services to be there for them and that wont be the case because funding hasnt kept pace with the need or demand

1361455 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
1361456 one of the things that we forget because it seems new to us again with dean and obama is the importance of small funders
1361457 if you look for example at carters 1976 campaign and reagans 1980 campaign you see campaigns that are very much built off of small contributions of 500 or below
1361458 i was a skeptic about the effectiveness of the internet
1361459 in the past the money from small contributions typically has been too little too late now you could almost manage a campaign off of these small internet driven contributions they are a major source of revenue
1361460 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury

1361765 i am highly skeptical of the web 2 0 hype there are two reasons for this one goes back to the issue of history web 2 0 is all about a generation change in the history of the web but from a perspective that is looking at what is happening right now as opposed to what was happening during the previous generational change the 1980s its not clear that we can really describe a generation change of this magnitude and complexity while we are in the midst of the change itself except to say that something is happening that a future generation may decide is qualitatively different after all when people speak of web 2 0 they are actually referring to a swarm of many kinds of new technologies and developments that are not all necessarily proceeding in the same direction for example toward decentralization open content creation and editing web as service ajax etc
1361766 its not at all certain for example that open content platforms in the style of blogs wikis and content management systems align with a philosophy of decentralized or distributed control since many such database or xml driven technologies require a priesthood of backend and middleware coders to create the underlying systems and templates for the new open communications just how many people in the world for example can make one of the current generation of open source content management systems which often start out as blog engines do anything that isnt on the model of post and category or chronological posting even the more trivial exercise of re skinning such systems with a fresh template requires a level of css knowledge that is not natural to the user base
1361767 web 2 0 is just a high tech set of waldo gloves or remote manipulators that tries to tap into the underlying social and cultural changes but really requires the complement of disciplined sociological communicational cognitive visual textual and other kinds of study that can get us closer to the actual phenomena i dont think there are many developers of web 2 0 technologies who have done the hard social and cultural studies to help them think about what they are developing they make a neat system or interface that only taps into some aspects of the social scene then if there are a lot of hits or users their system is said to be a paradigm but its hit or miss there is no assurance that such technologies are the real best coolest or even most useful face book or space of people only that they are the face book or space allowed to surface through a particular lash up of technologies

1361914 sometimes people sabotage the boat if they know youre coming to get it they take fuel they take parts
1361915 i remember years ago when we used to pick up a boat a day
1361916 people that have gotten into boating more recently are not as experienced and may not have realized the costs involved fuel is a big part of it marinas are charging 5 to 6 a gallon and youve got a 300 to 400 gallon tank

1361925 this does seem to be an example of systematic planned doping and under the new wada code that would mean an expanded ban of four years
1361926 the federation have done a very good job in revealing a very bad doping story which is just frustrating to find
1361927 its sad and very disappointing that this type of planned cheating is still going on
1361928 there is a due procedure for the russian federation to follow but the data is convincing and the dna analysis is 100 per cent
1361929 if the urine is proved to not be theirs then they certainly have a case to answer

1361954 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1361955 in the post 9 11 world you have to prepare and plan for all contingencies
1361956 that means preparing for everything from a minor disruption and an unruly individual to a broader terrorist event we need to plan for everything no matter what the threat level is on any particular day
1361957 because of the internet the ability of protesters to mobilize and share information has metastasized

1361961 fast fashion retailers have caused some cannibalization of sales in the luxury market
1361962 luxury retailers are losing some of the consumers who could actually afford their merchandise
1361963 shoppers are no longer caught up in the brand and image
1361964 they still love it and want it but are also into other non branded items
1361965 shoppers want something with legs that will carry them over a few seasons that is extremely well made and that they can dress down and up
1361966 they also want items they can wear over a few seasons by adding layers or taking away layers depending on the season classics with a twist are what the consumer is spending money on

1361978 when you read through the books there is no mention of islam allah or the koran
1361979 i used an islamic archetype but the actual stories dont show any islam because they are based on values that we all share
1361980 are based on religious archetypes like the prophets from the bible they are all orphans superman left his parents on the planet krypton and batman sees his father and mother gunned down in front of him
1361981 the goal is to teach children that there are 99 ways to solve a problem
1361982 even though there are approximately 50 female superheroes only five will be covered in that way
1361983 i want to send the message out that there is not only one way to be muslim
1361984 when you hear these stories of saddam hussein who was cast as a hero and then ended up torturing his own people you ask yourself what kind of message we are sending our kids about what a hero does
1361985 with the 99 i wanted to make a difference and give muslim kids positive role models
1361986 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1361987 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1361988 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1361989 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1361990 it is worth noting that separation resulting from sectarian cleansing was not the chief cause of the reduction in violence as some have claimed much of iraq remains intermingled but increasingly peaceful and whereas a cleansing argument implies that casualties should have gone down in baghdad for example as mixed neighborhoods were cleansed casualties actually went up consistently during the sectarian warfare of 2006 cleansing may have reduced the violence somewhat in some places but it was not the main cause
1361991 if an electoral crisis or some other event returns iraq to civil war it would be very hard to justify another troop surge to try to stabilize iraq containment withdrawing all u s troops while working to prevent the chaos in iraq from spilling over to the rest of the region would then become the united states only realistic option
1361992 china has become the biggest game development and art outsourcing market in recent years and we believe the market will continue to grow exponentially in the near future with the advanced technology and more than 350 talented developers ultizen has the potential to become the market leader in the industry
1361993 in addition the web based casual game industry has shown tremendous growth as an early mover in this segment we believe that ultizen will become a dominant player and moreover have great potential to expand from a developer into an influential publishing and operating company in this segment
1361994 ultizens leadership team lan haiwen and wu jun combines a deep knowledge of the gaming industry and the chinese game development market with a sophisticated understanding of the needs of game development and media companies around the globe
1361995 they have done an outstanding job of attracting and retaining the top talent needed to support rapid growth and address their clients skills and resource requirements while maintaining a high quality standard
1361996 ultizens track record of profitable growth is a validation of our capabilities and the top and bottom line business benefit our clients derive from partnering with us
1361997 the addition of pac link jaic and cyber agent to our investment team provides us with the resources to aggressively expand our leadership position among china based game development and outsourcing companies to address the huge market opportunity the thriving global gaming industry presents
1361998 fosters abbotsford brewery has a large migrant workforce and our members there have repeatedly called for its safety guidelines to be translated and explained in other languages
1361999 the extended viciousness and cruelty of this attack on christopher obrien almost defies belief
1362000 notwithstanding that knowledge you co operated in doing things aimed at protecting those who had killed obrien
1362001 chris was the most beautiful person to hear what actually happened in his last hours of life days of life is just so upsetting
1362002 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues
1362003 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1362004 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1362005 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1362006 her recovery will be a long process and she is getting all the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step of the way
1362007 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1362008 these new fees would not be based on cost recovery
1362009 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1362010 it could be half a per cent cut by christmas
1362011 in the present case we consider increases in the severity of storm events coupled with rising sea levels create a reasonably foreseeable risk of inundation of the subject land and the proposed dwellings which is unacceptable
1362012 there is a general consensus that some level of climate change will result in extreme weather conditions beyond the historical record that planners and others rely on
1362013 it is no longer sufficient to rely only on what has gone before to assess what may happen again in the context of coastal processes sea levels or for that matter inundation from coastal or inland storm events
1362014 to get an accurate picture and be able to compare between products the new pricing system would be a good idea
1362015 a lot of people are cost conscious these days and want to work out what is good value
1362016 i think the new pricing system will make it easier to work out what is good value and it will save time too
1362017 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1362018 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1362019 its something that we addressed do these players deserve to be part of the collingwood football club
1362020 we dont have any resolution on that and its something which will be evaluated at the end of the year
1362021 we supported the players to the hilt they panicked but they have to be shown their actions were unacceptable
1362022 i would have thought all the players would be there just focused on trying to make the four
1362023 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club asking questions
1362024 unfortunately we are focusing on two players who have made really poor decisions that have affected their behaviour and which i think they will regret for the rest of their lives
1362025 the vast majority of players do the right thing and clubs and their player leadership groups are taking responsibility for the individual actions of players

1362030 weve been providing ssc green audits for more than two years offering our small business clients a cost effective reliable way to assess their current environmental performance and identify ways to go green
1362031 now were offering consultants across the country the opportunity to learn our methodology and apply it with their own clients
1362032 one of the most valuable tools in our green audit arsenal is our ability to benchmark clients carbon footprints
1362033 instead of a seemingly random number of greenhouse gas emissions we can tell you how your company stacks up against other similar organizations that makes it easier to understand where you rank on the green scale and how much work you need to do
1362034 small businesses are hurting and the sba can help alleviate the strain of the current energy crisis
1362035 small businesses account for more than half of our fuel consumption and we should give them the tools to become more energy efficient whether its loans to purchase renewable energy systems or effective telecommuting programs every drop of oil or kilowatt of electricity saved is more money in a companys bottom line
1362036 i am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment
1362037 i firmly believe that long term coal will be a key component to global energy supply
1362038 it is a difficult but not impossible plan covering 15 years
1362039 this is a retrofit and a retrofit is a very different animal than a new green building anyone can build a new green building

1362045 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1362046 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1362047 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist

1362049 oh thats miss piggy she never speaks when you say hi to her she hates us

1362051 for once i am gobsmacked by this generosity i cant thank them enough after everything we have been through i was devastated but this has completely restored my faith in people
1362052 we went to see the solicitors for more legal advice because we intend to continue our fight against the pct and when i got there they told me it was a total bolt from the blue and i still cant quite believe it it is like a huge weight has been lifted off me
1362053 we are overwhelmed by this generosity we cannot thank them enough for giving us back some hope
1362054 we should not have to rely on a stranger to provide care which should be available on the nhs but they have done something amazing
1362055 throughout this experience we have had really good support from everyone else throughout this campaign our solicitor members of the public and the m e n we would like to thank them all
1362056 we are currently liaising with prof hawkins to arrange to start the course of treatment as soon as possible
1362057 the donation will not be enough to cover the cost of the treatment for the rest of her life but it will provide sufficient funding to begin her treatment
1362058 jean also wishes to thank the media and hopes that the injustices of nhs treatment funding will continue to be exposed

1362069 its about a girl who falls in love with a vampire
1362070 ooooooooooooooh theres a girl in my office whod love thayt is it like sci fi
1362071 like one of those fantasy books like a lord of the rings type of thing
1362072 i guess so i mean vampires dont really exist so
1362073 yeah its a quick read and i gestured to the book in my hand im buying the third book so yes i like them
1362074 oh no haha no its this book called um oh geez i dont even remember the name of it now
1362075 i think it was something called crystal castle anyway its about this girl who is terribly beaten by her father and she writes about all the abuse shes had to handle its such a sad book really gut wrenching then at the end you come to find out shes this news reporter for insert some news station because i cant remember what she said i mean really youre reading this book about all the awful things and at the end you expect her to be in jail or a total dead beat and then you find out that she actually made something of herself and is this great person
1362076 no need to now you just told me how it ends
1362077 i dont know you how would i know what book you read
1362078 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1362079 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1362080 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1362081 they took their eye off of their core customer and tried to go upscale they didnt attract enough new customers and turned off existing ones they have been significantly damaged
1362082 well sir its because lamictal has now gone generic and youre paying the difference between the cost of the medication and the cost of the generic
1362083 whats helped me is having really good friends i know i can rely on
1362084 cameron diaz is one of the greatest friend anyone can ever have she has so much love to give we also support each other through the bad times ive always felt like shes my big sister but at the same time i know that sometimes im wiser and a bit less naive than she is we just spend so much time having fun and laughing together thats what true friendship is about from star magazine print edition august 11 2008 star also has some more quotes from drew about her difficult childhood growing up with a mother who let her do whatever she wanted and a father who was losing his faculties from the way they work them into the article they seem like theyre from an old interview and i was able to find the original full quote but its unsourced ive never really understood how i should feel or behave in a relationship i didnt have the kind of childhood or family life that would have given me any perspective on what a happy home life or relationship would feel like my father was literally out of his mind and my mother was more like a friend than a real mom to me she would take me out to clubs and i wound up feeling like part of this very unreal kind of world although that was the only world i ever knew growing up

1362091 i found myself very much caring about these kids that were in our group they would come to me with their problems their life issues and i came to be almost a satanic pastoral counselor to them
1362092 i found myself caring and helping these kids along and the philosophy wasnt taking root i wasnt turning into this uncaring cold hearted human being that caused quite a wave in the group because they saw jeff is like this when theyre teaching us that there was a level of hypocrisy that caused internal conflict

1362095 with this acquisition corporate visions and cmm group will have literally bridged the gap between sales and marketing
1362096 our integrated solutions will truly be one of a kind and meet an increasing market demand
1362097 most companies have made an effort to identify their brand but continue to struggle with taking those messages to the streets
1362098 business clients are known to make brand purchase decisions based on their interactions with a companys field sales person so if you dont bridge your brand marketing messages into a customer focused message that can be delivered effectively by your sales people your brand efforts are at risk
1362099 we know thats a marketing and sales problem not just one or the other and weve come together to solve that issue
1362100 traditionally sales and marketing have worked in silos by combining corporate visions and cmm we will be able to provide a completely integrated solution that spans both departments focusing them on the same goal to make the most out of these powerful resources
1362101 both corporate visions and cmms clients were looking for vision and leadership in helping bring marketing and sales together
1362102 our clients were asking us to produce marketing messages and materials to reinforce the sales skills we are teaching cmms clients were asking them to provide sales training and ensure sales adoption of the messages and tools they developed as a result our traditional competencies were being pushed towards each other
1362103 now we are setting an example that sales and marketing really can be fused and were establishing an industry best practice for how the two should work together terry commented
1362104 if your company is looking to better integrate marketing and sales why not work with a consulting firm thats already done it themselves

1362174 we think this is because of the trends we have been speaking about for a couple of years now which not only continue but are accelerating specifically there are fewer players consolidation has a special effect on us also the supply and demand situation has moved in favor of supply which has had a positive pricing effect in the market and probably the most important trend is that of the adoption and accelerated conversion around an ip platform those are the trends playing into our order volume as for the macro economy we are watching that closely and we dont see those signs yet nor do we see any reason why these particular trends shouldnt continue
1362175 we may be moving from a 5 share to a 9 share of their business but they are not changing out their major carrier
1362176 in very specialized global ip applications a simple share shift is taking place the positive with that is that it doesnt create the same aggressive price competition or such a huge retaliation we are a small player and we can very quietly become a bigger player but not the dominant player thats a very lucrative business for us to be in

1362290 if you look at the increase in lithium prices over the past seven to 10 years its been dramatic
1362291 there are very limited global reserves and theyre in potentially very unstable parts of the world
1362292 that was the last time that an organisation got together to do that type of research
1362293 there is no surplus lithium carbonate available for the automotive market its all being used by existing industrial applications
1362294 tahils argument that the world is short of lithium carbonate is wrong
1362295 tahil considers that the total world lithium reserves are 4m tonnes
1362296 however sqms proven and probable in situ reserves alone total 5m tonnes

1362301 the whole fuel thing is a major public safety issue its a major economic issue
1362302 we put cops in very specific areas to keep them from driving around a lot and to be more efficient you just cant get away from answering calls most people dont have accidents or commit crimes in areas that are convenient to police

1362304 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
1362305 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
1362306 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
1362307 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
1362308 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030

1362320 i certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces as a prisoner of war and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility
1362321 he hasnt been there and ordered the bombs to fall he hasnt seen what its like when diplomats come in and say i dont know whether were going to be able to get this point through or not
1362322 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1362323 if barack obama wants to question john mccains service to his country he should have the guts to do it himself and not hide behind his campaign surrogates
1362324 if he expects the american people to believe his pledges about a new kind of politics barack obama has a responsibility to condemn these attacks clark getting shot down in plane doesnt make mccain qualified cnn com
1362325 can i have a few more napkins salt pepper and some butter
1362326 i like him hes young very active we would be very happy if he was elected president
1362327 any army would love to work without any help but let me be honest for now we dont have that ability
1362328 in no way do i favor the occupation of my country
1362329 but there is a moral obligation on the americans at this point
1362330 its a very big assumption that just because he wants to pull troops out hell be able to do it
1362331 the american strategy in the region requires troops to remain in iraq for a long time
1362332 every time i see obama i say hes close to us
1362333 thats why we expect that his tenure will be much better
1362334 of course i want the american forces to leave iraq
1362335 the americans paved the way for the iraqi army there
1362336 if they werent there the iraqi forces could not have taken control
1362337 al qaeda would rearrange itself and come back if the americans withdraw
1362338 i find it in germany and thats a strong country why not in iraq
1362339 the eyes of the nation and the world will soon be upon us and it is time for all of us to do our part to prepare to host this historic event
1362340 this is a tremendous opportunity for our cities as well as our residents who have the opportunity to not only spruce up our area but also to participate in several events that will be held in conjunction with the convention
1362341 china is already the worlds leading renewable energy producer and is over taking more developed economies in exploiting valuable economic opportunities creating green collar jobs and leading development of critical low carbon technologies
1362342 weve never manufactured anything ourselves as far as were concerned design is a two handed business in which we do the designing and someone else does the manufacturing
1362343 we must ensure that american companies operating in repressive regimes protect fundamental human rights
1362344 while the code of conduct is being finalized i urge american internet companies operating in repressive countries to do everything possible to resist censorship and protect user privacy and freedom of expression especially with the olympics beginning in china later this week
1362345 protecting and advancing the enjoyment of freedom of expression and privacy globally
1362346 the standard idea that you can pick a location throw money at it and attract the right kind of firms is a poor policy recipe a variety of factors have to align
1362347 por qu es malo que obama sea popular entre nuestros aliados en qu perjudica a la gente de misuri el que un americano sea recibido en berl n con aplausos en vez de con tomatazos

1362353 en la sangre de uno esta la vida de muchos
1362354 donar sangre es dar vida y constituye un acto solidario generoso y altruista
1362355 es un acto de solidaridad que no debe ser un gesto aislado sino permanente
1362356 desde el ministerio de educaci n se promueva la inclusi n en la curr cula de las escuelas y se ense e sobre el valor que representa

1362361 life did not smile much at me even as a child my father also a pastor was against my musical career at age 8 when i recognized my passion for singing after some tough time i finally set off because god is no respecter of persons no matter who you are he will definitely lead you to do what he has called you to
1362362 imagine the number of souls that would have been saved if that musician had sacrificed and taken a bus to the venue
1362363 if john mccain tires and falls asleep at the wheel of state itll be the whole country thatll end up in a ditch
1362364 smartesoft has a strong management team a compelling ip position and unique products that continue to gain traction in the market
1362365 they are another example of the experienced entrepreneurs we continue to see in our community and angel investors are tapping into these opportunities
1362366 i think it has to do with the fact that i am like smart
1362367 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
1362368 you know what they are provocateurs and thats fantastic but if they are so am i i think people are forgetting that im out there too doing that
1362369 se va a resolver entre hoy y ma ana nosotros hicimos los pedidos correspondientes en la afa aunque el de candia se podr a demorar un poco m s porque el permiso tiene que venir de m xico
1362370 esto se resuelva antes del viernes siempre hay demoras con estas cosas pero tambi n es cierto que se resuelven a tiempo
1362371 oooh but thats dirty politics we want to fight the campaign on issues not negative attacks
1362372 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1362373 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1362374 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1362375 in fact i met with oil executives just a few days ago in california and the fact is that we can using existing facilities expand our oil production within months according to these executives
1362376 in my view and that of oil company executives that ive talked to the people that actually do it not those that comment on television but those that actually do it we could in a very short time have a beneficial effect as we bridge the gap between our dependence on foreign oil and becoming energy independent
1362377 so i disagree with those experts and ive talked to the actual people that do the work that are in the business that say within months and certainly within a very short time we could have additional oil supply for this nation
1362378 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
1362379 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
1362380 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
1362381 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
1362382 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
1362383 the poor nature of our music sounds and videos has made most ghanaian musicians less respected on the african continent and beyond
1362384 they do this because they know they have nothing but chaff on compact disks and cassettes
1362385 as a result their songs are always attractive to the public
1362386 small cities and towns arts destinations based on a poll of readers of magazine
1362387 sure we have designed interactive sequences before but for things like museums and science exhibits
1362388 interactive technology has never been used in a touring environment before or in the rock show world
1362389 explaining the possibilities of the system and showing how we could create video content from audio input
1362390 he loved the fact that we were breaking new ground pushing the envelope in general he was extremely supportive but it was still quite a struggle to get it all right
1362391 there are so many parameters you have to worry about when dealing with nin
1362392 because they have such a precise and clearly defined visual aesthetic
1362393 is that the interactive material is self generated content rather than pre rendered material
1362394 in one interactive sequence trent moves towards the projection screens and a hollow opens around him but where that hollow is when it appears and how deep it goes all depends on what trent does at that individual performance
1362395 trent wanted to use the entire stage as a visual instrument that he could play
1362396 colours all look brighter when youre near the stars are all afire in the sky
1362397 he saw no connection between luis ramirezs violent death and his towns ordinance
1362398 town leaders have now heard about a number of incidents from mexican residents that were never reported
1362399 but i do believe that the inflammatory rhetoric in the immigration debate does have a correlation with increased violence against latinos
1362400 but i dont believe our ordinance had anything to do with it every person is responsible for their own actions
1362401 but maybe these are things that it is good that it came out
1362402 the art of losing isnt hard to master so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster
1362403 youd think after getting her wallet stolen last year she would know better
1362404 when something like that is stolen all the bad energy goes with it so let it go your daughter is fine thats the important thing
1362405 insist on joining cambodia as a bidder for the unesco designation
1362406 so i went for a scruffy big teasy thing that felt ladylike but a bit throwaway i think people respond to feminine ease and a sense of humour
1362407 i dont expect people to wear their hair exactly like that the catwalk shows or shoots just take note of say the dry texture or accept that a little bit of back combing is fine
1362408 at first when people saw it they were like he pulls a scared face but the more you do something the more familiar it becomes not long after designers were saying give me that matte texture it works so well with shiny fabrics
1362409 meeting fredyma was the beginning of my music career although before i met him i was already singing at church and at church crusades
1362410 i sing for the passion of it and to glorify my maker and for me this is very paramount before any other thing
1362411 mistakenly most people know me as a backing vocalist sort of but you know i dont blame them
1362412 i cant mention any number but i have worked with most of the top gospel musicians of today
1362413 it is purely a marketing problem and not the product content the strategy my management team put up just did not work here in ghana but it did very well in uk and elsewhere
1362414 i am a full blooded ewe and i love singing in my mother language but hey watch out i did something in hausa with ampong on his latest album
1362415 all christians serve the same god with one gospel the might be differences in ideologies as to the interpretations of certain doctrines the gospel must reach all nations all tribes and people
1362416 she is my big sis there is oneness that exists between our families we have much more respect for each other and she is a nice person to know
1362417 you are the greatest people on planet earth without your encouragement prayer and support i wouldnt being here my management is putting a show together for me to tell you my fans how much i think of you so please watch out
1362418 social security numbers credit card numbers and pins are examples of data that should never be compromised today there is an abundance of sensitive and eyes only information that needs to be contained within a secure it environment now more than ever linux system security should be at the top of every business and government agency it checklist

1362420 most people couldnt care less about the money when they come in
1362421 paw paw was a spectacular chow and an even more spectacular dog
1362422 exciting inspiration is all around us all we need is a knowing eye to recognize how we can adapt these off beat ideas to our own way of living theres always a place for a fresh idea somewhere in the home and its the part of decorating thats fun and unexpected

1362427 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

1362431 the contract award under this baa broad agency announcement in the area of 1 million over 3 years would be reasonable my regular communications with the customer letting this baa have resulted in a shared understanding of a need that no other proposer to this baa is likely to address the result is anyone that collaborates with me has a much better chance of winning

1362436 our attitude to defence particularly on our own line is something we have been talking constantly about
1362437 it was good against the cowboys but against the knights we let ourselves down again
1362438 i just spoke to the players about how they wanted to finish the year off and for those leaving how they wanted to finish up at this club
1362439 i just told them they all had decisions to make about how they wanted it to end thats basically all there is to say
1362440 its then down to the individual to decide how its played out
1362441 he is still contracted to huddersfield so its a matter of whether he is able to sort that out but he has expressed an interest in coming back for a year
1362442 republicans have been escalating their attacks on democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama ill and the democrats over oil drilling and we need to push back hard
1362443 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1362444 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1362445 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis
1362446 republicans have been dominating the debate around gas prices for weeks with their sham drilling plan
1362447 climate change is our generations greatest environmental challenge it threatens our economy our western way of life and our future it will change every facet of our existence and unless we address it the results will be catastrophic for generations to come

1362450 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1362451 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1362452 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1362453 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs

1362459 what research we do or not do in the first place
1362460 prudence demands that we consider what we might do if cuts in carbon dioxide emissions prove too little or too late to avoid unacceptable climate damage
1362461 mesoscale iron enrichment experiments 1993 2005 synthesis and future directions
1362462 computational models predict that a 10 percent decrease in stratospheric ozone could cause an additional 300 000 non melanoma and 4 500 melanoma skin cancers and between 1 6 and 1 75 million more cases of cataracts worldwide every year
1362463 the promise of geoengineering will delay the implementation of mitigation
1362464 until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities
1362465 the mount pinatubo eruption lofted more than enough aerosols into the atmosphere to compensate for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide yet ozone concentrations fell by only 3 percent and its believed that this small reduction was caused by chlorine from human made chlorofluorocarbons which are now banned by the montreal protocol so while the threat to the ozone layer is worth studying in greater detail its expected to diminish with time
1362466 that if geoengineering is ever implemented it must be geoengineering plus mitigation and never geoengineering instead of mitigation
1362467 the sensitivity of polar ozone depletion to proposed geoengineering schemes
1362468 we could avoid all of the potential consequences presumably adverse that we know about

1362479 in barbados they used to call the rum kill devil because it was so harsh
1362480 so i thought lets bring back the old time macho man pirate liquor
1362481 i walked out into the bar the other night and this guy was like i heard you looked like a pirate but seriously you look like a pirate
1362482 i do ive got the long hair beard tattoos the whole deal i had a pirate wedding everyone was dressed to the hilt there were swords everywhere and instead of you know a unity candle we had a mixing of the rum ceremony

1362485 its pretty damn awesome the way it is but we have five coconut heads hanging down off the ceiling in the bar right now and i want to have 500
1362486 but really this is exactly how i cook when im just having a good time my favorite thing in the summer is to go out on the river get up on an island make a campfire bring a makeshift grill prop it up and cook and thats what were doing here its just no pretensions good cooking

1362488 i have no doubts that when i line up next week on the start line i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1362489 that is such a disgrace ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1362490 that is not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1362491 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1362492 it is a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1362493 i was slammed from pillar to the post by the media for not making it past the first round and then i get this news that the girl just in front of me goes positive

1362567 supe que hab a sucedido algo irreparable en el momento en que un hombre me abri la puerta de esa habitaci n de hotel y vi a mi mujer sentada al fondo mirando por la ventana de muy extra a manera fue a mi regreso de un viaje corto s lo cuatro d as por cosas de trabajo dice aguilar y asegura que al partir la dej bien cuando me fui no le pasaba nada raro o al menos nada fuera de lo habitual ciertamente nada que anunciara lo que iba a sucederle durante mi ausencia salvo sus propias premoniciones claro est pero c mo iba aguilar a creerle si agustina su mujer siempre anda pronosticando calamidades l ha tratado por todos los medios de hacerla entrar en raz n pero ella no da su brazo a torcer e insiste en que desde peque a tiene lo que llama un don de los ojos o visi n de lo venidero y s lo dios sabe dice aguilar lo que eso ha trastornado nuestras vidas esta vez como todas mi agustina pronostic que algo saldr a mal y yo como siempre pas por alto su pron stico me fui de la ciudad un mi rcoles la dej pintando de verde las paredes del apartamento y el domingo siguiente a mi regreso la encontr en un hotel al norte de la ciudad transformada en un ser aterrado y aterrador al que apenas reconozco no he podido saber qu le sucedi durante mi ausencia porque si se lo pregunto me insulta hay que ver cu n feroz puede llegar a ser cuando se exalta me trata como si yo ya no fuera yo ni ella fuera ella intenta explicar aguilar y si no puede es porque l mismo no lo comprende la mujer que amo se ha perdido dentro de su propia cabeza hace ya catorce d as que la ando buscando y me va la vida en encontrarla pero la cosa es dif cil es angustiosa a morir y jodidamente dif cil es como si agustina habitara en un plano paralelo al real cercano pero inabordable es como si hablara en una lengua extranjera que aguilar vagamente reconoce pero que no logra comprender la trastornada raz n de mi mujer es un perro que me tira tarascadas pero que al mismo tiempo me env a en sus ladridos un llamado de auxilio que no atino a responder agustina es un perro fam lico y malherido que quisiera volver a casa y no lo logra y al minuto siguiente es un perro vagabundo que ni siquiera recuerda que alguna vez tuvo casa
1362568 el sol no hab a nacido todav a hubiera sido imposible distinguir el mar del cielo excepto por los mil pliegues ligeros de las ondas que le hac an semejarse a una tela arrugada poco a poco a medida que una palidez se extend a por el cielo una franja sombr a separ en el horizonte al cielo del mar y la inmensa tela gris se ray con grandes l neas que se mov an debajo de su superficie sigui ndose una a otra persigui ndose en un ritmo sin fin al aproximarse a la orilla cada una de ellas adquir a forma se hinchaba y se romp a arrojando sobre la arena un delgado velo de blanca espuma la ola se deten a para alzarse enseguida nuevamente suspirando como una criatura dormida cuya respiraci n va y viene inconscientemente poco a poco la franja oscura del horizonte se aclar se hubiera dicho un sedimento depositado en el fondo de una vieja botella dejando al cristal su transparencia verde en el fondo el cielo tambi n se hizo transl cido cual si el sedimento blanco se hubiera desprendido o cual si el brazo de una mujer tendida debajo del horizonte hubiera alzado una l mpara y bandas blancas amarillas y verdes se alargaron sobre el cielo igual que las varillas de un abanico enseguida la mujer alz m s alto su l mpara y el aire pareci dividirse en fibras desprenderse de la verde superficie en una palpitaci n ardiente de fibras amarillas y rojas como los resplandores humeantes de un fuego de alegr a poco a poco las fibras se fundieron en un solo fluido en una sola incandescencia que levant la pesada cobertura gris del cielo transform ndola en un mill n de tomos de un azul tierno la superficie del mar fue adquiriendo gradualmente transparencia y yaci ondulando y despidiendo destellos hasta que las franjas oscuras desaparecieron casi totalmente el brazo que sosten a la l mpara se alz todav a m s lentamente se alz m s y m s alto hasta que una inmensa llama se hizo visible un arco de fuego ardi en el borde del horizonte y a su alrededor el mar ya no fue sino una sola extensi n de oro la luz golpe sucesivamente los rboles del jard n iluminando una tras otra las hojas que se tornaron transparentes un p jaro gorje muy alto hubo una pausa m s abajo otro p jaro repiti su gorjeo el sol utiliz las paredes de la casa y se apoy como la punta de un abanico sobre una persiana blanca el dedo del sol marc sombras azules en el arbusto junto a la ventana del dormitorio la persiana se estremeci dulcemente pero todo en la casa continu siendo vago e insustancial afuera los p jaros cantaban sus vac as melod as

1362570 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

1362811 la talpa non un reality come gli altri forse non neanche un reality e un grande giallo popolare un intrigo divertente e spettacolare diciamo cos in salsa di hitchcock si tratta per i partecipanti e per gli spettatori di utilizzare intelligenza e fiuto per scoprire chi sia il sabotatore occulto o la sabotatrice che vuol far fallire la prova dei compagni in scena gli indizi sono disseminati ovunque ma ci vorr il naso di un investigatore per metterli insieme anche se credo che la verit come sempre si scoprir solo allultima puntata

1362813 a proposito di format la settimana enigmistica non soltanto il giornale che vanta innumerevoli tentativi dimitazione ma anche unoccasione continua di spunti di suggerimenti di idee prendiamo reazione a catena il game show estivo condotto da pupo e scritto da stefano santucci tonino quinti e francesco ricchi ebbene pare proprio di sfogliare il noto settimanale basati su giochi con le parole gli enigmi si sciolgono attraverso sinonimie analogie contrasti attinenze modi di dire secondo il meccanismo classico della concatenazione raiuno dal luned al sabato ore 18 50 la prima impressione che se al posto di pupo ci fosse un conduttore che ha dimestichezza con le parole penso a gian luigi beccaria di parola mia con le loro origini e le loro trasformazioni raiuno potrebbe finalmente vantare un programma culturale ma evidentemente le intenzioni non sono queste limportante battere la concorrenza eppure non possiamo fare a meno di citare il grande emilio cecchi che nel 1925 nellarticolo puzzle pubblicato sul quotidiano il secolo di milano descrive la forza dincanto dei giochi con le parole qualcosa di semplicissimo e formidabile il gusto della parola necessaria la luminosa attrazione delle idee innate il senso di poter fare dentro di s infinite scoperte mediante la chimica del crittogramma la poesia delle innumerevoli associazioni il decoro architettonico di eleganti e inaspettate identit qui pi modestamente ci troviamo di fronte a squadre che si chiamano gli sfigatti gioco di parole o le sardelle facile intuire la regione di provenienza eppure ci sono momenti in cui si capisce perfettamente come ogni parola racchiuda in s una piccola commedia o tragedia vogliosa di mettersi in scena
1362814 reazione a catena una mattanza di parole della lingua italiana non si banalizzano linguaggio e schemi della comunicazione ma li si semplifica un po per esigenze di tempi televisivi proponendo un quiz piuttosto intelligente e non troppo perduto tra le ore di meditazione dei concorrenti le infinite attese per sapere se una risposta esatta e soprattutto senza fantasticare sulla vita privata dei concorrenti pupo pur essendo teso e poco disinvolto rispetto ad altre apparizioni ottiene buoni risultati nel lavoro di conduzione in sottrazione basta farlo tacere quando si parla di poker donne e soldi ambito in cui si crede unico conoscitore sullemisfero boreale
1362815 difficile per chi aveva un conato ogni volta che accennava gelatooo al cioccolato dolce e un po salatooo accettare che pupo occupi ormai il ruolo di presentatore di raiuno ma lass inspiegabilmente qualcuno lo ama e dunque eccolo a reazione a catena per coloro che nei dintorni della cena non riescono a digerire senza quiz e giochi a premi scemi nella fattispecie reazione a catena potrebbe per la sua struttura far a meno pure degli inutili commenti di un conduttore ma tant a pupo lass qualcuno lo ama giusto qualcuno

1362861 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1362862 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1362863 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1362864 this is leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk of increasing relative poverty
1362865 one out of every three women is underweight which puts them at risk of having low birth weight babies these babies are 20 times more likely to die in infancy than healthy babies
1362866 the police tried various ways to disperse them but had to resort to firing later in which 10 protesters were injured one of them critically

1362868 they could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger
1362869 the formulation of any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion
1362870 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1362871 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1362872 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp
1362873 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1362874 to ensure that such obviously unsuitable individuals are no longer selected as conservative candidates
1362875 it was inappropriate he was lonely at the time and that was the only way he knew to communicate but he said he has learnt from that and he wont be doing that kind of thing again its a case of self policing for barry he now realises it is wrong
1362876 tasers are making a real difference on our streets not only keeping the public safe but also protecting our police officers
1362877 and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear to me the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1362878 we are very very worried about the intentions of a number of hardcore protesters which we believe are around 150 who are committed to using criminal means to achieve their aims
1362879 that many title companies shut down in the same week
1362880 im glad that we use more than one title company so we can easily switch from one to another
1362881 any of the firms statements concerning its balance sheet over the past year have simply not matched with subsequent actions by the company
1362882 one might assume that if these mortgages decline further in value that merrill might risk a default on its 5 0 billion loan thus it is hard to argue that these loans are off merrills books
1362883 right now we believe we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
1362884 when we said we werent going to raise more capital we said we were adequately capitalized at that point in time
1362885 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
1362886 we have more capital than we need so we can say to the market that we dont need more injections we can confirm that we have tackled the problem
1362887 we have plenty of capital going forward and we dont need to come back into the equity market the goal is to maintain our current ratings no more capital raising im sure we have enough capital
1362888 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
1362889 the dividend on the common stock is clearly a burden to the company
1362890 with an estimated 1 365 million shares outstanding it now costs close to 500 million per quarter
1362891 there seems to be little merit in continuing to make this expenditure
1362892 has been increased to 7 87 per share from 5 31 per share
1362893 2009 estimate of profit has been lowered to 2 40 per share from 3 03 per share
1362894 the biggest issue for this firm however continues to be where will the new profits come from
1362895 the answer to this question remains difficult to discern since most of the key revenue drivers of the past few years do not look very strong at all

1362975 i got lots of calls from athletes and coaches basically ready to go
1362976 they said i want to be injected it sounds great they all picked up on the fact the approach was undetectable from a testing standpoint
1362977 to that point i was naive about the way athletes feel about these things

1362979 an amazing atmosphere the partner appreciation is genuine and the excitement contagious as a shoretel circle of excellence partner we are amongst the top ten of all shoretel partners based on customer satisfaction cri is passionate about the satisfaction of our customers and we truly appreciate how shoretels customer service focus parallels our own
1362980 this award is a result of the dedication and effort of each and every cri employee and is attributed to a team who dedicated themselves in reaching this achievement
1362981 we have the most amazing group of professionals working with us and one of the proudest moments of my business career was accepting this award on behalf of them at cri team stands for together everyone achieves more and this award proves it
1362982 the decision for cri to adopt the shoretel product and solutions set has been a delightfully easy one for me
1362983 our diligence in investigating and analyzing both the products and shoretel has revealed nothing but solid performance and commitment to the market needs and to delivering end user value shoretel is focused on developing strategic unified communications solutions this is all they do and they are committed to delivering best in class solutions that are easy to manage
1362984 we feel that we now have a cost effective and easy to manage solution for any customer environment
1362985 the addition of the shoretel portfolio and other network support services has already created the need for five additional support engineers
1362986 the total cost of ownership tco of a shoretel unified communications uc system is much lower than many other ip telephone systems in an economic climate where customers are constantly looking for ways to save money we see more and more clients choosing to implement a shoretel uc system because of both the short term and long term savings
1362987 this is my personal decision i have decided now is a good time to go to pastures new we have brought the two businesses together and i have got a new baby so now seems the right time to take a break
1362988 in light of dereks departure we need to decide our next steps and these decisions are still being made

1363000 i strongly feel that independent tour operators will have a greater role to play in the future of the travel industry as consumers become more and more selective about their holiday choices the independent tour operator customer relationship will continue to grow in importance as knowledge security and value for money become key elements in consumers holiday considerations
1363001 its a tough market for overseas breaks at the moment but agents have responded to the change in customer demand and are really pushing uk holidays
1363002 we have received some complaints and we are looking into them at the moment
1363003 grave concerns about the potential for inaccurate irresponsible and defamatory allegations being published on the website

1363010 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1363011 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1363012 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1363013 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

1363016 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1363017 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1363018 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1363117 this quarter fewer than 5 of companies in the s amp p 500 can boast this triple whammy beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising guidance
1363118 ironically while most of the other triple whammy stocks enjoyed hefty single and double digit run ups on the announcements yum sold off
1363119 and heres where i think most investors are missing the boat and once again focusing too heavily on the short term yes yums in a pinch food costs are rising and consumers are spending less
1363120 in other words margins are getting squeezed and the company like most others isnt about to raise prices for fear of destroying more demand but margins are only off about 1 across all divisions hardly an amount to panic about
1363121 moreover sales are still increasing at double digit rates so even if yums making a little less on each one pound burrito at taco bell or variety bucket at kfc net profits are still increasing
1363122 not to mention this margin contraction is a short term phenomenon weve already seen commodity prices pull back and this will continue the more demand lightens up bottom line sooner than later yum will get out of this pinch
1363123 even if the margin pressure persists a little longer than we expect it will do little to undermine the long term fundamentals working in the companys favor namely international expansion for six years running yums added at least a thousand new international locations
1363124 ceo david novak expects 2008 to be no different in fact worldwide he expects the company to open 1 600 new units thats 4 4 per day making yum the fastest growing retailer in the world
1363125 of course growth in china is propelling this massive expansion operating profits for yums china division alone jumped 38 in the most recent quarter and it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future
1363126 with only 2 726 china locations yums still in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs of a tremendous growth story management estimates that china can conservatively support 20 000 locations thats the equivalent of 36 more years of growth at current rates
1363127 and when you tack on a massive 4 billion stock repurchase program a five year average return on equity of 60 a dividend thats quadrupled in four years a non cyclical industry world class leadership and new efforts to reignite same store sales in the united states i have little reservations recommending this stock
1363128 financials have staged an impressive rally from extremely oversold levels
1363129 i think the fundamentals behind chinas real estate market are terrific
1363130 econopower how a new generation of economists is transforming the world
1363131 some investors will rightfully cringe from any mention of this sector after all the airlines have consistently lost money throughout their post deregulation history
1363132 most of the majors have declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions since that time however weve traded the airlines on a few occasions we took some triple digit percentage gains in the airlines back in 2005
1363133 the airlines leverage to oil prices is well known expectations are so low in fact that several major air carriers actually managed to beat consensus expectations in the second quarter
1363134 and although sentiment is already at rock bottom theres a real basis for cautious optimism first if im right about oil fuel costs wont rise appreciably in the third quarter this huge headwind is dissipating
1363135 my two favorite airlines for a trade are us airways and delta air lines delta reported a 1 billion loss in the second quarter but that includes a 1 1 billion noncash accounting charge known as goodwill impairment
1363136 if we net that out delta actually posted a small profit quite frankly thats amazing given the more than 100 jump in fuel costs the carrier has experienced over the past year
1363137 delta is also in the process of merging with northwest airlines

1363143 wenn haider das geld nicht endlich frei gibt m ssen die bauern dank haider und scheuch jahrelang auf die entsch digungen warten
1363144 die antr ge liegen vor die bauern erwarten sich die zugesagte hilfe das bz l sst die landwirte einmal mehr im regen stehen
1363145 mit der einigung auf eine 100 privatisierung der sterreichischen airline steht ein weiteres sterreichisches kernunternehmen zum vollst ndigen ausverkauf auf die tausenden besch ftigten der aua wartet eine unsichere zukunft immerhin haben vollprivatisierungen bisher immer zu besch ftigungsverlusten gef hrt
1363146 von der bewahrung staatlicher einflussm glichkeiten kann bei diesem kompromiss keine rede sein es wurde lediglich auf die interessen sterreichischer investoren r cksicht genommen die interessen der besch ftigten bleiben auf der strecke
1363147 die erfahrung der letzten jahre hat gezeigt dass sich finanzminister die der neoliberalen wirtschaftslogik folgen nur mit einer vollprivatisierung zufrieden geben
1363148 die aua wird nur dann im interesse der sterreichischen bev lkerung fliegen wenn sie auch in staatlichem teilbesitz bleibt
1363149 die gr nen sollten sinnvolle infrastrukturma nahmen zum wohle des landes und der bev lkerung nicht schlecht zu reden denn mit ihrer ahnungslosigkeit bringen sie uns in der mobilit t auch nicht weiter
1363150 aber ginge es nach den gr nen w rden auch keine stra en mehr gebaut werden um die regionen zu entlasten daher sollten sie sich besser weiterhin den internen grabenk mpfen in der partei widmen
1363151 privatisierung bis zu 100 mit sterreichischer kernaktion rsstruktur m glich
1363152 wichtiger schritt f r zukunftssicherung der aua der arbeitspl tze und des standortes
1363153 das ist guter weg der die rot wei roten interessen sicherstellt mit dieser verantwortungsvollen wirtschaftlichen entscheidung die die zukunfts sicherung der aua der drehscheibe wien schwechat sowie der damit verbundenen arbeitspl tze sicherstellt ist es gelungen dieses zentrale standortthema aus dem wahlkampf herauszuhalten klar ist eine privatisierung der aua ist bis zu 100 prozent m glich wenn eine sterreichische kernaktion rsstruktur gesichert ist das gibt den verantwortlichen organen die notwendige flexibilit t f r einen offenen privatisierungsprozess
1363154 wir haben klare ziele definiert es muss die marke aua sowie die unternehmens entscheidungszentrale in sterreich erhalten bleiben gleichzeitig geht es um eine dem standort angemessene aufrechterhaltung des streckennetzes sowie um die bestm gliche erhaltung sicherer jobs bei der aua und am wiener flughafen insgesamt betrifft das zehntausende mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeiter
1363155 jetzt folgt ein offener prozess mit einem bieterverfahren die profis der iag sind am zug

1363157 jetzt das lkh klagenfurt welches krankenhaus muss als n chstes zittern wir lassen es nicht zu dass das k rntner spitalswesen einen selbsternannten sheriff zum opfer f llt

1363159 damit wird erstmals die operative leitung der dachorganisation des sterreichischen sports einer frau bertragen das ist ein deutliches signal an und f r den sterreichischen sport
1363160 die sterreichische bundes sportorganisation steht vor gro en herausforderungen ich bin mir sicher dass mit barbara spindler die richtige person f r die vielschichtigen aufgaben der bundessportorganisation ausgew hlt wurde
1363161 walter pillwein hat immer ein offenes ohr f r seine verb nde und ihre anliegen gehabt der sterreichische sport hat ihm viel zu verdanken und ich w nsche ihm f r seine zukunft alles alles gute
1363162 dank werner faymann bleibt dem sterreichischen flaggschiff aua eine total verscherbelung erspart
1363163 dass jetzt ein weg gefunden wurde mit dem die interessen sterreichs und vor allem jene der rund 8000 arbeitnehmerinnen im auge behalten werden k nnen ist jedenfalls nicht den herren tsch und michaelis zu verdanken monatelang ist gar nichts passiert au er dass die beiden hochdotierten manager eine 100 ige privatisierung ohne wenn und aber wollten es mutet mehr als seltsam an dass eine l sung f r so ein parade unternehmen wie der aua nur dank der nachhilfe von der politik zustande kommt

1363179 we could see 100 in the next two months at the rate were falling
1363180 short of problems in the middle east or hurricanes i think were going to continue to fall
1363181 i think below 100 could be a possibility in the next two months
1363182 its dropped nearly 30 so far from the highs so its only got to go another 18

1363199 if theres one sector that stands to benefit handsomely from a further slide in oil or at least a moderation in crudes rally the airlines
1363200 airlines may make a terrible long term investment but can be an outstanding short term trade
1363201 some investors will rightfully cringe from any mention of this sector after all the airlines have consistently lost money throughout their post deregulation history
1363202 most of the majors have declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions since that time however weve traded the airlines on a few occasions we took some triple digit percentage gains in the airlines back in 2005
1363203 the airlines leverage to oil prices is well known expectations are so low in fact that several major air carriers actually managed to beat consensus expectations in the second quarter
1363204 and although sentiment is already at rock bottom theres a real basis for cautious optimism first if im right about oil fuel costs wont rise appreciably in the third quarter this huge headwind is dissipating
1363205 meanwhile the major carriers are finally taking real steps to address pathetic profitability the most important step is capacity rationalization and restructuring the air carriers are retiring older planes and permanently ending service for certain routes
1363206 the us airline industry has too many planes flying over too many routes there just arent enough passengers to make this model profitable reducing capacity lowers operating costs and brings service in line with passenger volumes
1363207 and anyone whos flown recently knows the major air carriers are all instituting extra fees and charges including checked baggage fees and a few extra dollars for that bloody mary on your flight home from las vegas
1363208 airlines are also replacing inefficient decades old airplanes with newer more fuel efficient planes such as the boeing 787 dreamliner
1363209 my two favorite airlines for a trade are us airways and delta air lines delta reported a 1 billion loss in the second quarter but that includes a 1 1 billion noncash accounting charge known as goodwill impairment if we net that out delta actually posted a small profit
1363210 quite frankly thats amazing given the more than 100 jump in fuel costs the carrier has experienced over the past year
1363211 delta is aggressively cutting costs and reducing capacity the companys debt is 2 42 times its equity for almost any business that would be considered pathetic except for the airlines
1363212 delta has 1 billion in undrawn capacity on its credit lines and 3 3 billion in unrestricted cash the company isnt going bankrupt any time soon
1363213 delta is also in the process of merging with northwest airlines
1363214 please be advised that buying airlines is extremely risky you should only take this trade if youre willing to assume a far higher than average risk and are ready to treat it as a trade not an investment
1363215 for the even more adventurous theres us airways like delta you could argue that us airways was actually profitable or close to it in the second quarter if we exclude noncash charges us airways will also benefit from lower fuel costs and sharply falling capacity

1363579 i think it is a uniform of sorts for the guy who has good taste but doesnt want the label of wearing a label it is extremely comfortable so you can feel as though you are put together but maintain the feeling of wearing khakis and a t shirt this for me is key because so often designer stuff is a burden to actually wear every day unwieldy buttons awkwardly placed pockets for example

1363592 once customers are at your web site make it easy for them to navigate ask every single employee to spend time at the companys web site and then take all their feedback and improve what customers are experiencing
1363593 blogs are extremely important to monitor because they are opinionated conversations being conducted its almost overwhelming but monitoring helps

1363711 recent empirical research suggests that total driving or vehicle miles traveled vmt is not currently very responsive to the price of gasoline a 10 percent increase in gasoline prices is estimated to reduce vmt by as little as 0 2 percent to 0 3 percent in the short run and by 1 1 percent to 1 5 percent eventually 1
1363712 b ecause recent research indicates that vmt is relatively insensitive to gasoline prices the higher prices of the past several years should not be expected to cause large changes in freeway traffic volume
1363713 on average over all locations the price of gasoline in a given week had a negligible effect on the volume of weekend traffic but on weekdays higher gasoline prices had a small but statistically significant effect see table 1 1
1363714 the value of the potential fuel savings from slowing down is rather small compared with reasonable measures of many motorists value of time so the likely effect of gasoline prices on highway speeds also should be rather small
1363715 the development of freeway congestion pricing projects which charge tolls that rise with the amount of traffic congestion has enabled researchers to estimate motorists value of time during congested commuting hours estimates for californias high occupancy toll lanes along state route 91 west of riverside and interstate 15 north of san diego indicate on the basis of tolls and travel time savings in toll lanes versus free lanes that motorists value their time between 20 and 45 per hour of reduced travel time 9
1363716 if the speeds at which motorists drive are positively correlated with how much they value their time then a disproportionate number of slower driving motorists would have lower than average values of time and faster driving motorists would have higher values if that is the case then the findings of the congressional budget office cbo about the effects of the price of gasoline on highway speeds are consistent with the prediction that motorists with lower values of time will be more responsive to an increase in gasoline prices than will drivers with higher values of time
1363717 higher gasoline prices from 2003 through the end of 2006 caused many motorists to drive a little more slowly on uncongested highways median speeds in free flow conditions declined slightly as gasoline prices increased the slowdown was more pronounced for vehicles moving at the somewhat lower 5th percentile speeds there was no discernible effect on 95th percentile speeds the median effect is consistent with recent estimates of gasoline price elasticity which indicate that short run demand declines by around 0 6 percent when the price rises by 10 percent all else being equal 19
1363718 recent empirical research suggests that total driving or vehicle miles traveled vmt is not currently very responsive to the price of gasoline

1363834 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways

1363836 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief

1363847 there is more data being distributed and companies want consistent data protection strategies
1363848 this eliminates issues with backup windows and provides near instant recovery
1363849 they scaled down the comprehensive offering but the tsm express really didnt meet the need as it was still hefty to manage
1363850 they have the formula for taking in technology they acquire and getting it rolled out in an impressive time frame

1363866 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1363867 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1363868 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1363869 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1363870 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1363871 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1363872 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1363887 these preliminary data are released upon our being advised that the trial has now reached the point at which more than 50 of the patients have died the overall survival os and disease control rate dcr for patients receiving nimotuzumab compare well with published results in similar patient populations treated with cetuximab a currently marketed egfr monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab also continues to display a safety profile unequalled in its class this low incidence of toxicity with nimotuzumab may be related to differences reported in its interaction with egf receptors compared with other egfr targeting antibodies
1363888 the median overall survival of 9 3 months and disease control rate of 50 together with the exceptional safety profile of nimotuzumab support continuing development of nimotuzumab in patients with colorectal cancer
1363889 the results support further development of nimotuzumab in this setting and trials in metastatic colorectal cancer are high on the list of indications that ym and its licensees plan to develop initially however ym will concentrate on those indications where nimotuzumab can complete pivotal trials in the shortest time within its available resources we intend to file for registration trials in 2008 for patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and for those with brain metastases because of compelling observations in phase ii trials in those indications and because they require shorter development times than colorectal trials would require
1363890 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups

1363894 ubs analyst maynard um today launched coverage of the pc sector setting a buy rating on apple aapl and neutral ratings on dell dell and hewlett packard hpq
1363895 um takes over coverage of the stocks from ben reitzes who now covers the sector for lehman
1363896 with 195 price target um says he expects new macs new iphone colors and potentially new ipods early in the second half of the calendar year he says a new ultra portable mac and a new iphone are coming in the first half of 09 um says that the beat and raise story is still intact and that gross margin guidance for fy 2009 may prove conservative he sees profits of 6 09 a share in the september 2009 fiscal year and 7 25 in fy 2010

1363898 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers
1363899 that means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad skipping
1363900 it allows advertisers to do things they cant do on a physical dvr

1363902 dont look now but apple mac hardware and the accompanying os x 10 x operating system software are gaining significant momentum among corporate users
1363903 a new independent yankee group web based survey of 750 global it administrators and c level executives found that nearly four out of five businesses approximately 80 have macs and the os x operating system installed in their networks and although the apple mac hardware and os x operating systems still represent a small niche adoption and acceptance of mac hardware and operating system software are growing at a steady and sustained pace not seen since the late 1980s
1363904 the responses to the yankee group 2008 2009 apple mac and os x 10 corporate enterprise deployment and usage survey indicate the use of apple products in a corporate environment is much more pervasive and complex than previously thought nearly one quarter or close to 25 of the survey respondents have a significant number greater than 30 or 50 of apple macs and os x 10 x os software present in their corporate networks

1363913 shake off all the fears of servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched fix reason firmly in her seat and call on her tribunal for every fact every opinion question with boldness even the existence of a god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear
1363914 after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet sparkling with colour bountiful with life within decades we must close our eyes again isnt it a noble an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it this is how i answer when i am asked as i am surprisingly often why i bother to get up in the mornings to put it the other way round isnt it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born who with such a thought would not spring from bed eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be a part of it

1363917 my conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and further that there is no reason to wish that they were true man in so far as he is not subject to natural forces is free to work out his own destiny the responsibility is his and so is the opportunity
1363918 the method of science is tried and true it is not perfect its just the best we have and to abandon it with its skeptical protocols is the pathway to a dark age

1363973 using new antiretroviral drugs correctly today including hiv integrase inhibitors is critically important since the pipeline for additional new agents is not likely to provide treatment options beyond our current choices for a number of years
1363974 tools like hiv resistance phenotype tests including monograms phenosense integrase and phenosense gt assays and the hiv tropism assay trofile are important tools to help clinicians make good choices they can also help with modifying regimens that are not suppressive by determining whether additional resistance has emerged and which drugs are no longer active

1363980 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true

1363982 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality

1363986 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand

1363992 while we were finishing uncharted we were already thinking ahead to some kind of trophy system for the playstation network so we created the medal system where players could win medals for making certain amazing accomplishments in the game whether it was getting three enemies with a single grenade or stealth killing five dudes from behind and so on
1363993 so when the cross media bar trophy system was announced and we got the development code for it it was super easy for us to dovetail our medal system with the trophy system and before we knew it we had it working
1363994 this is our medal system in uncharted so he has just killed three enemies with one grenade he gets the dyn o might medal we hooked it up so that a few seconds after you get the medal you get the trophy notification in order to get this you have to download the patch so you go to the psn site and patch uncharted then you can win trophies for any medal that you havent yet unlocked
1363995 just thinking of the span of biblical history we think of warriors patriarchs prophets mighty men of valor we think of the apostles and the early christian martyrs we not only know that the word courage is found in scripture in many forms but we also know that courage is demonstrated by gods people again and again courage is a hermeneutical key to understand the flow of biblical history in the experience of gods chosen people

1364005 when nbc covers the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics aug 8 the u s team will march into the new stadium and will likely refuse to dip its flag to chinas leaders
1364006 nbcs commentators will explain that the u s is following a tradition began in 1908 but the tv people will be wrong about the history of this particularly important display of american nationalism at the olympics
1364007 while the u s team did in fact refuse to dip its flag in 1908 at the first ever parade of nations the u s team dipped the stars and stripes in 1912 1924 and 1932 indeed a consistent tradition of not dipping the flag at olympic opening ceremonies did not develop until 1936 when at both the winter and summer games the u s refused to lower its national banner to adolph hitler
1364008 the motives for the original refusal the identity of the flag bearer and the truth behind the quotation and other issues remain much murkier in the historical record than legend tellers portray
1364009 the evolution of this flag mythology reveals a great deal about the complex strains of early 20th century american nationalism
1364010 however in 1936 the american teams refusal was unquestionably a referendum on adolf hitler and nazi germany
1364011 most of the athletics and much of the american public agreed that they would engage the third reich in athletic contests but would not dip the flag to hitler nor embrace the nazi regime
1364012 after 1936 the united states would never again dip the stars and stripes at an olympic games
1364013 as the cold war emerged from the debris of the second world war the idea became so strong that even opponent avery brundage who eventually moved through the u s olympic committee to became president of the international olympic committee could not change the tradition
1364014 we want to be good world citizens a dip demonstrates a little humility

1364044 we are concerned that at a time when tbi is recognized as the signature wound of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan one of the most widely accepted and critical rehabilitative treatments for this injury known as cognitive rehabilitation therapy is excluded by the militarys tricare health insurance program
1364045 given the prevalence of tbi among returning service personnel it is difficult to comprehend why the militarys managed healthcare plan does not cover the very therapies that give our soldiers the best opportunities to recover and live full and productive lives
1364046 i was an obama guy in the primaries i remember hearing dr kings i have a dream speech when i was 7 but i never thought id see an african american with an opportunity to win the presidency so this has been stunning to me i havent made up my mind but im definitely leaning toward obama

1364063 if they vote to keep or eliminate it ill take that as the will of the people
1364064 we are taking some pretty major steps to prepare for that

1364074 spirituality refers to what matters most spiritual experience is central to our lives
1364075 by the spiritual i mean an encompassing significance or meaning within which our lives are lived wittingly or unwittingly and against which all other significances and meanings are of a lower order
1364076 psychotherapy is a process whereby man becomes his organism without self deception without distortion
1364077 when man is less than fully man when he denies to awareness various aspects of his experience then indeed we have all too often reason to fear him and his behavior
1364078 it is now common for people to present themselves to therapists with concerns that they themselves have categorised as specifically spiritual in nature

1364090 this reformed tradition comes to the fore in my re evaluation of violence as something that is not inherently negative in my insistence that boundaries can function as wholesome ways and need at times to be defended as well as in my argument that restorative justice can only function if we are willing to include the notion of punishment boersma 2004 p
1364091 the exclusionary practice of the christian church the violent suppression of internal dissentees throughout its history and the collusion of the churc with the sword of the state all seem to illustrate the fact that violence not hospitality lies at the heart of the church
1364092 put provocatively gods hospitality in christ needs an edge of violence to ensure the welcome of humanity and all creation p 93
1364093 a tragic view of reality can hardly uphold non violence as an absolute or nonnegotiable standard but would have have to recognize that violence lies at the heart of things and cannot possibly be avoided p 199
1364094 the mainline christian churches still teach something that christ never taught or even hinted at namely the just war theory a theory that to me has been completely discredited theologically historically and psychologically
1364095 the limitation of eucharist hospitality to those who are bartised indicates again that the church boundaries that the churchs hospitality cannot be absolute if the church wants to remain the chiurch
1364096 confession and penance constitute one of the ways in which the church safeguards and protects its character as a hospitable community

1364098 the phrase god is love is not one more slogan which we can tack on to the end of other thingswe know about god and which we can brandish when we feel like it

1364137 although weve worked continually to enhance efficiencies and increase productivity in all areas of our business these efforts can not fully mitigate the escalation of costs that were facing as a result we have no choice but to implement this price increase

1364216 the police are empowered to immediately arrest shopkeepers if they find any gta grand theft auto games on sale
1364217 gta is banned mainly because of its obscene content under the criminal law article 287 that prohibits reproduction distribution or possession of such material

1364266 while it was slightly better than expected it is still obviously weak it is still below 50 it has been below 50 for five out of seven months it doesnt really show any improvement in the economy
1364267 the government should not be trying to bribe people into buying homes in a falling market
1364268 with the economy grinding to a halt we are likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make the situation worse
1364269 the falls we are seeing in the housing market are painful if necessary if homes are to become affordable for those not on the property ladder
1364270 if it helps to kick start some activity in our moribund housing market
1364271 the government needs to think more strategically about reforming stamp duty so that it better supports people moving and encourages institutions to invest in housing supply
1364272 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1364273 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1364274 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems

1364277 the possibility of running virtual servers on top of x86s so the hardwares not fully tasked with running the storage is what makes this interesting
1364278 its similar to cisco allowing virtual server instances to run on top of its waas appliance to reduce hardware requirements

1364286 it seems theyre expanding the market for clariion whenever and wherever they can
1364287 but in the long run if youre emc you have to be concerned about the number of platforms youre supporting
1364288 we got the same question when we came out with the cx3
1364289 capacity is just one piece of the overall package symmetrix has a very different architecture from clariion
1364290 but symmetrixs dynamic cache controls allow high end customers to meet performance requirements in multiple ways its at a different level from clariions quality of service
1364291 i dont have an architectural answer for that right now
1364292 id like to go with a dmx for the performance
1364293 the price performance isnt quite there for me yet though the acquisition cost is too high
1364294 no one can afford dmx though the average life of a dmx is two to three times greater than clariion the clariion only lasts between three and five years while there are still symmetrix arrays running from the late 90s
1364295 looks like emc has finally realized the potential of the clariion platform and its flexibility
1364296 this is a gap filler and tier extender all in one
1364297 we actually have an exchange 2007 project coming up and we are contemplating giving 500 mb to 2 gb mailboxes to every one of our 16 000 active users
1364298 i will need the maximum number of drives these new arrays can handle just to get that much capacity
1364299 what we have been looking at is what emc refers to as their unified storage platform using the celerra product
1364300 it would give us options to use nas or fibre channel san on the same array allowing us to use any combination of iscsi or fibre channel protocols im not sure if cx4 will integrate a lot of the feature sets that celerra brings to the table
1364301 appropriate application workloads like backup to disk and disk based archiving
1364302 we have tested and qualified spin down with our own backup technologies such as the emc disk library

1364538 his failure to do so i think shows that he just doesnt get it when it comes to some of these ethical issues
1364539 tijdens de bijeenkomst heeft icann wel meegegeven dat de aanvraag voor een eigen achtervoegsel zeker 100 000 euro zal bedragen daarnaast moeten er keiharde garanties worden gegeven dat de aanvrager technisch in staat is om die domeinnamen te beheren
1364540 in eerste instantie zullen merkenhouders de mogelijkheid hebben om hun extensie te registreren
1364541 we denken daarbij vooral aan gemeentes die enerzijds voor zichzelf domeinnamen willen registreren zoals www toerisme gent of www politie gent ook bedrijven zouden elke lokale vestiging een domeinnaam kunnen geven zoals bijvoorbeeld www antwerpen scapa
1364542 er is immers een mogelijkheid om de kostprijs van 100 000 euro terug te verdienen want wie in het bezit is van een eigen extensie mag immers domeinnamen onder die extensie verkopen voor een zelfgekozen prijs
1364543 wie een leuk achtervoegsel weet te bemachtigen zoals porno movies of web kan natuurlijk al beginnen dromen van een miljonairsbestaan
1364544 of op zijn minst toch erg voorbarig we zullen pas later dit jaar een draft request for proposal over deze materie uitwerken er ligt op dit moment dus nog geen enkele procedure vast
1364545 natuurlijk zijn bedrijven die bij ons een preregistratie zullen doen niet zeker of ze die bewuste domein verkrijgen maar dat was indertijd ook voor be namen niet het geval
1364546 zon preregistratie is bij ons trouwens volledig gratis en vrijblijvend
1364547 bovendien gaat het bij het plan van icann enkel om een versoepeling van de gewone regeling de extensie biz is bijvoorbeeld ooit k door een gewoon bedrijf aangevraagd ook dat was een domeinextensie
1364548 op de icann website lees ik zelf dat ze al in het tweede kwartaal met die versoepeling willen beginnen echt lang moeten ze er dus niet mee wachten
1364549 one of the coolest if not the coolest parts of the ava in terms of degree days
1364550 so even though they said the original livermore valley ava was a unique growing area now theyre saying theres even more of that unique growing area
1364551 and because they never wanted to go through this silly process of re amending the boundaries again they decided that the livermore valley ava line now goes up to the summit of mount diablo
1364552 we actually started processing applications dealing with avas within avas in november 2007
1364553 id allow avas within avas but maybe the states should come up with their own system
1364554 coming around the corner and seeing the checkerboard building always makes me smile
1364555 its an architectural rubiks cube fun colorful and a bit puzzling i totally love it
1364556 if portland gets a handsome modern building on that site at the expense of the checkerboard i think an important and wonderful part of the city and its architectural past will be lost
1364557 you could still build these big buildings for a fairly reasonable price
1364558 with all the supply out by the airport it would typically take about two years to absorb all of that space
1364559 thereve been a lot of great neighbors who say they want to take it on and it was our goal to institute involvement
1364560 we were hoping to find funding for the feasibility study which may still happen but just to show theres support from the community is a success
1364561 this is particularly exciting because its an opportunity to learn how to retrofit neighborhoods
1364562 if we learn lessons here we can apply it in north and northeast portland and not just the north pearl which is a new neighborhood
1364563 my mission was to say this is how you can reuse materials and incorporate as many green building standards as possible
1364564 many homes have been deconstructed and salvaged and people have done a lot of wonderful things
1364565 we discovered that it was literally falling down and we couldnt save the house
1364566 it was just a light bulb moment when we said what if we can save everything
1364567 out of this project ive learned more than 100 ways to reuse household items and materials
1364568 that translates into saving money and keeping our landfills free from useful debris ive saved thousands of dollars on this project
1364569 ill be very curious tomorrow morning to see where and how this story gets placed

1364582 i needed money to play the game every day my parents give me only 100 baht a day which is not enough i am also fed up with them fighting they are civil servants and do not make good money
1364583 i dont think excessive playing of the game is the sole cause there must be other causes too
1364584 life is like a box of chocolates you never know which one youre gonna get

1364594 we could climb every mountain swim through every sea when all the world is asleep we could set ourselves
1364595 when its difficult to find the right candidates we rely on social networking sites its extensively used to recruit people for positions of specialised skills this method is successful as we have recruited many candidates in this way
1364596 its a continuous process we pay a certain amount to one of the social sites we prefer and keep tracking skilled professionals we can reach lakhs of prospective employees
1364597 about 30 per cent of recruitments to key positions are done through social websites
1364598 hundreds are killed dozens are paid compensation but only three to four persons are convicted each year in the last 13 years only 684 cases of custodial violence have been awarded compensation by the national human rights commission
1364599 the requirement of prior permission under section 197 of the criminal procedure code and section 6 of the armed forces special powers act 1958 for prosecution of the accused law enforcement personnel promotes impunity the executive acts as the supra judicial body to decide whether the accused law enforcement personnel should be prosecuted or not by the judiciary
1364600 judiciarys role has been laudable but the courts are hampered by lack of specific legislation against torture immunities offered to the law enforcement personnel under the criminal procedure code and national security laws and the more general problem of judicial delay
1364601 illness natural death escaping from custody suicides attacks by other criminals riots due to accidents and during treatment or hospitalization
1364602 however the home minister failed to clarify as to why so many accused had committed suicide in police detention what had led them to act in this manner and how they had accessed the means for committing suicide like knives poisons and open electric cables etc or how the victims could commit suicide with strange objects like shoe laces underwear etc

1364657 the feeding the multitudes which occurs directly after jesus is informed of john the baptists death by beheading
1364658 the short answer to the question that we arrived at together was that there can be meaning in suffering but there isnt always
1364659 the idea that suffering joins us to one another its pretty much a universal experience and can either be used for good or evil
1364660 instead of uniting us it appears that suffering separates us one of the amazing things jesus shows us is how much weve got that backwards
1364661 i had suggested that jesus was heartbroken grieving at the news of his friends death and intended to get away by himself when he set out in the boat
1364662 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant

1364668 do you believe in god why youve seen no proof of it you dont have to see proof of a thing to see its results or consequences
1364669 i think the media has to take a lot of blame for all the derogatory remarks written about the economy and this country day in and day out
1364670 please just once in a while write about something pleasant and with good common sense
1364671 as usual you dont have a clue just fan flames it is not bushs bail out its your damn demagogs sic you know the jack asses imploding economy really
1364672 youre hysterical and worse out of focus try saying something new and constructive
1364673 the subprime meltdown is a perfect example of the emperor has no clothes phenomenon these were complex products yet obfuscation was considered acceptable bank chief executives should have asked more questions i suspect they saw the juicy profits and hoped underlings understood the risks investment banking culture has a cult aspect to it if you work on wall street or in the city you toe the party line despite lip service to diversity diversity of thinking is not encouraged this atmosphere of craven conformity breeds at first complacency and then mistakes
1364674 the last days of the late great state of california
1364675 i strongly support welfare programs designed to provide the permanently disabled the aged and the infirm with not only the necessities of life but also some of the comforts which can make life worth living but
1364676 a segment of our citizens who make welfare a profession
1364677 the methods of advertising work as well for political ideologies as they do for refrigerators and washing machines
1364678 so it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples and also the main crop of apples when they ripened should be reserved for the pigs alone
1364679 we dont have a levee system like we should at this time

1364697 at this time we most especially need to remind girls and women to not wear immodest low cut dresses or blouses women and girls should be careful that their dress is not revealing at all even when they bend over or kneel down

1364699 we want to lift a loud voice to change our food system
1364700 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
1364701 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden
1364702 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
1364703 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold

1364709 slow food is the opposite of fast food it is food that comes from local sustainable farms
1364710 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice
1364711 the current industrial model will soon fail for its heavy dependency on homogeneity and petroleum as such slow food is about survival
1364712 on a long 200 person table for a meal curated by outstanding in the field
1364713 26 dynamic presentations on topics ranging from the viability of rare breeds to the nuts and bolts of engaging our isolated urban and rural communities in the sustainable food movement

1364715 the clash of ideas critical thinking from incisive minds and inspiring dialog
1364716 more people are thinking about what they eat these days
1364717 im proud to be a small part of this movement with a vision for a better food system it can help activate people to work to change food policies
1364718 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1364719 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1364720 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1364721 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1364722 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1364723 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1364724 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
1364725 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food
1364726 i traded them for tomatoes of which i have many
1364727 we need to do more foraging and gleaning lots of food is wasted on the ground which is very edible
1364728 have a long history yet are mostly ignored by the culinary mainstream
1364729 weve been writing a declaration and petition calling for a new national food policy
1364730 when kids grow and cook their own food they all want to eat it
1364731 they want an interactive education they are happy to be in the garden kids are not just hungry for food they are hungry for people to take care of them and for nature
1364732 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states

1364734 sees that banks are safe places for people to keep their money
1364735 were about to board love ill call you when we land
1364736 i may have talked about a thing i do in life thats very hard for me but i went and did it too
1364737 im pretty honest so i will tell you that touring is very hard for me
1364738 but i am in amsterdam right now and i drove from krakow last night i am where im supposed to be
1364739 every night i go out on stage and have this incredible emotional connection between me the band and the audience then just like that its over i go backstage back to the bus back to my hotel room and sit there all by myself that deep connection is yanked away in an instant its like breaking up with your girlfriend over and over again every night
1364740 you have to go through the disintegration of saturday night to get to sunday morning
1364741 and they have to work from top to bottom people will put their ipods on shuffle and enjoy it and we play shows where the songs are in a different order and that works great too but for the album itself the musical piece that were trying to create like a symphony it goes through movements
1364742 theres always going to be at least two or three years between counting crows records because we tour for two years after each one
1364743 we only come to your town once twice three times but the truth is we are continuously shuttling around the world
1364744 we had this idea that we could tour while we were making hard candy two weeks in the studio a month on the road a week in the studio three weeks on the road
1364745 then we went and toured hard candy toured the greatest hits album toured shrek 2
1364746 essentially it was five and a half years of touring at the end of that i was just shot i was dead i didnt want anything to do with new music for a while so i just fell off the face of the earth i knew i needed to get my health together
1364747 what i knew was if you write a song youre gonna want to record it
1364748 if you record it youre now making an album if you make an album youre gonna want to put it out and now youre back on the road again
1364749 you guys are all happier than you think you are
1364750 we continue to learn more about how ultraviolet light from the sun affects our skin historically weve known that ultraviolet b rays uvb contribute to skin cancer more recently weve gained a better understanding that the ultraviolet a rays uva also cause skin cancer and are the main contributor to wrinkling and aging changes the term broad spectrum coverage means a preparation protects across the spectrum against both uva and uvb rays sunscreen makers are challenged to formulate sunscreens that give the best coverage and at the same time are aesthetically pleasing so people will use them consistently
1364751 physical blockers include preparations with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide these reflect and block the suns rays we used to associate these with lifeguard white but newer preparations are micronized and rub in colorless they are still the best for children people with sensitive skin and those with skin allergies because they dont contain a lot of preservatives physical blockers protect against both uvb and uva
1364752 as far as spf goes you cant go too high spf 15 may be adequate but the problem is that most people dont put enough on or cover all areas thoroughly so we recommend an spf of at least 30 if youve had a history of skin cancer or other sun exposure problems go with an spf of 45 or higher
1364753 the average white tee shirt has an spf of 4 8 most people dont know that a better idea is for sun exposure protection with lightweight uv clothing its available in bathing suits shirts pants hats and for babies through adults using that for small children allows parents to apply sunscreen only to exposed areas these outfits are available on line for reasonable prices and make great baby gifts
1364754 there is one product available called rit sunguard laundry treatment it lasts for 25 washes

1364780 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

1364858 we are excited to get this important work started to help us better understand the watershed the combination of north state resources understanding and expertise in northern california with the knowledge of some of californias leading scientists from the university of california will result in the development of valuable data that will benefit the mccloud community for years to come

1364861 nor does the deir adequately examine the impacts of the project on air quality water quality of the mccloud river and its tributaries biological resources or solid waste
1364862 the environmental review for the previously proposed project had serious deficiencies
1364863 the suggested changes would require significant revision of the contract between nestle and the mccloud community services district a new formal project proposal and circulation of a new draft environmental impact report

1364865 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1364866 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1364867 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1364880 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1364881 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law

1364883 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1364884 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1364885 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1364886 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1364887 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

1364904 in several states including the traditional battlegrounds of nevada and iowa democrats have surprised their own party officials with significant gains in registration
1364905 in six states including iowa new hampshire and pennsylvania the democratic piece of the registration pie grew more than three percentage points while the republican share declined in only three states kentucky louisiana and oklahoma did republican registration rise while democratic registration fell but the republican increase was less than a percentage point in kentucky and oklahoma louisiana was the only state to register a gain of more than one percentage point for republicans as democratic numbers declined
1364906 swings in party registration are not uncommon from one year to the next or even over two years registration moreover often has no impact on how people actually vote and people sometimes switch registration to vote in a primary then flip again come election day but for a shift away from one party to sustain itself the current registration trend is now in its fourth year is remarkable researchers who study voting patterns say and though comparable data are not available for the 21 states where voters do not register by party there is evidence that an increasing number of voters in those states are also moving away from the republican party based on the results of recent state and congressional elections the researchers said

1364927 innovation brokers help to mobilise innovations identify opportunities that the current system undervalues and they broker relationships between disparate parts of the system in particular they broker relationships between innovation creators innovation seekers such as commissioner of services investors and policy makers
1364928 monopolistic sectors tend not to be very innovative sectors with lots of very small players tend to be good at incremental innovation sectors with many small players and a few large players tend to be better at more radical innovation
1364929 innovation rich sectors tend to be highly networked with a high number of random connections between individuals and organisations and a high level of social cultural and professional diversity within these social networks this explains the important role that brokers play in estaboishing and maintaining such networks and relationships building relationships between innovators in different organisations and creating rules that make it safe to share be open about problems and potential solutions is important

1364936 this delivery while not the first for the messenger mission represents a significant milestone
1364937 we had delivered data from messenger to the pds before but not mercury data
1364938 this delivery was particularly significant the first messenger flyby of mercury was mankinds return to this planet after an absence of over three decades in this one flyby we imaged previously unseen areas of mercurys surface greatly improved the resolution in areas already covered and made observations of a kind that had never been made before
1364939 the science results from these instruments have already shed light on questions about mercury that have lingered for more than three decades
1364940 the availability of these data via pds will allow scientists around the world to study the data and begin making even more connections and discoveries
1364941 an essential element of the implementation of nasa missions is the dissemination of collected data to the science community at large
1364942 its critical to maintain a planetary data archive that will withstand the test of time so that future generations of scientists can access understand and use pre existing planetary data
1364943 the pds validation process needs to be comprehensive and unforgiving to ensure that only high quality well documented data are released for use by the science community
1364944 the data archives do not need to be perfect but they do need to be documented well enough that future users unfamiliar with how the data were acquired can understand the data and apply them to new problems
1364945 the tool now includes actual unprocessed images from the narrow angle and wide angle cameras taken during the january flyby
1364946 viewers will see the same images that told the team that the cameras were not only on target but were revealing mercury as it had never been seen before
1364947 its a unique opportunity to project high resolution nasa data for educational purposes
1364948 many members of the messenger team devoted long hours and weekends to ensure that the project met the goal of releasing all of our mercury data six months after the flyby we are delighted to share these historic data with the scientific community and the public and we hope that their availability will foster interest everywhere in the mysteries of the suns closest planetary neighbor

1364995 vice president dick cheney will not make an appearance at the republican convention in minneapolis st paul next month according to sources in his office cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention the mccain campaign has not gone out of its way to reach out to cheney though a segment of conservative republicans had been pressing the campaign to include cheney in the convention agenda
1364996 what is it about john mccain that makes you want to serve him
1364997 is mccain running a limping message free presidential campaign on a couple of issues most notably iraq that analysis is incorrect but on too may fronts its an accurate assessment as i argued in the post in march mccain cannot win in november unless he has his conservative base energetically working for his election
1364998 mr mccain seems intent on reassuring skeptics that hes no george w bush if he loses in november hell prove it
1364999 how does his wife stand mccain disrespecting her the way that he does
1365000 if he feels the government has the right to grab a legitimate companys profits then what else does he think the government has the power to do
1365001 god bless john mccain he is going to make a fine president

1365004 obama opened his 18th campaign office in indiana on monday and expects to open 25 to 30 mccain has yet to open an office here and obama is running his third campaign commercial here since the primary mccain has not bought indiana tv time
1365005 so here is a radical suggestion rather than sparring on the republican playing field to determine the rougher and tougher leader democrats should introduce more clearly substantive differences how about this for a message ending the war in iraq now making an apollo like investment in alternative energy and starting a revolution in health care to cover every american i suggest making clear that this election is not about who is strong or weak but about who is right or wrong maybe the key will be to emphasize that there will be real policy differences between a democrat and a republican in the white house next year and that those differences will as they did in the past eight years make all of the difference in the world to the country and the lives of its people
1365006 if you grew up in the 1950s you were inclined to regard your identity as something you were born with if you grew up in the 1970s you were more likely to regard your identity as something you created if obama is fully a member of any club and perhaps he isnt it is the club of smart post boomer meritocrats we now have a cohort of rising leaders obamas age and younger who climbed quickly through elite schools and now ascend from job to job they are conscientious and idealistic while also being coldly clever and self aware its not clear what the rest of america makes of them
1365007 bill clinton refuses to say barack obama is ready for white house
1365008 i said i thought it was a good thing because winning shouldnt be easy winning the presidency should not be easy this had to be earned
1365009 cynicism is a natural response to what people have seen over the past 20 30 years
1365010 theres no reason why they should buy into a lot of flowery language and nice speeches without lifting the hood and kicking the tires to see if this thing is for real and so we worked harder and we worked smarter and we were able to emerge after an incredibly hard fought battle as the presumptive nominee and were now in the process of bringing the party together so we come out of the convention entirely unified and ready to take on the last leg of this journey
1365011 and hes got i think an image certainly among the press and in the country that is formidable
1365012 but we cant assume that just because weve endured eight years of some of the worst arrogance in our history and that because john mccain has embraced some of those policies that we will automatically win
1365013 the other thing is that john mccain has showed a willingness to shift on almost every issue
1365014 john mccain said america wanted a different kind of campaign wanted a campaign of big ideas not insults wanted a campaign that took us to a different place here we are with a campaign as weve seen in the last weeks that has taken the lowest road possible according to every major judgment
1365015 so here is a radical suggestion rather than sparring on the republican playing field to determine the rougher and tougher leader democrats should introduce more clearly substantive differences
1365016 bill clinton refuses to say barack obama is ready for white house
1365017 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1365018 we should be as careful getting out as we were getting in

1365025 the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues
1365026 the proposal along with obamas comments last week that he would consider expanding offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive energy bill illustrated how both candidates are trying to find quick fixes to 4 a gallon gas and other rising energy costs mccain had also opposed additional offshore drilling until reversing his position in june and he has called for a suspension of the federal gas tax
1365027 but their proposals reflect a problem both candidates face there are few ways to dramatically reduce gas prices even as voters demand solutions
1365028 at the heart of mr obamas proposals is a focus on fostering alternative energy development by investing 150 billion in emerging technologies and renewable fuels seeking to put a million fuel efficient hybrid plug in automobiles on the road he said that he would offer a 7 000 tax credit to buyers the overall cost of which he did not specify in addition mr obama said his goal was to have 10 percent of the countrys energy needs met by renewable resources by the end of his first term more than double the current figure
1365029 john mccain received prolonged applause from the oil executives who gathered june 17 in houston to hear the republican presidential candidates speech on energy policy now it appears that mccain received something else lots of campaign contributions
1365030 john mccains contributions from energy industry interests happened to spike right around his houston speech and a fundraising tour of texas is it a coincidence the result of aggressive texas outreach or is it a show of gratitude let us know what you think
1365031 i think taking money away from profitable companies and giving it away to people that dont deserve it is a great economic policy what could go wrong with that
1365032 hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1365033 hes offering a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer and hes offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling thats what senator mccain is offering
1365034 pelosis gambit rests on one big assumption that democrats will own washington after the election and will be able to craft a sweeping energy policy that is heavy on conservation and fuel alternatives while allowing for some new oil drilling democrats see no need to make major concessions on energy policy with a party poised to lose seats in both chambers in just three months even if recess averse republicans continue to pound away on the issue
1365035 it was almost as if mccain the presumptive republican presidential nominee was a celebrity a dirty word in his lexicon since his campaign last week ran ads mocking rival barack obama for his celebrity status comparing him to britney spears
1365036 mccain joked that he had encouraged his wife to enter the annual sturgis beauty contest one in which nudity is not uncommon the engines roared again i told her with a little luck she could be the only lady to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip he said with a broad grin
1365037 i suggest making clear that this election is not about who is strong or weak but about who is right or wrong maybe the key will be to emphasize that there will be real policy differences between a democrat and a republican in the white house next year and that those differences will as they did in the past eight years make all of the difference in the world to the country and the lives of its people
1365038 in order to bolster the connection between al qaeda and iraq the white house ordered the cia to write a fake letter from the iraqi intelligence chief habbush claiming that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta trained in iraq prior to september 11th
1365039 you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
1365040 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1365041 with obama campaigning with evan bayh tomorrow fueling tons of veep speculation what will the liberal blogosphere think about bayh as a possible running mate
1365042 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify
1365043 will obama no longer have to answer for some of the hip hop references hes made after mccain yesterday visited the biker rally festival in sturgis sd which also featured scantily clad women and concerts by kid rock and kiss
1365044 it was almost as if mccain the presumptive republican presidential nominee was a celebrity a dirty word in his lexicon since his campaign last week ran ads mocking rival barack obama for his celebrity status comparing him to britney spears
1365045 mccain joked that he had encouraged his wife to enter the annual sturgis beauty contest one in which nudity is not uncommon the engines roared again i told her with a little luck she could be the only lady to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip he said with a broad grin

1365071 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1365072 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1365144 i would not have done so because we thought the most appropriate venue for this would be in the community
1365145 i said the government would be making an apology but indicated it to media afterwards that decision hasnt been made
1365146 when we heard it was not going to be held in parliament we said if you are not going to apologize in the house of commons do not apologize over here
1365147 they said no this is where we have decided to apologize we said that was unacceptable and walked out of the meeting

1365249 the kuwaiti premier said cambodia has great potential for agriculture due to good weather conditions and industrious people
1365250 kuwait has money and can help cambodia become a major agricultural power
1365251 kuwait thinks cambodia needs a little capital and has great agricultural potential with sufficient investment proper irrigation systems with good rice seed and scientific growing methods we can increase our current rice output four to five times production costs in cambodia are not high and export prices are cheap
1365252 research is first being done to find the correct site for production and export to kuwait as was done with qatar in the past we do not allow foreign nationals to buy or rent land but we can do as is being done with a number of farmers growing corn and tobacco we supply the seed and set the purchase price contractually if the price is high in future we will buy the crop from the farmer at the reigning price if the price drops we will buy the crop at the minimum price set in the contract we will also allow farmers to borrow capital without paying interest
1365253 cambodia is an important rice exporter because it has favorable natural conditions particularly a lot of farmland which has not yet been used
1365254 agricultural land which is now being used has not reached its fullest production potential as with other countries we can increase rice output

1365366 the stolen is a multi layered thriller that has no faults the only problem with a henry parker novel is that you simply cannot put one down once you open the cover and you are guaranteed a fabulous and exciting roller coaster reading experience

1365386 i have to say wow i thought it was a great book too bad i have to wait until march oh well if the other three are any indication the wait will be well worth it
1365387 the stolen was great another great example of why youre my favorite author
1365388 i finished the book last night and thought it was great i think the thing i like best about your books is that its never a formulaic reading
1365389 if you lose a whole board you lose 1 24th of your performance
1365390 its a running joke every time we update symmetrix we get the question about whats going to happen to clariion and every time we update clariion we ask whats going to happen to symmetrix we keep making clariion bigger and symmetrix smaller
1365391 yes were merging our primary storage products the same way were

1365397 i got my piercing and tattoos just because i could and thats why i posed for nn too
1365398 im sure ive done more guys than most girls my age but i wont do just anybody im picky and real careful
1365399 weve just received a sound tip that microsoft is working on its very own phone to be branded under the zune moniker our tipsters inform us that microsoft execs are in meetings today hammering out details of the device and developing strategies and timescales for its release
1365400 mister king as it were is appealing he wants his conviction repealing some boys did accuse him of childhood abuse when they finally got round to squealing so we come to the crux of our trial mister king some young boys did defile drag his name through the mud im with sovereign mlud this perverts exceedingly vile
1365401 the stories were just fabrications though my client admits penetrations have you not realised its decriminalized theres no basis to these allegations to call mister king here a nonce is an over emotive response should we all be so riled by the new oscar wilde or should we just try nonchalance
1365402 it would tax the worlds canniest sleuth did king drink from the fountain of youth although he got blamed he claims he was framed and im buggered if i know the truth
1365403 je lai vue fuyez tant quil vous est encore possible de le faire
1365404 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1365405 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1365406 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1365407 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1365408 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1365409 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1365410 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it
1365411 it is sad to say that some of my muslim brothers failed to understand or follow islamic values
1365412 muslims violating koran teachings are not worthy to be called muslims
1365413 in our society we cannot deny the fact that most of the crimes committed are done by people under the influence of either drugs or liquor many families encounter financial difficulties because of gambling
1365414 the pressure on telecommunications providers to improve customer service has never been greater
1365415 as their offerings are increasingly commoditized the one remaining differentiator is customer service and these companies call centers are often plagued with a mass of aging complicated and inflexible information systems a unified service desktop solution is a powerful weapon for dramatically and rapidly improving customer service without requiring a rewrite or replacement of existing systems its not surprising that jacada appears to be gaining significant traction in this market
1365416 weve seen time and time again the devastating effects that a complex desktop with multiple non integrated applications can have on customer service
1365417 its even more accentuated in a highly volatile and commoditized market like telecommunications an industry where a clear link between the quality of customer experience and companies financial performance has been so visibly established customers who call a telecommunications providers contact center want their issue handled quickly and efficiently they dont want to be placed on hold or have to call multiple times to resolve the same issue jacada is excited to build yet another partnership with a major communications provider adding to our recent string of similar announcements within the global telecommunications community

1365468 we had to learn and do that process through the first set up of the court which wasted quite a long time
1365469 thai troops indicated that they would withdraw only when the border conflict in preah vihear will be resolved
1365470 thailand wants to profit from preah vihear to resolve the border problems at the same time
1365471 the joint border committee in charge of thailand and cambodia must be allowed to do its work
1365472 60 thai soldiers took position 70 meters in front of the temple they are clearly on our national territory
1365473 it is true that the prasat what thai people call khmer style temples is located just about 100 meters from the border in the thai soil the fine arts department discovered and registered it as one of our thai ancient items in 1935 or about 73 years ago
1365474 why are you so mean to your very own people and yet so tenuous and pregnable and willing to succumb to foreign pressure
1365475 what kind of leadership are planning to teach to your followers children grandchildren and other generations when youre unable to utilize the same power you have used against your own people
1365476 the constiutional councils declared that its decision was fair bu tin a democratic society each fairness is supported by the other but right now this decision is not supported by the opposition party so the fairness is in the mystery
1365477 we raised 90 000 in three minutes and after years of scraping together the first 30 000 this was incredible it was overwhelming i almost fell over
1365478 i had the feeling they hadnt ever gotten anybody to come there that we were the first
1365479 that was pretty effective in raising awareness but not effective in raising big bucks
1365480 and it was very time consuming at that point i thought the project was going to cost 25 000
1365481 he saw it and said i dont think you realize how big this is tobias
1365482 i said all right lets do it that was three and a half years ago
1365483 which we started to do but there was a big communication barrier and i wanted to be actively involved to learn and i couldnt do this with the cambodians
1365484 weve been buying large jugs of benzyl benzoate and going from village to village for scabies cleaning ceremonies
1365485 everything is tied in you cant just look at one thing as the sole solution to the communitys problems with the reservoir we were trying to get to one of the most basic issues the local economy if they dont have water to grow rice they wont have rice to sell if they dont have enough rice to sell they cant afford to send their children to a doctor its the same with water if they dont have clean water and they are too sick to work they cant plant rice

1365487 however i agree that it is a case of systematic doping this would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban
1365488 i shouldnt really say very much as i am no longer a part of the iaaf but this is a very bad story

1365493 adem s la finca cuenta con un jard n imponente con rboles centenarios que tendr an que ser eliminados de la parcela donde se pretende construir
1365494 pretende dividir la finca en dos partes una de 4
1365495 la otra parcela de 3 279 metros cuadrados permanecer a en poder de las monjas y el ayuntamiento est tramitando un cambio de uso para pasar de equipamiento escolar a residencia comunitaria adem s la congregaci n recibir a un mill n de euros
1365496 lo que significa que la finca ni puede ser dividida ni se puede eliminar el frondoso arbolado con el cuenta ni se pueden cambiar las alineaciones

1365498 that begins with recognizing that the single most important factor in determining a childs achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from its not who their parents are or how much money they have its who their teacher is

1365504 matt has been an asset to the show but we have both agreed that matthew king will leave emmerdale in an explosive storyline at the end of the year
1365505 it is difficult people have to be realistic football clubs do not make money at this level
1365506 our objective is just to get stable to break even would be good were on a sound financial footing and weve been debt free for a little while
1365507 he hasnt asked for much the objective was always to try and improve in individual areas of the pitch
1365508 i think weve selectively done that and improved place after place
1365509 its going to be a little bit of a struggle to get to the end but its been a fantastic effort
1365510 if victorious high school football teams raped the cheerleaders carried off the homecoming queen to sell her into slavery and slaughtered the opposing team and left their bloody corpses for the crows on the fifty yard line
1365511 the most logical assumption was that there would be two races of cuckoo each specializing on a different host and making a begging call that matches its host
1365512 we were amazed to find that the chicks could modify their calls
1365513 remarkably they make the same begging call as the chicks of whichever host rears them even though they never actually hear the host chicks
1365514 chicks reared by a host other than a fairy wren might find that they arent getting fed properly because they arent making the right call
1365515 that could prompt them to apply a simple rule that says switch to an alternative begging call if im going hungry
1365516 cuckoos survive by fooling other birds into rearing their chicks so they are grand masters of deception
1365517 do you ever start thinking about something and when you go to talk you say something you dont mean
1365518 yeah i was at the airport buying plane tickets and the chick behind the counter had these huge tits and instead of asking her for two tickets to pittsburgh i asked for two tickets to titsburgh the first guy says
1365519 aye this is a nice bar but where i come from theres a better one at macdougals you buy a drink you buy another drink and macdougal himself will buy your third drink
1365520 that sounds like a nice bar but where i come from theres a better one called quinns at quinns you buy a drink quinn buys you a drink you buy another drink quinn buys you another drink
1365521 you think thats good where i come from theres this place called murphys at murphys they buy you your first drink they buy you your second drink they buy you your third drink and then they take you in the back and get you laid
1365522 i cant discuss the case but its bad when people say opinions as if they are stating facts especially when its people who are trusted by the society that whatever they say is true
1365523 it was said eight years ago that zuma must get his day in court now that has been changed they say im the one who asked to be taken to court
1365524 the media is writing non stop that zuma is just delaying this case how can i be accused of delaying tactics
1365525 even there at the constitutional court one of the ten judges agreed with the durban one that the search was unlawful
1365526 now i dont know where the issue of delaying the case comes from because im following procedure i have a problem with that statement because im exercising my constitutional rights but im accused of delaying tactics
1365527 please i must not be intimidated when im exercising my rights if im not guilty then i have to protect myself
1365528 why would one judge before the court does it is a pity sometimes that i dont get the chance to respond to everything thats being said about me
1365529 thank you for your support you are the people who are protecting our democracy i know now that no matter what happens you will protect your country
1365530 i love you all and i will always listen to what you say when you ask me to do something i wont argue ill do exactly that
1365531 our president zuma is the target of a political conspiracy led by the state president mbeki on many occasions our president mbeki failed to intervene he fired him zuma as deputy president he found him guilty before the court could do so
1365532 constitutional court judge president pius langa and his friends will never have zuma if you want to touch him you must touch us first
1365533 on the last day of this nonsense we will take zuma to the union buildings
1365534 the youth of this country know what they must do and they will do it if jacob zuma faces jail
1365535 i love writing blogs because i love passing on information that ive researched myself
1365536 grumble all you want this is the way its going to be
1365537 you will test your safe word once within the first thirty minutes at any point that you wish to stop or renegotiate the terms your safe word will bring all activity to a halt any other screams of pleasure or pain will be considered rejected or punished as mayce and i see fit the only control you have is the use of this one word now what is your safe word

1365593 last year good results were achieved in the development of service delivery improvements plans thanks to pressure and support from the public service department
1365594 the quality of the plans is not in all instances satisfactory in particular there is a need to implement the plans at the level of service delivery points police stations schools hospitals etc rather than in the head offices only
1365595 these findings point to the need for sustained hands on support to departments coupled with the systematic enforcement of the regulations to ensure that the basic minimum requirements of sound administration are met
1365596 hands on support is being provided to departments in hr planning a public service wide programme aimed at strengthening hr management capacity in the public service is underway

1365637 ya hemos conocido que el mes de julio ha sido un mes negro para el empleo y cuando se destruye empleo se recorta el derecho al trabajo de todos los espa oles
1365638 pero no es s lo que se cercene un derecho fundamental es que el gobierno est recortando derechos sociales concretos

1365655 for over two years amazon web services has provided infrastructure services that help companies of all sizes from small startups to larger enterprises realize the cost time and scaling efficiencies of cloud computing we believe that cloud computing will continue to grow into a large industry with companies providing a range of different services
1365656 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
1365657 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts
1365658 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
1365659 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand

1365670 in 50 years the lifeblood of movement diversity and interaction that keeps a large city like fort worth together will have dwindled to a trickle the city will have collapsed under the weight of its own sprawl and its addiction to oil and the automobile
1365671 will pay a heavy price for its failure to develop public transportation and for policies that have allowed encouraged actually the sprawling development of the metroplex
1365672 will necessitate new ways of thinking about time locality personal style and the rest
1365673 riding a bicycle for instance changes more than your transport it changes your sense of pace your understanding of the city your interactions with others and your balance between journey and destination

1365678 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1365679 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1365680 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1365681 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1365682 when you play a physical team like timpview it shows you how much harder you need to work to be at that level

1365686 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1365687 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1365688 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1365689 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1365690 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

1365709 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
1365710 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
1365711 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
1365712 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
1365713 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant

1365722 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs
1365723 in the past year alone the two experiments have produced 77 ph d s and 100 publications that advance the state of our knowledge across the span of particle physics at the energy frontier
1365724 the discovery of the higgs boson would answer one of the big questions in physics today
1365725 we have not heard the last from the tevatron experiments
1365726 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
1365727 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
1365728 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
1365729 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1365730 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1365731 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1365732 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1365733 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1365734 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1365735 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1365736 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1365737 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid

1365926 the raritan is a major river in central jersey and we are eager to begin work on areas of the river and marshland that have been contaminated by past activities at these two superfund sites
1365927 we have already achieved a great deal at these two sites and beginning this last phase of the cleanup will not only be a positive for the community of sayreville but also for central jersey
1365928 as a matter of both law and public policy i strongly recommend that alternative sites be considered as soon as possible
1365929 this one seems objectionable because of its potential impact on the community and quality of life as well as legally problematic on environmental grounds
1365930 while i strongly support your objective providing the most effective modern training facility for our dedicated and able armed forces i believe the present site selection process is legally problematic even objectionable
1365931 the governors announcement today that our national guard is reducing the projects scope means that the process can and should begin anew without any pre selection of the current site the smaller scope makes selection of another site more feasible the law makes it mandatory
1365932 information provided my staff indicates that the site contains a significant amount of wetlands and other potentially significant environmental resources as well as a possibly historic 18th century farmhouse in this situation a complete comprehensive environmental impact statement is mandatory
1365933 more importantly the corps cannot permissibly at this point designate the boardman road site as the preferred site such selection is illegally premature and unauthorized as the corps
1365934 i am also disturbed that corps officials have failed to publicly acknowledge that they will follow the mandatory requirements of the clean water act 33 usc 1351 et seq
1365935 these legal flaws and defects would seem to raise legally actionable objections

1365979 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1365980 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once
1365981 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and and took her

1366044 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world

1366051 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1366052 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1366053 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1366054 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1366055 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1366056 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1366057 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1366058 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1366059 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1366060 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1366061 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1366206 the fact of the matter is what the hoffman decision tells us is that those days are over you cant do that anymore
1366207 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1366208 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is
1366209 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1366210 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1366211 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and
1366212 why dont you pick up the brush and create i am giving you everything and you are doing nothing
1366213 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with this virus he has had its a bad virus he has not been training

1366223 he came up to my office with some of his people
1366224 he came to talk to me about the business how i did business he was here for quite a while ill do that from time to time talk to people even if theyre my competitors it was the strangest conversation id ever had he thanked me for my time and then said good bye
1366225 ill talk to competitors there always could be something in it for me i believe that on a level playing field even if you know what im doing i can still beat you even if you know my play im not afraid of any opponent
1366226 regrettably i am afraid the time has come for me to retire and discontinue the column
1366227 this un planned retirement was caused by the diagnosis of a brain tumor with a dire prognosis

1366236 mit dem streik der autoren hat sich die ganze angelegenheit sehr verz gert da unser autor roger avery noch vor fertigstellung des wolfenstein stoffes eine verpflichtung zu erf llen hatte ich stehe momentan in kontakt mit ihm und er arbeitet ab sofort an dem drehbuch
1366237 non so assolutamente nulla di questa storia non mi stato comunicato niente non vero niente
1366238 andrea mi ha risposto molto gentilmente e non pensava a me quando diceva certe cose ora parliamo di scherma
1366239 ho sentito andrea baldini ndr anzi gli ho mandato un sms ha detto il fiorettista appena sbarcato nella capitale cinese e lui mi ha risposto molto carinamente ieri della vicenda non ho voluto parlare perch non c nulla di pi da dire
1366240 sono solo voci inventate ha detto cassar di certo non venivano da andrea ora per spero si faccia spazio alle gare lho sentito capisco il suo rammarico ma lui non ha mai pensato a me quando diceva certe cose gli sono state messe in bocca per riempire le pagine dei giornali
1366241 e una baruffa estiva le sue parole vanno prese per quelle che sono ha fatto vedere subito personalit chiarezza e il suo stile ecco cosa pensa dei suoi colleghi lo posso capire dopotutto venuto in italia al posto di mancini nella squadra che ha vinto gli ultimi 2 scudetti a lui hanno chiesto di vincere tutto e subito con il bel gioco io dallalto dei miei 70 anni in realt il tecnico della juve ha 56 anni ndr ho una certa saggezza e sar il primo a complimentarmi con lui
1366242 queste partite continua lallenatore della juventus non si possono definire amichevoli visto il fascino che hanno per noi si tratter sicuramente di un altro bel banco di prova fino ad ora le cose stanno andando bene le sensazioni sono positive siamo a un buon punto e i ragazzi stanno digerendo bene il lavoro svolto
1366243 non lannuncio in anticipo ma sicuramente scenderanno in campo quelli che hanno giocato meno e hanno pi bisogno di minutaggio come i nazionali italiani e poulsen la mia idea di dare ritmo alla gara non ho in mente tante sostituzioni
1366244 indignato e profondamente colpito da striscioni denigratori esposti nel secondo anello della curva nord occupata dagli ultr interisti nei confronti dei napoletani
1366245 recitavano espressioni come napoli fogna ditalia ciao coleros partenopei tubercolos infam cui si aggiungevano canti e cori razzisti
1366246 il gesto della tedesca duplitzer che non sar alla cerimonia sia di stimolo agli atleti
1366247 il gesto dellatleta tedesca imke duplitzer che ha annunciato di non prendere parte alla cerimonia inaugurale dei giochi per protesta contro il mancato rispetto dei diritti umani in cina sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani
1366248 si tratta aggiunge di un gesto simbolico che dovrebbe invitare tutti a riflettere su quei principi fondamentali pace libert e democrazia che non possono essere messi in secondo piano
1366249 ognuno ha spiegato la meloni ha una responsabilit e tutti quelli che rappresentano litalia compresi gli atleti sono l in rappresentanza di una democrazia che si basa su dei valori fondanti il presupposto di questi giochi era proprio quello di cercare di chiedere con maggiore forza alla cina passi avanti in materia di diritti umani e civili
1366250 non si mosso nulla e anzi il problema sembra del tutto dimenticato
1366251 non solo gli atleti ma anche i tifosi potrebbero esprimere la loro opinione ad esempio facendo delle dichiarazioni o ricordando nelle interviste lo spirito olimpico poi ciascuno libero di scegliere la forma che ritiene pi opportuna compresa quella di gesti pi forti magari anche quello estremo di disertare la cerimonia di inaugurazione dei giochi
1366252 boicottare no basta un gesto chiedo agli atleti azzurri e a tutti gli italiani che andranno in cina ancora di pi ai tifosi di fare un qualunque gesto e di dire la loro non c nessuno scontro in atto nel governo semplicemente abbiamo ricordato che in quanto italiani siamo portatori di un sistema di valori che riguarda soprattutto la difesa dei diritti umani e civili
1366253 considero le olimpiadi una festa di fratellanza tra i popoli e lesperienza dimostra che ogni qualvolta si sia dato corso al boicottaggio dei giochi olimpici non si raggiunto lobiettivo che ci si prefiggeva non credo che i nostri atleti abbiamo necessit di inviti particolari perch sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano e credo che non mancher loro le modalit che riterranno pi opportune per esprimere piena adesione alla necessit di un rispetto autentico dei diritti delle persone
1366254 sono andati fin l evidentemente vogliono sfilare mi sembra un po ipocrita che uno vada l per poi manifestare dissenso
1366255 rispetto ogni opinione ma gli atleti sfileranno regolarmente non c niente di pi autonomo e libero dello sport quindi non mi stupisco che ci siano posizioni diverse anche allinterno dellesecutivo gli atleti comunque evitino gesti da squalifica
1366256 si chiede agli atleti un gesto politico che semmai avrebbe dovuto fare il governo il governo poteva scegliere di non mandare una delegazione istituzionale allapertura dei giochi ma siccome nella maggioranza ci sono posizioni diverse e non sono daccordo su nulla chiedono ipocritamente agli atleti di prendere una posizione un inaccettabile scaricabarile la cerimonia inaugurale delle olimpiadi il simbolo della fratellanza il simbolo della tregua sportiva una sciocchezza chiedere ai nostri atleti di non partecipare a questo momento
1366257 non spetta al governo dire agli atleti cosa fare non penso che la via da seguire sia quella di negare la cerimonia dapertura che una festa diverso se nel corso delle olimpiadi venisse fuori limpegno civile da parte degli atleti
1366258 deploriamo ogni invito rivolto agli atleti affinch non prendano parte allinaugurazione dei giochi olimpici
1366259 certi politici anche se sono vicini alle mie idee sono incompetenti non capiscono certe cose al di fuori del loro mondo non vedo perch disertare la cerimonia di apertura allora tanto valeva boicottare i giochi e poi alla ministro meloni chiedo ma lei diserterebbe loccasione della vita
1366260 disertare la cerimonia di apertura non mi sembra un gesto valido per un atleta la cosa pi bella unesperienza da trasmettere a mio figlio un sogno che diventa realt sarebbe come tradire la moglie o mancare alla propria fede per molti poi la cerimonia dapertura pi di una medaglia
1366261 mi offendo quando un politico parla di sport perch certi gesti dimostrativi non li fanno loro o non li chiedono ad altri perch sempre a noi sportivi
1366262 il bello dello sport ha aggiunto anastasi che unisce i popoli e lolimpiade il sogno di tutti gli sportivi non capisco perch in un momento in cui attraverso lo sport tutte le genti si riavvicinano esce fuori la polemica sul tibet e quella sui diritti umani al villaggio olimpico alla mensa ho visto tutti gli atleti che cercavano di salutare nadal o federer o altre stelle dello sport questo il bello dellolimpiade
1366263 from the outset of the pay talks sinn f in was clear that the wage demands of low paid workers must be met cost of living expenses are continuing to rise and the stark reality for the low paid is that they cannot absorb increases in fuel food and mortgage costs
1366264 we were clear that in these pay talks there needed to be a clear differentiation between high and low paid during a time of economic instability it does not make sense to target the lower paid when seeking to achieve wage restraint
1366265 during the current round of pay talks employers and business bodies have sought to scapegoat low paid workers
1366266 it is also important for employers and government to recognise that there are alternative ways to address the pressures on smes
1366267 it is one year on since aer lingus withdrew its heathrow route from shannon and the effects are being sharply felt with a 16 decrease in passengers to london since the move in addition the overall passenger traffic through the airport has dropped by 9 in the first six months of this year
1366268 shannon airport is now in the precarious situation of relying on ryanair for 60 of its passengers
1366269 last years debate surrounding the withdrawal of aer lingus from shannon importantly centred on connectivity for the west and urgent need for balanced regional development throughout the state
1366270 in an effort to constructively progress this debate in the oireachtas to a point of action i secured the agreement of the oireachtas committee on community rural and gaeltacht affairs to complete a report on what is required to develop the counties along the west coast of ireland in economic and social terms
1366271 the arkinson family stands fully vindicated today in their efforts over many years to expose the complete failure of the ruc to conduct anything resembling a proper investigation into arlenes death
1366272 despite the fact that robert howards initial statement to the missing persons inquiry included a number of glaring inconsistencies despite the fact that he was on bail for serious sex offences despite the fact that had been convicted of a number of sex offences and despite the fact that grounds for his arrest on suspicion of abduction murder were available within 48 hours it is disturbing in the extreme that he was not arrested until a full 46 days after arlene was reported missing

1366304 weve trained our people in case management and become more attuned in helping kids develop job readiness skills
1366305 in the morning you have to be gone everything has to be gone
1366306 any kind of shelter is just meant to be temporary it cant deal with these larger problems
1366307 there is a huge child welfare system that is supposed to be looking out for the welfare of children
1366308 it will be lost revenue to the counties that you can bet will be made up somewhere by an increase in property taxes
1366309 if the state is going to tighten its budget maybe the local governments will have to do the same thing
1366310 every branch of government ought to be looking at ways they can cut back
1366311 for a republican caucus that fancies itself as being tax cutters this is a hard decision to make but there are no good choices when youre 1 6 billion down
1366312 to come back now and say we dont have the money is awkward to say the least at this point we dont have a strategy
1366313 they just dont have the money to make up this shortfall
1366314 local governments are really having a hard time when youre talking about cutting budgets youre talking about cutting services
1366315 there are some systems that wont be able to handle it
1366316 the more we advance with the project the more we realize it has an important impact on the life of people and it has a great potential to be replicated in other places around the world
1366317 this is a crucial step to not only integrate technologies into the third world for beneficial resources but to make these resources available sustainably
1366318 merwan found that households use electric in line heaters for showering which are costly due to the electricity expenses and hazardous since you are prone to getting shocked
1366319 it is one thing to develop a technology in a university lab but another to develop it in the field with all of the uncertainties and unknown challenges that arent always technically and socially apparent
1366320 quetzaltenango is an urban community with significant economic activity that has little access to new technologies there is a lot of potential to create a local industry that will create jobs bring better products to the market and improve quality of life of the population
1366321 reach almost 1 000 homeowners including those in the middle class who historically dont qualify for these types of programs
1366322 this has always been looked at as a comprehensive housing recovery program
1366323 we always said it would be rolled out in july and as soon as we get word from hud it will become an even broader program
1366324 the mayor said wait a minute if we put it out just for people making 80 percent or less of the area median income the implication will be the recovery is based on a 1ow income base instead of a mixed income base
1366325 we want to make a new new orleans not the old new orleans where we had segregation based on income
1366326 we dont want houses jammed right up on top of each other
1366327 we want to keep our places as nice as everybody elses
1366328 when they were there before they were good people but we want to keep the standards of baker up
1366329 we said from the beginning that we wanted to do things that the locals are comfortable with
1366330 the idea is to create a community and a neighborhood somewhere where people would want to live and something the community wants to have
1366331 if we can get a quality project its something that would certainly help the city
1366332 but it does depend on whats going to be put there and how its going to be put there
1366333 i think its perfect to put people in something permanent to take them off the streets to take them out of trailers and give them some kind of stability
1366334 around this fall we will be looking at beating the bushes and responding to more public rfps
1366335 we see a lot of work for ourselves through january 2009
1366336 but i couldnt say what the middle to the end of the year will be like
1366337 these numbers are a continuation of weak conditions in the non residential construction sector
1366338 its likely we are several months away from a turnaround
1366339 were not subject to the volatile ups and downs in the commercial sector
1366340 the arizona market went so far down i dont know how long it will take for it to come back
1366341 we certainly expect uae work to continue and to pick up
1366342 a year ago lenders were a lot more interested in funding than they are now
1366343 my expectation is that this is not going to be as deep a downturn as in past decades
1366344 this course was a semi technical one with a real interesting chicane that first jogged left went down a hill and made a real tight right at the bottom
1366345 we needed a bit of recovery since we were only racing with five guys

1366357 a medida viola claramente os direitos humanos a luta contra o terrorismo est sendo combatida custa das liberdades tamb m na europa
1366358 o peso da hist ria explica que todos os novos pa ses defendam o mesmo programa liberal e que todos sempre tenham como causa comum os postulados tradicionais anglo sax es
1366359 a grande maioria dos encargos em prote o social continuam nas m os dos estados
1366360 a agenda neoliberal da ue mais simb lica que real n o se deve temer bruxelas porque nesse aspecto n o passa de um tigre de papel
1366361 depois de anos de ditaduras nossos padr es de direitos podem ser inferiores aos dos pa ses europeus mas n o conv m exagerar foi toda a europa que virou para a direita n o se trata apenas do leste
1366362 as regras s o quase sempre liberais e no momento n o h nenhum projeto pol tico que tenha a aspira o de comand las

1366374 nadie puede sustituir a abby ni dentro ni fuera del campo vamos a echarla en falta por supuesto pero contamos con varias jugadoras fant sticas que van a tener la oportunidad de incorporarse al equipo han apuntado buenas maneras en los entrenamientos y tenemos mucha confianza en ellas

1366378 creo que en este torneo todos los equipos son buenos y no va a ser sencillo para nadie sabemos que debemos empezar fuerte pero nos hemos esforzado en los entrenamientos y estamos listas para hacer un buen f tbol

1366381 has received nearly 2 million in contributions from payday lenders
1366382 in current dollars they would buy 650 worth of salary by writing a check for 500
1366383 theres so many pieces to this that not even full time employment can help people meet those needs
1366384 there are a lot of programs but not a lot of availability
1366385 because of that people coming into the shelter are given a thick package of applications to fill out within a day of arriving so that eligibility can be quickly determined
1366386 it means the difference between having to struggle hard to pay for housing and making it
1366387 even when you do qualify you usually are put on a waiting list
1366388 tends to be higher in bangor and portland but might be shorter in less populated areas with less demand like presque isle
1366389 there are a number of people who have come to the city for help with housing and who are maxed out on their credit cards its a cushion a false cushion theyre mortgaging their future hoping that things are going to get better
1366390 it really depends how much they have invested in the learning process
1366391 some people say thats presence or its conferencing and it becomes a challenge to explain it to them
1366392 different companies will take different approaches and adopt different elements of the total package

1366395 there are vendor industry analyst and customer definitions from our perspective unified communications is about a move from siloed communications to enhancing business processes
1366396 five years ago we were talking about combining data and voice networks
1366397 now we are adding mobility systems and linking features such as presence email and videoconferencing its a gradual process
1366398 ciscos approach is that the network infrastructure is a key component of the overall system
1366399 many organisations already have our networking infrastructure in place so our approach is to ensure you can put other applications and features on that
1366400 a router provides conversion to all types of protocols and that is what we see our value as being having the network as a platform with all the quality of service that you need then you plug in to any applications that you want
1366401 companies have to realise that they dont have to take a big bang approach to all this
1366402 often organisations will find they already have the equipment and applications they need its just a matter of using the features
1366403 unified communications is all part of the convergence of both real time and non real time communications applications
1366404 a lot of ip telephony vendors have a uc offering that starts with a hardware centric approach
1366405 we want to highlight the fact that uc should be independent of any device and that the user experience should be universal
1366406 it certainly gets harder when you go deeper into linking with existing business applications
1366407 larger business application vendors are working with ip telephony providers to create the links and ensure they work
1366408 fresh new talent has grown up with instant messaging and mobility and they expect these facilities to exist within their workplace
1366409 they expect collaboration tools as a normal part of life and the companies that offer them will be more attractive as employers
1366410 running voip means that we only require one outlet per workstation also we can easily move people around to different workstations
1366411 if we unplug a phone and plug it in somewhere else it works you dont need to call out a technician every time and incur reconfiguring costs
1366412 because voip transmits voice calls in packets any loss can lead to a degraded service but we have not found this to happen
1366413 people dont even necessarily know that we have moved to voip as it is behind the scenes and just works

1366498 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1366499 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1366500 the key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1366616 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations
1366617 i knew i was going to have to try to battle through it and try to get the ball down
1366618 we need to get a good nights sleep in our own beds and come back out tonight and bounce back
1366619 das hei t es fahren noch massenweise diesel vom pkw bis zum lkw als partikelschleudern ber unsere stra en
1366620 rote und gelbe plaketten die viele der nicht nachger steten diesel erhalten sind wohl nicht der richtige weg die luftreinhaltung nach vorne zu bringen
1366621 dass ausgerechnet der ort mit den zwei gro en automobilkonzernen vw porsche und daimler der schmutzigste platz in sachen luftreinhaltung in deutschland ist
1366622 nach stuttgart mogeln obwohl sie nicht mal die rote plakette haben
1366623 wir wissen dass er ein schleichendes gift ist also hinter einem diesel ohne partikelfilter nicht gleich jemand tot umf llt sondern dass sich die krankheit langfristig entwickelt
1366624 ein zehn oder x krebsf lle vermeiden lassen mag f r professoren eine interessante diskussion sein f r uns ist jeder fall einer zu viel
1366625 mit den neuen gastronomen wird das angebot an gaumenfreuden noch einmal erheblich erweitert
1366626 im vergangenen jahr hatten wir vier tage lang optimale wetterbedingungen und etwa 600 000 besucher
1366627 am freitag geht der himmel immer wieder auf und zu
1366628 wir m ssen am wochenende nicht ganz auf die sonne verzichten aber ich w rde an allen vier tagen einen regenschirm mitnehmen
1366629 ich habe noch nichts ber eine hochzeit von lindsay geh rt aber wenn sie sam heiratet denke ich nicht das sie mich fragen w rde ob ich mit ihr den gang in der kirche langschreiten w rde sie kennt meinen religi sen glauben sie w rde nicht fragen
1366630 ich will das sie gl cklich gesund und auf dem richtigen weg bleibt wenn ich ber ihre beziehung reden soll sage ich das ich sie gl cklich sehen will
1366631 communists like us the idea of the west in the soviet union
1366632 how the idea of the west was employed and deployed by soviet politicians in order to define the meaning of communism
1366633 deploy ed a form of orientalism in which asia was cast as a separate and primitive realm to be distinguished from both the west and their own nations
1366634 categories animated and employed in the service of an attempt to create a novel political identity and national project
1366635 i would cast doubt on the utility of conceptualising his work as an example of hybridity at all rather than importing or translating a ready made idea of the west fukuzawa actively fashioned a certain representation of the west to suit his own and in large measure his social classs particular political ambitions
1366636 actively constructed rather than merely mirrored deconstructed or mixed a series of stereotypes of self and other
1366637 a misguided form of modernity for it represented the despoliation of personality and individuality by an increasingly standarised and industrialised social system
1366638 western colonialism had become the paradigm for all human contact
1366639 to have been created re invented and re valued by asians themselves
1366640 men seem to feel the need to tell me that a lot
1366641 i get great tits all the time but thats not the way to get into my pants get me interested in you take your time i promise you itll be worth it besides we have all night
1366642 once i found out about my sexuality i wanted to have sex all the time
1366643 just because i love sex doesnt mean i dont like to be treated right
1366644 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1366645 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1366646 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1366647 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1366648 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1366649 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1366650 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1366651 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1366652 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it
1366653 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1366654 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1366655 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1366656 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
1366657 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1366658 both ads were foul poisonous and emanated from the upper reaches of the republican party
1366659 both were designed to exploit the hostility anxiety and resentment of the many white americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women
1366660 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1366661 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1366662 playing to the annoyance some whites feel at being reminded of racial sins committed long before they were born
1366663 its hard to imagine how mccain could possibly win unless he generates doubt in voters minds about obama
1366664 obama understands that in order to be elected president he has to come off as the least aggrieved black man in america
1366665 from soulless to slacker idea of west from pan asianism to asian values asia and west
1366666 1 to illustrate how anti westernism of the old left has been recuperated by radical islamism and 2 to exemplify how radical islamism constructs a dystopian model of west
1366667 dystopian images of the west developed within both radical islamism and some of its putative forbears
1366668 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1366669 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1366670 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1366671 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1366672 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1366673 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks

1366676 back in the days when i was a teenager before i had status and before i had a pager you could find the abstract listening to hip hop my pops used to say it reminded him of bebop
1366677 so jet to the store and buy the lp on j i v e unfortunately
1366678 now we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate
1366679 it was nothing out of the ordinary for a big show
1366680 the war is crazy right now my aunties over there so wed love to see them come back real soon
1366681 can my vote count for two or something since im a celebrity
1366682 he was like im the most hated on so he wanted to do a mixtape with me kind of like the two most hated on or something like that
1366683 everybody is always picking on us anyway we might just go head and kill the game and sh on all these n as do a mixtape album together put it out and go hard
1366684 you know im going to check into this whole vampire thing
1366685 did i do this wrong is this a rule i didnt know about
1366686 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do
1366687 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks
1366688 use the stove to heat us powdered eggs and government cheeses the calendars with martin jfk and jesus

1366703 i think people will be shocked when they see all piled up in one place the kind of illegal fire power our police have removed from the hands of criminals
1366704 but i want people to see these guns to underscore the importance of cities and city officials working together to reduce illegal gun violence
1366705 as a former assistant prosecutor ive seen the damage illegal guns can do to communities
1366706 now as chair of public safety and neighborhoods i appreciate that the mayor is taking this a step further and asking for city council support in joining the coalition this is a step we can take together as a city in our ongoing effort to ensure the safety of kansas citians
1366707 nunca hab a visto un cartel con tanta tecnolog a
1366708 la idea de que un m vil anunciase la feria emeritense
1366709 los que nos quedamos las vamos a disfrutar del 29 de agosto al 5 de septiembre
1366710 ellos van a ser los patrocinadores del primer premio y parte del jurado
1366711 para que todo el mundo sepa que estamos en la capital auton mica
1366712 todos juntos podemos hacer que la feria de m rida sea la m s importante de extremadura
1366713 this is the first instance that i know of where a media company has taken over the management of an industry association
1366714 these arent the roving rotten flesh kind that only exist in the movies these zombies are beautiful and popular they use blood from the living to maintain their own appearance of being among the living
1366715 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
1366716 and the lord called his people zion because they were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there was no poor among them
1366717 therefore verily thus saith the lord let zion rejoice for this is zion the pure in heart
1366718 seek to bring forth and establish the cause of zion
1366719 notwithstanding the corruptions and abominations of the times and the evil spirit manifested towards us on account of our belief in the book of mormon at many places and among various persons yet the lord continued his watchful care and loving kindness to us day by day and we made it a rule wherever there was an opportunity to read a chapter in the bible and pray and these seasons of worship gave us great consolation
1366720 the place which is now called independence is the center place and a spot for the temple is lying westward upon a lot which is not far from the courthouse
1366721 anyplace where the saints gather is zion which every righteous man will build up for a place of safety for his children
1366722 we ought to have the building up of zion as our greatest object the time is soon coming when no man will have any peace but in zion and her stakes
1366723 let every one labor to prepare himself for the vineyard sparing a little time to comfort the mourners to bind up the broken hearted to reclaim the backslider to bring back the wanderer to re invite into the kingdom such as have been cut off by encouraging them to lay to while the day lasts and work righteousness and with one heart and one mind prepare to help redeem zion that goodly land of promise where the willing and the obedient shall be blessed

1366742 we are really pleased that graham has chosen to stay especially after a lot of interest from other counties
1366743 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country
1366744 to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area
1366745 im delighted to be staying at durham i love playing for the club and the decision to stay was an easy one to make
1366746 its been a great environment for me to develop my game and the set up here has been great for me over the years
1366747 the team is definitely going in the right direction and i want to be able to play a major part in the clubs continued success
1366748 unfortunately available conventional methods of treatment for pain and dysfunction following neck surgery often have limited benefits leaving much room for improvement

1366767 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1366768 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1366769 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1366770 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1366771 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1366772 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1366773 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1366774 ik ben zeker in de markt maar niet voor relatie en ik wil zeker niet meer voor voetbalvrouw worden uitgemaakt dat was toch wel het grootste nadeel aan het vak n it meer een voetballer
1366775 well ill just pick up the ps3 and mgs4 separately
1366776 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
1366777 well ill just pick up the ps3 and mgs4 separately
1366778 were gonna test this out on the consumer then discontinue it
1366779 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1366780 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story
1366781 last gasp of a party without ideas hamstrung by a politically weakened president and fully understanding that they are going to lose a significant number of seats in november
1366782 most of this foundation money goes to charity groups uninvolved in politics and policy but tens of millions of dollars find their way to policy advocacy groups on the left and even some on the right
1366783 parents ask only for schools that are safe teachers who are competent and diplomas that open doors of opportunity
1366784 when a public system fails repeatedly to meet these minimal objectives parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children
1366785 no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
1366786 although it might benefit some kids at the top what youre going to do is leave a lot of kids at the bottom
1366787 we allowed for 25 percent this will be substantially more than that our average cost for diesel fuel in 2007 was 2 38 a gallon our most recent purchase was 4 09
1366788 people who build affordable housing tend to support the democrats who support affordable housing

1366790 in a week i get maybe six to nine republicans and im getting 20 people a day
1366791 it hit me like a ton of bricks my thought was rehab for another week or two because ive been a guy that plays through pain and fights through injuries when they told me i was done it was pretty hard for the first day and a half
1366792 when i look back after im done its players like chris gray that make it absolutely worth it to do this to coach hes that good a guy
1366793 no es culpa del chanco si mo del que le da el afrecho
1366794 thanks for the most memorable holiday and what a superb villa
1366795 it is important to not only use the existing fleet of ice breakers but also to build new ships and the first nuclear ice breaker of a new generation will be built by 2015 this should be an ice breaker capable of moving in rivers and seas
1366796 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
1366797 this dispute is not only about oil reserves which might or might not exist it is about the control of sea lanes russias movements could pitch it into a serious territorial dispute with the us for the first time
1366798 four of the five arctic powers are nato members yet nato seems ill configured to be able to respond to the sort of activities we have seen from the russians we need to ensure nato has the will and the capability to deter russian activity that contravenes international laws or treaties
1366799 the intransigence of great britain has not permitted that open and frank dialogue
1366800 in 1990 all oil production was stopped in east germany as it was not profitable
1366801 now with prices increasing six fold the boom is so big that there is a shortage of oil experts exploration teams are booked out for many months in advance and drilling equipment is totally unavailable for purchase on the market
1366802 responde estrictamente a razones particulares y nada tienen que ver con informes de la sigen u otros organismos
1366803 obviously i find these remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible and i repudiate them i did not know of them before reverend hagees endorsement and i feel i must reject his endorsement as well
1366804 do we still need to point out that for hagee and his associates jesus can return only after armageddon and to this end it is best if israel continues to be at war hagee and his lobby is not impartial they reject the two state solution and direct their funding and assistance toward a clear political agenda in israel
1366805 we jews and israel are not alone because of you and the tremendous leadership of dr mcvety and dr hagee
1366806 theres a broad spectrum on the evangelical meter charles may be representative of one end probably one extreme end of that spectrum
1366807 that both israelis and palestinians have legitimate rights stretching back for millennia to the lands of israel palestine both israelis and palestinians have committed violence and injustice against each other the only way to bring the tragic cycle of violence to an end is for israelis and palestinians to negotiate a just lasting agreement that guarantees both sides viable independent secure states
1366808 that the boundaries of the land promised to abraham and his descendants will be literally instituted my emphasis and that jesus christ will return to a literal and theocratic jewish kingdom centered on jerusalem
1366809 theres no reason why we cant do the same thing in every major city of north america
1366810 the weather has been one means which the lord has used to remind man that he is god and to call man to the attention of the times
1366811 although america along with many other nations stands guilty of a multitude of sins pressuring israel to divide gods land is a terrifying example of blatant arrogance and lack of respect for his covenant with israel such pressure invites weather patterns that bring devastation the roadmap to peace in the middle east has in fact become a roadmap to terror and destruction
1366812 that upwards of six million jewish people are still dwelling or sleeping like jonah in north america
1366813 the time of the u s a being a safe haven for the jews has ended
1366814 we dont throw them overboard like jonah but lovingly assist them home to israel
1366815 god will help gentile neighbours to help jews to come home
1366816 if these experts suggest the world is moving closer to doomsday then what time is it on the prophetic calendar
1366817 and you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not frightened for those things must take place but that is not yet the end
1366818 even these developments can be seen as fitting into the prophetic timetable
1366819 international push for a palestinian state may well become the political slippery slope that leads eventually to world war 3 or in the biblical scenario to armageddon
1366820 the liberals fighting so hard to keep sex with 14 yearolds legal
1366821 i also dont think its fair to say that everybody who has concerns about israeli foreign policy is anti semitic if that were true three quarters of the population of israel would be anti semitic by the prime ministers definition
1366822 israels greatest friends and most important defenders are not the fundamentalists and extremists and those who take their orders directly from god but those who work for an end to this terrible conflict
1366823 dispensationalists are supporting some of the most dangerous elements in israeli society
1366824 is ignoring or defying gods plan for the end of the age
1366825 jeremiah declared that the jews must return to israel before messiah comes
1366826 dispensationalists could use the same argument as anti semites but claim they were not being anti semites
1366827 given the opportunity many german jews would have become nazis

1366935 stop printing lies about the jerusalem post the post sports writers and editors did their own leg work and had never seen this web site when they investigated the league back in june before your man elli called up to complain
1366936 the web site uploaded the ap story about the shortened season without asking me and when i saw it it was taken down because it clearly contradicted our story
1366937 so to confirm the post never printed any ap story without confirming the details until the last one about the exhibition games
1366938 the web site uploaded the ap story about the shortened season without asking me and when i saw it it was taken down because it clearly contradicted our story from the end of may which exclusively confirmed that the ibl will definitely not be hapening
1366939 the tabloid baby story simply of april did not quote anyone just had sources saying it
1366940 in terms of leg work if you read that story above you will see that alex spoke to all the relevant people himself rather than taking any information from this web site
1366941 we also published a number of features criticizing the ibl during the season last summer
1366942 the same day that alexs article was published i titled my weekly column
1366943 i admit the post has not been following the ibl problems since the end of last season as closely as this blog but we havent had the resources to do so and it is a nightmare getting hold of anyone involved in the ibl anyway
1366944 ive waited this long but it has now become a joke ive decided i am going to have to publicly expose the jerusalem post for the disgusting appallingly run cheapskates that they are
1366945 it has been 5 months since i wrote a story for the paper and i still havent been paid their excuses and the way i have been treated is not only appalling it is embarrasing for a newspaper of its supposed stature
1366946 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
1366947 the average annual salary in the computer engineering field is more than 100 000 meanwhile we have a robust supply of high iq baristas and college graduates with jobs that a generation ago would not even have required a high school diploma
1366948 at least on the emotional level contemporary american education begins by treating children as psychologically fragile beings who will fail to learn and worse fail to develop as whole persons if not constantly praised the self esteem movement may have its merits but preparing students for arduous intellectual ascents arent among them
1366949 we rank the manufacture of self esteem above hard won achievement but we also have immersed a generation in wall to wall promotion of diversity and multiculturalism as being the worthiest form of educational endeavor we have foregrounded the redistributional dreams of social justice over heroic aspirations to discover invent and thereby create new wealth and we have endlessly extolled the virtue of sustainability against the ravages of progress do all that and you create an educational system that is essentially hostile to advanced achievement in the sciences and technology

1366953 i taught myself brewing from books and asking questions like a lot of people i started with home brewing when my children were growing up the next step was to learn more about the art of brewing which enabled me to turn my hobby into a very successful business my wife and i started swale brewery in sittingbourne in 1995 and then moved to grafty green near maidstone at the end of 2001 we exported our award winning beer to america sweden and denmark
1366954 saisons are sturdy farmhouse ale that was traditionally brewed in the winter to be consumed throughout the summer months not so long ago it was close to being an endangered style but over recent years theres been a massive revival especially in the us this is a very complex style many are very fruit in the aroma and flavor look for earthy yeast tones mild to moderate tartness lot of spice and with a medium bitterness they tend to be semi dry with many only having touch of sweetness

1366956 ionuca i m gonna move now don t start crying
1366957 the traditional lambic is a beer whose spontaneous fermentation cannot be controlled entirely by the brewer due to the influence of many factors the taste and the aromas of our product are different every time we brew in a lambic brewery every bottling about 50 each season at the cantillon brewery results in a beer with its own more or less complex taste these differences are one of the characteristics of the gueuze kriek or framboise the lambic beers are blended in order to neutralize these differences and to be able to offer our customers a beer with a harmonious taste the whole season through the lou pepe beers deviate from these principles the gueuze lou pepe is made with two years old lambic beers with a mellow taste often coming from barrels in which only wine has been kept before in july the same kind of beer is used to make the lou pepe kriek and framboise with these beers too the fruits are soaked in barrels coming directly from bordeaux the second fermentation of these particular beers is not caused by the addition of young lambic but of a sweet liquor the yeast will transform the sugar in carbon dioxide all the lambic beers which are used are brewed in the same season and the use of liquor instead of young lambic makes the taste of the fruit more intense the kriek and the ros de gambrinus contain 200 g of fruits per liter on an average while the lou pepe beers contain about 300 g this fruity taste combined with the wine flavour coming from the bordeaux barrels distinguishes these special beers from the other cantillon products the particular name of these beers comes from the south west of france a region the cantillon family is very fond of in this beautiful region the grandfather is called lou pepe to his grandchildren florian simon louis and sylvain the master brewer is the lou pepe of the north

1366981 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

1367102 truly truly i say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has passed out death into life john 5 24
1367103 you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is these that bear witness of me and you are unwilling to come to me that you may have life john 5 39 40
1367104 for this is the will of my father that every one who beholds the son and believes in him may have eternal life and i myself will raise him up on the last day
1367105 and the witness is this that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he who has the son has the life he who does not have the son of god does not have the life
1367106 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give eternal life to them and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out of my hands

1367112 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body according to what he has done whether good or bad
1367113 for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of god for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god so then each one of us shall give account of himself to god
1367114 how long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply while the transgression causes horror so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled
1367115 for 2 300 evenings and mornings then the holy place will be properly restored
1367116 therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
1367117 now once at the consummation he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
1367118 and their sins and their lawless deeds i will remember no more
1367119 therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body
1367120 entered the most holy place once for all by his own blood having obtained eternal redemption

1367128 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme i respect scolari as a man and a great coach the coach now needs to find the optimum team and help the players achieve their best form
1367129 scolari has enough players to change the scheme of the game he will be able to judge the best strategy

1367217 my opinion is that maybe the single parts werent understood
1367218 so this is a good time to look at what people want
1367219 this is custom artwork from an upstate new york artist valuable one of a kind pieces its one thing to google maps another to commission and build artwork for a space
1367220 if you go to salem massachusetts historical homes boats slips are there everything was put back but the canal
1367221 theres a quiet interpretation there we needed something strident here because nothing was here but the canal what you see here is clean but built on the basis of history these are footprints of what used to be here
1367222 although market conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations
1367223 we have been able to sell licenses to india bangladesh france spain the u k the united states and canada
1367224 when you read through the books there is no mention of islam allah or the koran
1367225 i used an islamic archetype but the actual stories dont show any islam because they are based on values that we all share
1367226 are based on religious archetypes like the prophets from the bible they are all orphans superman left his parents on the planet krypton and batman sees his father and mother gunned down in front of him
1367227 the goal is to teach children that there are 99 ways to solve a problem
1367228 even though there are approximately 50 female superheroes only five will be covered in that way
1367229 i want to send the message out that there is not only one way to be muslim
1367230 when you hear these stories of saddam hussein who was cast as a hero and then ended up torturing his own people you ask yourself what kind of message we are sending our kids about what a hero does
1367231 with the 99 i wanted to make a difference and give muslim kids positive role models
1367232 tenemos un respeto mutuo el uno por el otro y un amor que siempre estar ah

1367236 story ideas are a dime a dozen really good ones are a nickel a piece
1367237 you cant possibly think we could display this christine its an abomination its completely unacceptable
1367238 if its above you than just say so i certainly hope you dont expect me to apologize for creating something that is beyond you
1367239 beyond me its beyond any sane person its globs of green paint swirled on a canvass its hopeless meaningless and in no conceivable way is it art of even the most pedestrian kind all you have done is ruin a perfectly good canvass and waste most or all of your green paints
1367240 perhaps i was wrong to try something so bold so soon i can hardly expect you to be able to grasp something so large without even an introduction its like trying to explain a color to a blind man or describe a sound to someone who is deaf you have no frame of reference how could you possibly understand all there is to see and feel in this
1367241 perhaps another medium might be more appropriate as always i am at your disposal but if you wish me to display your work you must give me something more accessible to the people works such as this
1367242 home work you must be joking youll be lucky to avoid the hospital if you keep this up and what was that thing you gave to duvall my god christine that thing was a monstrosity youre lucky he didnt have done with you the moment you placed it within his sight
1367243 what in gods name are you talking about christine there is a dead girl in your bed what the hell is going on here
1367244 what of it she will be remembered what greater gift could anyone have given her she will be remembered as i will great art requires great sacrifice
1367245 i have given her everything i have given the world the soul of a goddess and you call it nothing you are a heretic and you should be burned for such blasphemy life is nothing life is a drop of water in the ocean a grain of sand in the desert it means nothing death is eternal remembrace is eternal nothing else matters nothing
1367246 my students thought i was cooler for dressing like them i had sold my soul for shoes
1367247 hi jadore im curious how do you imagine that your own familys experience relates whatsoever to the experience
1367248 hey emily someone actually linked your site to me after i made a post about lakhanis new book let me
1367249 what can i tell you that you will understand i have more names than there are grains of sand in the deserts and drops of water in the seas i am everything and nothing i am the one who closes the door and turns out the lights when everything is over if you must call me something it might as well be god
1367250 im sorry i really am as with most of your race you lived your life as if you would go on forever there is no forever this is the end
1367251 no this isnt happening this isnt real this cant be happening i dont except it i wont no no no no no no
1367252 why not you why not now your people lived as if every question in the universe had an answer and you had some right to know what that answer was life is a journey not a destination all journeys have an end but not all get where theyre going some just stop time is like that and now its going to stop if i could make you understand i would but im not what you think i am the truth is if you cant find an answer to the really important questions inside yourself then there probably isnt one at least not one that matters your own hearts are the only gods that really matter im sorry you never learned that
1367253 well i guess this is it then not what i expected
1367254 asked me to establish corporate everything for it to the extent possible
1367255 i wont comment on how we got to 9 11
1367256 but i can comment on how weve improved since that
1367257 la memoria de mi marido fue perjudicada porque algunos testimonios lo mostraron como un hombre d bil y f cilmente influenciable
1367258 as you think about the presidential race and how you are going to vote do you find yourself focusing more on what kind of president you think barack obama would be or more on what kind of president john mccain would be
1367259 when it comes to your vote for your chosen candidate would you say that you are excited to be voting for him you are satisfied to be voting for him or you are voting for him as the lesser of two evils
1367260 in order to win this election obamas challenge seems less that he needs to overcome john mccain rather he needs to overcome doubts voters have about himself this election is clearly more about barack obama than it is either about john mccain or even president bush
1367261 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1367262 the business case for enterprise blogs it is still personal knowledge management
1367263 weblogs help unearth peoples wealth of knowledge and expertise in a way that databases management contents systems search engines etc cannot
1367264 i feel one of rod boothbys underlying points is that km is about facilitation rather than about managing knowledge as such its about creating the right environment for knowledge to flow
1367265 social bookmarking inside the organisation connecting people to people and to information

1367269 i cannot agree more wholeheartedly with adam gilchrists suggestion that the time has come for a concerted push for cricket to become an olympic sport
1367270 the olympic games would provide the perfect platform to showcase the game to a larger audience drawing in new fans and helping drive cricket development in emerging cricket countries
1367271 2020 might seem like a long way away but we need to start the process now i dont agree with most of the critics arguments and i believe their fears are misplaced we need to embrace twenty20 fully
1367272 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1367273 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1367274 im delighted to be staying at durham i love playing for the club and the decision to stay was an easy one to make
1367275 its been a great environment for me to develop my game and the set up here has been great for me over the years
1367276 the team is definitely going in the right direction and i want to be able to play a major part in the clubs continued success
1367277 we are really pleased that graham has chosen to stay with us especially after a lot of interest from other counties
1367278 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team
1367279 to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area
1367280 i can dial in from my cell phone and get on the emergency network and technically could do that from anywhere in the world
1367281 maybe this should have been done sooner but now that its here its a pretty compelling thing
1367282 when england changed captains it did suggest to me that they might be vulnerable but you should always beware the wounded lion
1367283 we are expecting a huge backlash from england they have new leadership a new direction they are all going to want to impress kp so we are expecting a really tough challenge
1367284 kp is going to bring a lot to the job he has had challenges thrown at him all along the way and he has always seemed to come out doing really well he seems to thrive on it
1367285 it will be a huge challenge to him does it affect his batting what is his vision going to be
1367286 there is no feeling among us that pietersen is still one of ours
1367287 he made his decision it has clearly been a good move for him and he is regarded as the enemy now we cant claim him
1367288 i dont know what reaction there has been in south africa but i am pretty sure there will be some proud people there people who have probably had an influence in kps career somewhere down the line
1367289 we had probably the best atmosphere i have ever experienced in the dressing room on saturday night in birmingham
1367290 it was amazing but today we have had a chat about getting our feet back on the ground there is one more test to play and we will take this one very seriously indeed
1367291 we are a very goal driven side and we want to become very ruthless we want to be a resilient team and this is part of the journey
1367292 for us there is no dead rubber no dead test match it is about playing to the best of our ability come thursday
1367293 we have been able to tick one box but we are looking to improve on our performances all the time to become the complete package which i dont think we are yet
1367294 we decided not to risk dale steyn in this match had it been 1 1 we would have had that plaster cast cut off but now he will be ready and firing in our warm up games for the one day series
1367295 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1367296 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1367297 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1367298 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1367299 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1367300 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1367301 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1367302 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1367303 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1367304 as a group of players weve got to perform weve got to put some pressure on south africa
1367305 by far this was one of the best test matches i have been involved in ive lost a few hairs on my head and a couple of nails it was definitely not a boring test match it was brilliant one
1367306 the wicket wasnt offering a lot and it was pure attrition teams would have had to take risks to push forward
1367307 in 2007 the ice was 1 3 metres thick on average compared with 2 6 metres in 2004
1367308 they just see it as trendy because people talk about it
1367309 unfortunately they glamorise it but theres nothing glamorous about losing your teeth and your hair and the sores
1367310 britney is doing her utmost to stay out of the limelight and lay low and just focus on her work
1367311 she thinks by ditching her elaborate pink wigs and bad boyfriends it will help her case

1367313 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere the australian quoted professor mallavarapu as saying
1367314 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
1367315 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
1367316 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
1367317 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
1367318 training in major abdominal surgery has been deficient as evidenced by the results of the surgical cases under his care
1367319 cyberbullying is much worse because you cannot see the bully and its a 24 7 thing you cant get away from it
1367320 schools are struggling with this issue because youre dealing with a students private space but they know they cant just ignore cyberbullying
1367321 we are seeing school systems address this problem in various educational programs and those will continue to grow in number and in content
1367322 we need to get the message out that heart attacks on the screen arent what people experience
1367323 we identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1367324 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1367325 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important
1367326 punjabi diet is very rich compared to the diet the population living in southern part of the country it is for this reason that we are witnessing people at young age getting heart attacks
1367327 she got strict instructions she was told to only have a little bit of orange juice and a big coffee in the morning which would make her go to the bathroom
1367328 then she was told to keep sucking down coffee all day until at least 3 p m when she could eat lettuce with a tiny bit of tuna with a drop of mayo
1367329 dinner is a tiny square of broiled fish about 2 inches long and a glass of wine
1367330 its possible to learn the habits of learning these things dont just happen in high school they need to be slowly learned
1367331 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviour are unlikely to increase they may even decline
1367332 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection
1367333 the air ambulance for many of the islands is the only ambulance service
1367334 it is important that this issue be re examined as part of the action plan currently being drawn up by the sas
1367335 the one hour 25 minute travelling time from inverness makes it impossible for orkney residents facing life threatening emergencies to get the care they need take as an example someone suffering a stroke they must have a ct scan and medication within 2 hours it just cant be done
1367336 given local concerns over any future reorganisation of gps on the different islands it is even more important for peoples confidence that they feel they can be moved quickly if they need help
1367337 we need a giraffe birth to learn how to be independent
1367338 we are really pleased that graham has chosen to stay with us especially after a lot of interest from other counties
1367339 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team

1367341 im delighted to be staying at durham i love playing for the club and the decision to stay was an easy one to make
1367342 it should be seen as a sign that the family is healing
1367343 i looked out the window and saw the car flipping head over end i began to see headlights and tail lights flipping
1367344 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organisation will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity
1367345 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment
1367346 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1367347 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus

1367358 we found papers on one of the suspects saying that their religious beliefs are more important than their lives the prosperity of their families and even the well being of their mothers they were trying to perform a jihad
1367359 one of the men lost his arm in the explosion the other is already on trial we recovered nine grenades two long knives two daggers and a gun

1367365 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1367366 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1367367 vaccine science is still more of an art than a science

1367369 he was never injured seriously he was cut on the lip twice and then the board hit his cheek and the skin burst he is as crazy as you can be out there and still be sensible
1367370 we want to make sure that seabirds seals or whales are not impacted
1367371 birds are doing nesting prospecting and we do not want them frightened away from their habitat
1367372 thats one of the reasons the organizers encouraged people to watch the contest online
1367373 we were at the end of the beach and the waves came and washed over everyone people and their babies

1367385 teens are tire kickers they hang around cost you money and then leave
1367386 not the least of which is that they hang around
1367387 when i was sitting around with friends and we said were not going to hang out at the
1367388 plus she said she wanted to find a community where she could discuss her interest in getting an eye lift
1367389 theres a recognition that this generation now uses the internet just like younger people
1367390 the one thing this generation hasnt done yet is network online
1367391 ive discussed my divorce my medical issues and when do i dare go dating again
1367392 i sure wouldnt discuss that stuff with a 20 year old
1367393 they dont even know who aretha is shes the queen of soul
1367394 my feeling on myspace is that people give you a poke and then theyre gone and you never see them again
1367395 for where two or three come together in my name there am i with them
1367396 and let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching

1367399 i never thought i would see you with a child
1367400 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1367401 it definitely was a high quality game but we still have a long way to go
1367402 tonight was a chance to see where we stand and i look forward to seeing them again
1367403 for me its about intensity and getting better every day and weve done that this is a great win for us
1367404 publicando conhecimentos cient ficos para a melhoria do cotidiano do cidad o
1367405 under the new vending system there should be more choices for consumers from whom they want to buy electricity to how much energy they want to use a day
1367406 im the nice one its her you have to worry about
1367407 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1367408 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1367409 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1367410 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1367411 we all need to get away for three or four days
1367412 maybe it is a good time it will help some guys get healthy
1367413 we were hoping to get a good win or at least a point out of it going into the little break but now we have to regroup
1367414 we had half our starting lineup out its going to be nice to get people back regroup and get set for our last push to the playoffs
1367415 its been a tough two years it takes time to build a team
1367416 look at houston how long have they been together four years since san jose now that weve built this core we trust each other well fight for each other and when the going gets tough were still going to put in the minutes for each other
1367417 we talked about it at halftime if we dug a little bit deeper put in a little more effort we would create good chances
1367418 we had decent possession we had decent chances unfortunately we didnt put them away
1367419 you work so hard to get the chances in the first place youve got to keep plugging away you cant think its not going to be your night because if you do youve already lost the game
1367420 we didnt finish well and making two substitutions because of injuries we couldnt make the moves we wanted tactically
1367421 last week we probably didnt deserve to be walking out with points saturday we deserved to walk off with points last week we got three this week we got none so it all evened out in the end
1367422 but my husband refused to come shopping with me and i figured this was the most evil thing i could do to him legally
1367423 the reason has to be because we have to repeat everything to men
1367424 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way
1367425 were trying to solve a crisis of confidence would this do it
1367426 if they stop buying the agency debt then yields would increase
1367427 knows the markets hes seen parts of this movie before
1367428 send a message to the markets that it wasnt just a someday aspiration but those confidence building measures are in place right now before tokyo opens on sunday night
1367429 the markets care as much about the governments comments about us especially in this market
1367430 if theres any kind of mixed message during a very volatile market it could be very detrimental to the gses and therefore the economy
1367431 you develop a pretty simple straightforward set of priorities and marching orders
1367432 local matters generally speaking should be left to the locals
1367433 local matters generally speaking should be left to the locals
1367434 i think congress has got an awful lot to keep up with
1367435 i know that good people were doing what they thought was best
1367436 not being part of the situation not being in the senate at that point he did not want to pass judgment
1367437 he feels some decisions need to be made by families under state and local government
1367438 isnt it like shooting a burglar in your house whos trying to harm your family
1367439 the whole case is going to be the harlan dwyer show
1367440 were gonna look like patsies if it doesnt have the right ending
1367441 theres always gonna be folks on the jury that are sympathetic to dwyers position on the bigger issue
1367442 this would all cost me a fortune in the united states
1367443 you can barely afford to live in the united states anymore
1367444 but basically theyve kept our family finances from falling off a cliff
1367445 if you need help living or coping this is the place to be i dont know that there is such a thing back in the united states and certainly not for this amount of money
1367446 its the same danger you have of going across the border looking for cheap medications
1367447 if you dont know what youre getting and youre not getting it from people you trust then youve got an accident waiting to happen
1367448 thats not to say these doctors here arent good but they dont have the same facilities and the technology

1367451 it is worth noting that separation resulting from sectarian cleansing was not the chief cause of the reduction in violence as some have claimed much of iraq remains intermingled but increasingly peaceful and whereas a cleansing argument implies that casualties should have gone down in baghdad for example as mixed neighborhoods were cleansed casualties actually went up consistently during the sectarian warfare of 2006 cleansing may have reduced the violence somewhat in some places but it was not the main cause

1367471 if fishing were eradicated in the end there would be a lot less people caring about fish
1367472 but there has been a decline in the popularity of fishing in recent decades according to a report by the sporting goods manufacturers association the number of people in the usa who fish declined from 58 4 million in 1987 to 47 9 million in 2004

1367556 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1367557 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1367558 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1367559 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1367560 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1367561 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1367562 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1367563 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1367564 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1367565 want ing the troops that are there to get as much as they can
1367566 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained
1367567 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
1367568 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
1367569 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
1367570 that details of the interception first published in a newsweek cover story were leaked by none other than colonel north himself
1367571 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth
1367572 many other reporters were mad at me but some commentators rightly pointed out that some values the obligation of reporters to their readers superseded the reporter source relationship and that if you used that relationship as a cover for lying you broke the implicit contract
1367573 in this instance where the source publicly accuses someone else of leaking a story for devious purposes its incumbent upon you to set the record straight
1367574 if a shield law is put in place irresponsible journalists can print anything and get away with destroying lives
1367575 on the night of the sept 11 attacks did the white house medical office dispense cipro to staff accompanying vice president dick cheney as he was secreted off to the safety of camp david
1367576 convinced that he had been subjected to a lethal dose of anthrax
1367577 actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
1367578 there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
1367579 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
1367580 w hat we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted six years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
1367581 that there was a network of people who were promoting a theory about anthrax that helped make the case for war
1367582 join s those who believe that some kind of congressional investigation is in order
1367583 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
1367584 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
1367585 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
1367586 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on
1367587 especially since dry spores were not something that we prepared or worked with
1367588 i cant imagine him being involved in a scheme to make money or to make a profit especially one that would put people at risk or even die
1367589 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
1367590 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
1367591 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
1367592 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
1367593 i am struck by the fact that there appears to have been at least two previous people who were pointed to who appear to have been patsies steven hatfill being one and ayaad assaad being another
1367594 he did not know if the investigation involving ivins is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be
1367595 sobre todo de la ley de la fuerza armada nacional bolivariana y la ley general de bancos esas que son pol micas
1367596 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1367597 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1367598 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1367599 the only limit on our involvement was prime minister malikis rightful concern that the operation was seen by the people of basra to be iraqi led
1367600 it is nonsense to suggest that this hampered uk support to the operation
1367601 if we look at the themes that have been driving the c dollar during the last couple of weeks now number one is that weve seen a fairly substantial weakening in commodity prices especially crude oil
1367602 the market is paying a little more attention to that because the last few corrections in crude oil have been very short term and fairly shallow
1367603 more protracted in terms of time and a lot larger in terms of the magnitude of the corrections
1367604 were starting to see economies in the u k europe and japan for example start to exhibit weakness
1367605 people are beginning to get worried we are going to see reduced demand for commodities which obviously filters back into negative sentiment for the c dollar
1367606 generally we remain bearish on commodity currencies including the cad
1367607 commodity stock liquidation has led to a broad outflow of funds from commodity related equity markets
1367608 the combined effects of the continued pullback in commodity prices alongside further usd gains not unrelated events in themselves has seen some of the g10 commodity linked currencies come under considerable pressure
1367609 since july 21 the cad has fallen 4 1 percent the kiwi is down 5 0 percent and the aud is off 6 1 percent
1367610 for nearly six years my client has not been able to work travel or even pick up a package at the post office or open a bank account since he lacks any form of identification papers
1367611 be up to the state to draw any potential conclusions
1367612 the government has a strong wish to carry out the expulsion as quickly as possible but this will have to happen within the boundaries of norways international human rights obligations
1367613 we will not stop watching over our entire people and no one not even you will be able to take this responsibility from us
1367614 to rejoice over victory by violence is to rejoice over slaughter the wise ruler sees a military triumph as a funeral
1367615 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
1367616 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
1367617 men honor what lies within the sphere of their knowledge but do not realize how dependent they are on what lies beyond it
1367618 what a man desires to know is that i e the external world but his means of knowing is this i e himself how can he know that only by the perfection of this
1367619 to realise the relative validity of ones convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly is what distinguishes a civilised man from a barbarian
1367620 because he really was a good father and a good husband
1367621 everybody has a right to their own personal safety and im going to punish him for hurting you

1367624 the custom and practice of the department regarding coffee consistent with the department rules was that if an officer wanted coffee and there was none the officer should make coffee for him or herself
1367625 he was frequently not given the proper training required to allow him to successfully complete his assignments
1367626 our allegation is that he was able to perform all functions of his job without any accommodation he passed whatever testing requirements there were and his mid level supervisors took it upon themselves to discriminate against him
1367627 if cox were given a position as a trainee that luthers would not be going easy on cox
1367628 did not make the same statement with regard to the other four new trainees
1367629 as a healthcare provider we want to reflect a healthy environment
1367630 they have the right to smoke but everyone should have the right to clean air
1367631 theyve pushed the setback demarcation line back from the middle of the creek which we always thought was crazy to the edge of the creek
1367632 i think its a good location its bigger and with a good remodel i think it will serve our needs
1367633 this reduced the height of this building at this visible corner by 11 feet and significantly reduces the mass of the project as seen from south jameson lane
1367634 now they are responding to the fact that they were trying to pull the wool over the commissioners eyes with respect to floor area
1367635 some critics of this project well never be able to make them happy
1367636 the mbar montecito board of architectural review said we are consistent with the buildings in the neighborhood the montecito association has said our project is consistent with the montecito community plan and the county staff has said our project is consistent with the community plan all the people who look at these types of things and provide their guidance to the montecito planning commission have all said our project is consistent with the montecito community plan
1367637 its going to be like fine dining but everything is to go
1367638 the food will be very fresh and there will be something for everyone vegetarians vegans meat lovers pastry lovers and there will be a small grocery store with items from around the world that are really hard to find
1367639 we hope someday to have the whole building as a museum and to do a 15 or 20 year lease was just too long
1367640 they were still interested and felt they could do well in a 10 year period
1367641 maybe 10 years from now well have some different ideas ten years is a long time
1367642 lets confront at home the things that we find odd curious wrong shameful ignorant and unfortunate abroad for my money tbn is a much bigger popular problem than the new perspective and post modernism maybe 10 of my folks know anything about these things maybe 10 but nearly the entire congregation dips into tbn on occasion or has someone who appears on that channel that they appreciate but who is less than sound on critically important issues
1367643 we are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings because we intuit and feel immediately and without argument the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder

1367664 deadworld has always been more about the people and how they interact rather than a simple zombie chase and this story allows me to use my science background reed teaches college biology to explore things in this direction but i always thought it should have a certain art style and when sami was available i knew the time was right
1367665 when joe pruett desperado publishing asked me if i was interested to do a deadworld story arc i was like yes very interested i have been a big fan of romeros zombie movies a long long time and soon as i started to really study realistic illustration style it was always like some day i m going to do a comic that includes the dead walking all i did was drawing zombies for couple of years and then some more so for me this is one dream come true my approach for the illustration style will be darker when compared to blue my last comic project this is a post apocalyptic world with nearly no hope in sight so it just has to be the script gary has written is a challenging and yet fun to draw there is a lot cool stuff to do gas masks laboratories piles of bodies and of course the zombies
1367666 its a nice variety of stories set in deadworld but not in the continuity of the series itself
1367667 we feel it is important to provide open source developers with a platform to showcase their new and innovative applications to help them cultivate beneficial business relationships

1367669 many pull boxes are built with the wire looped within the pull box often resulting in tangles and snags our bulk wire pull boxes overcome this problem through the use of an innovative plastic frame work that supports the wire positioned on the reel resulting in a smooth glide that is gentler on the cables as well as less harsh on the box itself

1367720 this is by far the toughest schedule that we have played since i have been at ju
1367721 we are playing five teams that competed in post season last year so it will be a good test for us to gauge where we are as a program
1367722 our goal is to be playing in the ncaa tournament in march so we feel the best way to prepare us to reach that goal is to compete against great competition in our non conference games
1367723 hopefully this will put us in a position to win the a sun conference and tournament
1367724 after getting beat so bad by tennessee i was taking inventory of that game
1367725 as i looked around i was seeing that everybody was kind of waiting on someone else to do something coaches and players i was getting kind of mad at them until i looked in the mirror and realized they were just basically reflecting me i was sitting there waiting for somebody to do something
1367726 i realized that if we dont play with emotion which we usually do but didnt that day i said something has got to change i knew it had to start with me
1367727 there have been people saying march richt is a true gentleman of the game

1367744 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1367745 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1367746 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1367747 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1367748 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1367749 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1367750 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle

1367944 ke arah industri pertanian produktif dan komersil melalui amalan dan teknologi mapan
1367945 ekspo ini juga memberi ruang kepada orang ramai dan para pengusaha pertanian di sandakan dan daerah berdekatan lain mengetahui teknologi dan amalan pertanian moden dalam meningkatkan produktiviti terutama tanaman makanan ternakan dan perikanan
1367946 bagi mereka yang berminat tetapi tidak mempunyai modal satu taklimat susulan mengenai pembiayaan diadakan selepas tamat seminar
1367947 selain itu kita menerangkan kepada para peserta tentang cara cara menternak cacing dengan cara betul bagi mendapatkan hasil yang memuaskan sebelum dijual
1367948 mereka meminta kebenaran saya untuk meletakkan kaki dalam kolam lintah bagi tujuan perubatan
1367949 di sini saya mendapat idea untuk menjalankan usaha bekam menggunakan lintah
1367950 pesakit akan didaftarkan terlebih dahulu dan diperiksa mengenai penyakit yang dihidapi selepas itu kaki pesakit akan diurut menggunakan mesin bagi merangsang peredaran darah
1367951 selepas itu pesakit akan akan diletakkan dalam kotak mandi wap selama setengah jam bagi mengumpulkan toksik
1367952 lintah akan dibiarkan menghisap darah sehingga kenyang dan berhenti sebelum luka dibersihkan menggunakan antiseptik
1367953 kami mengutamakan keselamatan pesakit dan lintah yang telah digunakan akan dimusnahkan
1367954 pesakit yang menjalani rawatan bekam lintah mengakui keberkesanannya dan hampir semua datang lagi
1367955 antaranya mereka datang biasanya menghadapi masalah senggugut gout sakit kepala sakit pinggang bengkak resdung kencing manis dan barah payu dara
1367956 rusa tidak memerlukan kandang yang besar seperti kambing atau lembu tetapi cukup dengan kawasan lapang dan beberapa batang pokok besar sebagai tempat mereka berteduh
1367957 malah kos makanannya juga kecil kerana saya menggunakan campuran hampas soya sawit dan pelbagai jenis buah buahan yang diambil dari pasar berdekatan
1367958 sejak memelihara rusa secara komersial saya hanya mengeluarkan hanya beberapa ratus ringgit sebulan saja untuk ubat cacing dan vitamin
1367959 jika penternakan diusahakan di kawasan yang terlalu luas mungkin penternak terlepas pandang anak rusa yang disorokkan
1367960 ini dapat mengelakkan anak rusa daripada mati kelaparan jika tidak dijagai ibu mereka
1367961 harga tanduk jantan basah boleh mencecah sehingga rm500 dan yang kering pula menjangkau rm3 000
1367962 biasanya pekerja saya menemui tanduk yang gugur dan tentu saja sukar jika rusa diletakkan di ladang ternakan yang luas
1367963 dagingnya sama seperti rusa dan saya lihat haiwan berkenaan berpotensi untuk dipelihara di sini
1367964 mereka boleh berkongsi satu petak dengan rakan dan membeli beberapa ekor rusa untuk diletakkan di dalamnya
1367965 kami hanya akan mengenakan kos penyelenggaraan yang minimum bagi satu petak serta kos makanan rusa
1367966 setiap minggu pemilik boleh membawa makanan sendiri untuk diberikan kepada rusa mereka malah mereka juga boleh membawa balik beberapa hari
1367967 saya juga boleh memantau ternakan yang dibeli dapat penjagaan yang betul dan pada masa yang sama pemilik boleh mempelajari cara penternakan yang betul

1367972 kami bukan sahaja didedahkan dengan teori dan praktikal bagi menternak keli malah bengkel komprehensif ini turut memberi gambaran dan panduan yang jelas dari sudut merangka pelan perniagaan mendapatkan pinjaman dan juga sehingga ke aspek pemasaran ujar sarpan saibani 37
1367973 peluang tersebut membolehkan sesiapa sahaja boleh memulakan projek ternakan keli dengan modal minimum sebanyak rm25 000
1367974 walaupun bengkel ini hanya diadakan selama tiga hari tetapi penerangan yang diberi nyata padat ringkas dan menyeluruh
1367975 kami juga didedahkan tentang teori dan praktikal seperti habitat ikan teknik pensenyawaan penjagaan pengairan sehinggakan bagaimana untuk membina kolam ujarnya
1367976 pada pandangan saya peserta yang terlibat mempunyai peluang yang lebih cerah untuk melaksanakan projek ini
1367977 ini kerana berteraskan kemampuan serta kriteria yang diperlukan panduan lengkap telah diterapkan kepada peserta secara lengkap katanya

1368053 great horny toads say yer prayers you long eared galoot
1368054 is much more explicit than any recommendation out there right now
1368055 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1368056 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1368057 there is uncertainty about whether the benefits exceed the harm based on existing evidence
1368058 most of the harms are related to treatment rather than screening
1368059 men under the age of 75 should try to make an informed choice at this time
1368060 the current evidence is not enough for us to know the balance between benefit and harm
1368061 that discussion should occur before screening occurs and should include what the test does and does not mean the consequences of finding cancer and the uncertainty about whether benefit exceeds harm based on current evidence
1368062 will not sit well with oncologists and a lot of people
1368063 as medical oncologists we are always trying to be one step ahead of the cancer
1368064 we are trying to intervene earlier and identify patients who are at risk we always want to intercede to do something
1368065 these patients are very informed and their view will be at odds with the recommendations
1368066 these are not the 75 year olds of 50 years ago these are physically younger people still actively functioning sexually in many cases
1368067 we are starting to make recommendations that some people be screened by the age of 35
1368068 the american cancer society since 1997 has been against mass screening
1368069 but within the physician patient relationship a test should be offered to the patient with the patient informed of the potential risks and potential benefits so he can make an informed decision
1368070 but we are in the process of re evaluating our recommendations for men of all ages

1368120 cammino lungo gli scaffali della biblioteca i libri mi voltano la schiena non in modo ostile ma invitante come a volersi presentare metri e metri di libri che non riuscir mai a leggere e lo so vita che mi si offre in aggiunta alla mia che sta l ad aspettare solo di essere sperimentata ma con la velocit con cui scompaiono i giorni le possibilit rimangono inutilizzate uno solo di questi libri basterebbe a cambiarmi la vita chi sono adesso chi sarei dopo
1368121 maka apabila mereka naik kapal mereka berdoa kepada alloh dengan memurnikan ketaatan kepada nya maka tatkala alloh menyelamatkan mereka sampai ke darat tiba tiba mereka kembali mempersekutukan alloh
1368122 kemudian alloh menerangkan bagaimana tauhid kaum musyirikin tatkala mereka berada dalam mara bahaya dan ketakutan yang mencekam yakni ketika mereka berada di atas bahtera pada saat mereka ditimpa ombak yang besar ditengah lautan mereka meninggalkan sesembahan mereka yang lain dan mereka hanya berdoa kepada alloh semata sebab mereka yakin bahwa yang hanya bisa menolong mereka pada saat itu adalah alloh semata maka tatkala mara bahaya itu telah hilang dari mereka dan alloh selamatkan mereka sehingga mereka sampai di daratan maka tiba tiba saja mereka kembali mempersekutukan alloh dengan tandingan tandingan padahal tandingan tersebut mereka yakini tidaklah mampu menyelamatkan mereka
1368123 gunung merapi adalah mbah ini dan itu yang menguasai jembatan ini pohon ini dan yang menyuburkan pertanian adalah mbah anu dan lain sebagainya lalu diantara mereka ada pula yang apabila akan ditimpa kesusahan atau mara bahaya tidak meminta tolong kepada alloh
1368124 dan sesungguhnya masjid masjid itu adalah milik alloh maka janganlah kamu menyembah seorang pun didalamnya di samping menyembah alloh
1368125 barang siapa yang mati sedangkan dia membuat tandingan tandingan untuk alloh maka dia masuk neraka
1368126 dan bahwasanya ada beberapa orang laki laki di antara manusia meminta perlindungan kepada beberapa laki laki di antara jin maka jin jin itu menambah bagi mereka dosa dan kesalahan
1368127 orang yang paling menyesal di akhirat kelak ada tiga seseorang yang memiliki hamba yang kelak pada hari kiamat hamba tersebut membawa amal lebih baik darinya seseorang yang mempunyai harta tidak menyedekahkannya lalu mati kemudian orang lain yang mewarisinya dan bersedekah dengannya dan seseorang yang berilmu tapi tidak bermanfaat mengetahui orang lain yang sama sama berilmu tapi bermanfaat
1368128 pada tahun tersebut manusia shalat ashar pada hari arafah dengan pakaian musim panas kemudian angin bertiup kencang cuaca menjadi sangat dingin hingga mereka harus menghangatkan badan dengan api dan airpun menjadi salju
1368129 sesungguhnya allah hanya pada sisi nya sajalah pengetahuan tentang hari kiamat dan dialah yang menurunkan hujan dan mengetahui apa yang ada dalam rahim dan tiada seorangpun yang dapat mengetahui dengan pasti apa yang akan diusahakannya besok dan tiada seorangpun yang dapat mengetahui di bumi mana dia akan mati sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
1368130 karena kebiasaan orang orang qurasy yaitu kebiasaan mereka bepergian pada musim dingin dan musim panas
1368131 wahai uqbah saya tidak akan makan hidangan anda sampai anda bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan selain alloh dan saya adalah rasul nya
1368132 demi alloh aku tidak rusak aku lakukan hal itu karena pada perjamuan makan itu ada seorang tamu ia tidak mau menyentuh makananku sebelum aku bersaksi di hadapannya aku malu jika ada tamu yang keluar dari rumahku sementara ia belum memakan hidanganku
1368133 aku tidak rela aku tidak ingin melanjutkan hubungan perdagangan ini denganmu sampai kamu menyatakan keluar dari agama muhammad nyatakan hal itu di hadapannya caci maki dia di hadapan orang banyak satu lagi ludahi wajahnya
1368134 kelak engkau akan keluar dari makkah dari bukit sebelah itu dan aku akan menyambutmu dari bukit sebelah itu pada saat itu engkau menyesali perbuatanmu
1368135 dan ingatlah hari ketika itu orang yang zhalim menggigit dua tangannya seraya berkata aduhai kiranya dulu aku mengambil jalan bersama sama rasul kecelakaan besarlah bagiku kiranya aku dulu tidak menjadikan si fulan itu teman akrab ku sesungguhnya dia telah menyesatkan aku dari setelah itu telah datang kepadaku dan adalah syetan itu tidak mau menolong manusia
1368136 untuk sukses saat ini diperlukan 4 hal yaitu satu duit dua uang tiga fulus empat money
1368137 dan bersabarlah kamu bersama orang orang yang menyeru tuhannya di pagi dan senja hari dengan mengharap keridhaan nya dan janganlah kedua matamu berpaling dari mereka karena mengharapkan perhiasan kehidupan dunia ini dan janganlah kamu mengikuti orang yang hatinya telah kami lalaikan dari mengingati kami serta menuruti hawa nafsunya dan adalah keadaannya itu melewati batas
1368138 dan sungguh akan kami berikan cobaan kepadamu dengan sedikit ketakutan kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan buah buahan dan berikanlah berita gembira kepada orang orang yang sabar
1368139 orang yang ingin mendapatkan keselamatan dan kesejahteraan abadi tanpa ujian dan cobaan berarti ia belum mengenal ajaran islam dan tidak mengenal arti pasrah diri kepada alloh azza wa jalla
1368140 dan kami coba mereka dengan nikmat yang baik baik dan bencana yang buruk buruk agar mereka kembali kepada kebenaran
1368141 boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal ia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal ia amat buruk bagimu alloh mengetahui sedang kamu tidak mengetahui
1368142 dan sesungguhnya kami akan memberi balasan kepada orang orang yang sabar dengan pahala yang lebih baik dari apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
1368143 mereka itu diberi pahala dua kali disebabkan kesabaran mereka dan mereka menolak kejahatan dengan kabaikan dan sebagian dari apa yang kami rizkikan kepada mereka mereka nafkahkan
1368144 tidak ada yang melata di bumi ini melainkan rezekinya ada di sisi alloh
1368145 para nabi kemudian orang orang shalih kemudian yang sesudah mereka secara berurut menurut tingkat keshalihannya seseorang akan diberi ujian sesuai dengan kadar agamanya bila ia kuat akan ditambah cobaan baginya kalau ia lemah dalam agamanya akan diringkankan cobaan baginya seorang mukmin akan tetap diberi cobaan sampai ia berjalan di muka bumi ini tanpa dosa sedikitpun
1368146 orang yang diciptakan untuk masuk surga pasti akan merasakan banyak kesulitan
1368147 di antara bentuk kehinaan dunia di hadapan alloh adalah bahwa manusia berbuat maksiat selama ia di dunia dan ia hanya bisa menggapai apa yang ada di sisi alloh dengan meninggalkan dunia
1368148 la ilaha illallah sesungguhnya di dalam kematian ada sakaratul maut
1368149 letakkan pipiku di atas tanah semoga alloh melihatku dalam keadaan demikian kemudian dia merahmatiku
1368150 saya menangis bukan karena dunia ini namun saya menangisi perjalanan setelah ini dunia bekalku yang sedikit lalu saya akan menapaki tempat yang menanjak lagi amat luas sementara saya tidak tahu akan dimasukkan ke neraka atau ke surga
1368151 tidak ada ilah selain engkau maha suci engkau ya alloh sesungguhnya aku adalah termasuk orang orang yang berbuat aniaya ya alloh aku mohon pertolongan dalam seluruh urusanku dan aku memohon kesabaran dalam menghadapi ujian yang menimpaku
1368152 apakah seseorang tidak mau beramal untuk mempersiapkan panggung pergulatan ini
1368153 bagaimana aku tidak menangis sementara aku tidak mengetahui bagaimana dosa dosa telah menyerangku
1368154 aku berkata kepada ummu harun seorang wanita yang rajin beribadah
1368155 demi allah andaikan aku berbuat kesalahan kepada makhluk saja maka aku takut untuk bertemu dengannya maka bagaimana lagi jika aku bermaksiat kepada khaliq yang maha agung
1368156 ya allah kasihanilah aku hilangakanlah kesedihan di dalam kuburku mudahkan kesulitanku ketika menjelang kematian rahmatilah kedudukanku di hadapan mu wahai dzat yang paling pengasih di antara para pengasih
1368157 kabar gembira buat anda karena anda adalah orang yang sangat bersungguh sungguh di dalam ketaatan kepada alloh azza wa jalla
1368158 janganlah kalian mengatakan demikian sesungguhnya aku tidak mengetahui apa yang tampak di hadapan alloh
1368159 dan jelaslah bagi mereka azab dari alloh yang belum pernah mereka perkirakan
1368160 maka ummu darda bertanya kepadanya tentang hal itu lalu beliau menjawab
1368161 demi alloh aku menangis bukan karena dosa yang aku ketahui telah aku lakukan namun aku takut jika telah melakukan sesuatu yang aku anggap sepele namun dihadapan alloh ternyata itu adalah sesuatu yang amat besar
1368162 tidak ada tempat yang lebih dahsyat bagiku daripada tempat terjadinya sakaratul maut aku sangat takut kalau dia sakarat terus menerus menekanku aku telah meminta keringanan namun dia tidak menghiraukan sehingga aku terkena fitnahnya
1368163 dosa lebih ringan dari pada ini tanah maksudnya adalah maut pen aku menangis karena takut terhadap suul khatimah akhir hidup yang buruk
1368164 di dalam kematian ada rahah istira hat bagi seorang mukmin dari huru hara dan hiruk pikuk dunia walaupun harus merasakan putusnya nafas dan kepedihan kemudian beliau mengu curkan air mata
1368165 si fulan sudah tidak dapat berbicara sudah tidak mengenali para tetangganya dan mulutnya tertutup rapat
1368166 wahai ayah tercinta siapakah yang akan mengasuhku nanti setelah ayah pergi siapakah yang akan memenuhi kebutuhanku nanti kita mendengarkan semua itu namun demi allah kita sudah tidak mampu manjawab lagi
1368167 bersiap siaplah kalian semua di dalam menghadapi kematian jangan sampai ketika ia datang lalu kalian minta di kembalikan lagi ke dunia karena belum beramal
1368168 hendaknya setiap orang dari kalian merasakan bahwa dirinya telah meninggal lalu memohon kepada alloh azza wa jalla untuk dikembalikan ke dunia kemudian allah memenuhinya maka hendaklah kalian beramal ketaatan kepada alloh azza wa jalla
1368169 manusia itu ada dua macam pertama orang yang terus mencari bekal di dunia dan ke dua orang yang terus bersenang senang di dunia maka lihatlah termasuk golongan yang manakah dirimu
1368170 apakah kalian tahu ke surga ataukah ke neraka kalian akan dimasukkan
1368171 jiwa yang lemah sedang urusan sangat dahsyat dan besar sesungguhnya kita adalah milik alloh azza wa jalla dan sesungguhnya kepada nya kita akan kembali
1368172 maukah kalian kuberi tahu dua hari dan dua malam yang belum pernah diketahui dan didengar oleh manusia yang masih hidup hari yang pertama adalah hari di mana datang kepadamu pembawa berita dari alloh
1368173 dimanakah istri si fulan dia akan melepas kepergian suaminya dan dimanakah anak anak yatim si fulan
1368174 dan demikian pula di antara manusia binatang binatang melata dan binatang binatang ternak ada yang bermacam macam warnanya dan jenisnya sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya alloh maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
1368175 kapankah seorang hamba itu takut kepada alloh subhanahu wa taala
1368176 jika ia mendudukkan dirinya sebagai orang sakit yang menahan didi dari berbagai hal khawatir jika sakitnya berkepanjangan
1368177 siapa yang takut terhadap sesuatu ia akan lari darinya tetapi siapa yang takut kepada alloh subhanahu wa taala ia justru lari untuk mendekatinya
1368178 siksa ku akan kutimpakan kepada siapa yang aku kehendaki dan rahmat ku meliputi segala sesuatu maka akan aku tetapkan rahmat ku untuk orang orang yang bertakwa yang menunaikan zakat dan orang orang yang beriman kepada ayat ayat kami
1368179 allah ridha terhadap mereka dan merekapun ridha kepadanya yang demikian itu adalah balasan bagi orang yang takut kepada rabbnya
1368180 dan takutlah kalian kepadaku jika kalian benar benar beriman qs ali imran 175
1368181 jika seorang mukmin melakukan suatu kemaksiatan ia pasti menindaklanjutinya dengan salah satu dari dua hal yang akan menghantarkannya ke surga takut akan siksa dan harapan akan ampunan
1368182 sesungguhnya orang orang yang berhati hati karena takut kepada robb mereka dan orang orang yang beriman kepada ayat ayat rabb mereka dan orang orang yang tidak menyekutukan rabb mereka sesuatu pun dan orang orang yang telah memberikan apa yang telah mereka berikan dengan hati yang takut karena mereka tahu bahwa sesungguhnya mereka akan kembali kepada rabb mereka mereka itulah orang orang yang bersegera untuk berbuat kebaikan dan merekalah orang orang yang pertama tama memperolehnya
1368183 aku pernah bertanya kepada rasulullah tentang ayat ini apakah yang dimaksud disini orang orang yangmeminum arak berzina dan mencuri
1368184 bukan begitu wahai puti as shiddiq tetapi mereka orang orang yang berpuasa sholat dan bersedekah mereka takut jika amalannya tidak diterima merekalah yang bersegera dalam kebaikan
1368185 duhai seandainya aku adalah sehelai rambut yang tumbuh di tubuh seorang mukmin
1368186 alloh subhanahu wa taala telah meramaikan berbagai kota dan membukakan berbagai negri dengan tanganmu
1368187 aku ingin kalau bisa meninggalkan dunia ini tanpa pahala dan tanpa dosa
1368188 sungguh aku pernah melihat para sahabat nabi pada hari ini aku tidak melihat sesuatu pun yang nenyerupai mereka di pagi hari mereka nampak kusut pucat dan berdebu di antara dua mata mereka seperti ada lutut kambing mereka menghabiskan malam dengan bersujud dab berdiri membaca ayat ayat alloh subhanahu wa taala gerakan mereka hanyalah antara kening dan kaki bila pagi tiba mereka pun berdzikir kepada alloh subhanahu wa taala bergemuruh seperti pepohonan tertiup angin yang kencang mata mereka bercucuran air mata sampai sampai pakaian mereka basah karenanya demi alloh subhanahu wa taala hari hari ini sepertinya aku menghabiskan malam bersama kaum ini dalam keadaanlalai
1368189 jika ia datang seakan akan ia datang dari menguburkan teman karibnya jika ia duduk seakan akan ia adalah seorang tawanan yang akan dipenggal lehernya jika berbicara tentang neraka seakan akan neraka itu hanya diciptakan untuknya
1368190 apabila sangkakala telah ditiup maka waktu itu adalah waktu datangnya hari yang sulit
1368191 mainly due to a decline in sales of mobile phones as the number of subscribers switching from other mobile phone operators to softbank became stagnant

1368196 under no circumstances is it reasonable for the government to confiscate something that is nearly 100 times more valuable than the amount owed
1368197 the governments proposed remedy will make things worse this man is disabled and mentally incapable of handling his affairs but at least he has a home that is paid off and some stability if they take away his home what will become of him will he be forced onto the public dole so that he can afford to rent a place will he become homeless and require space in shelters how much more than 50 will it cost the taxpayers if the city takes his home away
1368198 the probability of pricing dropping in the market would depend somewhat on the response to m1s broadband package we do not expect any overnight changes on this pricing it is going to be gradual rather than sudden
1368199 if singtel and starhub were to take away these three items then the pure retail service price for broadband could be lower
1368200 theres a lot of pressure on the accounting profession in this context theyve got to be able to assess plans change the direction of a company very quickly if need be
1368201 what we discovered through this crisis in the last year or so is that there have been poor management decisions companies have taken on excess debt and at times theyve made decisions based on inappropriate processes
1368202 number one is the risk management challenge to recognise a risk measure it and manage it the second is to develop within the organisation control mechanisms so that at all times were accounting for the funds of stakeholders appropriately and thirdly accountants are going to have to be part of the strategy for organisations
1368203 masalah baik dan buruk apakah keduanya ditentukan berdasarkan akal atau syariat wahyu
1368204 dan kami tidak akan mengazab sebelum kami mengutus seorang rasul
1368205 sesungguhnya alloh menyuruh kamu berlaku adil dan berbuat kebajikan memberi kepada kaum kerabat dan alloh melarang dari perbuatan keji kemungkaran dan permusuhan dia memberi pengajaran kepadamu agar kamu dapat mengambil pelajaran
1368206 perbuatan baik yang dilakukan oleh orang orang jahiliyah bukanlah suatu kebaikan hingga alloh memerintah mereka melakukannya melalui ayat ini dan bukan pula suatu keburukan apa apa yang dianggap tercela di kalangan mereka hingga alloh melarang mereka dan menyebutnya buruk dan dia hanya melarang perbuatan perbuatan yang kotor dan tercela
1368207 ketika alloh memerintahkan kepada nabinya untuk menghadapi kabilah kabilah arab beliau keluar dan menemui mereka pada suatu majelis dari kaum syaiban bin tsalabah
1368208 sesungguhnya alloh menyuruh kamu berlaku adil dan berbuat kebajikan memberi kepada kaum kerabat
1368209 demi alloh engkau telah mengajak kami pada akhlak yang mulia dalail an nubuwwah al baihaqi juz 2 h 422 425 dalail an nubuwwah abu nuaim juz 1 h 203 207
1368210 makhluk tidak mengetahui apa yang dicintai dan diridhai oleh alloh perintah nya dan larangan nya karamah nya yang dijanjikan kepada wali wali penolong penolong nya dan siksa nya yang dijanjikan untuk musuh musuh nya mereka juga tidak mengetahui hak alloh dari nama nama yang baik asma al husna dan sifat sifat nya yang agung yang akal tidak mampu mengetahuinya dan hal hal yang serupa dengan itu kecuali melalui rasul rasul nya yang telah diutus alloh kepada hamba hamba nya
1368211 maka ketahuilah bahwa tidak ada ilah yang haq melainkan alloh dan mohonlah ampunan bagi dosamu dan bagi dosa orang orang mukmin laki laki dan perempuan dan alloh mengetahui tempat kamu berusaha dan tempat tinggalmu
1368212 ikutilah apa yang telah diwahyukan kepadamu dari rabbmu tidak ada ilah selain dia dan berpalinglah dari orang orang musyrik
1368213 dan kami tidak mengutus seorang rasul sebelum kamu melainkan kami wahyukan kepadanya bahwasannya tidak ada ilah melainkan aku maka sembahlah olehmu sekalian akan aku
1368214 katakanlah hai manusia sesungguhnya aku adalah utusan alloh kepadamu semua yaitu alloh yang mempunyai kerajaan langit dan bumi tidak ada ilah yang brhak disembah selain dia yang menghidupkan dan yang mematikan maka berimanlah kamu kepada alloh dan rasul nya nabi yang ummi yang beriman kepada alloh dan kepada kalimat kalimat nya kitab kitab nya dan ikutilah dia supaya kamu mendapat petunjuk
1368215 dan kami tidak akan mengazab sebelum kami mengutus seorang rasul
1368216 mereka kami utus selaku rasul rasul pembawa berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan agar supaya tidak alasan bagi manusia membantah alloh sesudah diutusnya rasul rasul itu dan adalah alloh maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
1368217 dan tidaklah kamu muhammad berada di sisi yang sebelah barat ketika kami menyampaikan perintah kepada musa dan tidak pula kamu termasuk orang orang yang menyaksikan tetapi kami telah mengadakan beberapa generasi dan berlalulah atas mereka masa yang panjang dan tiadalah kamu tinggal bersama sama penduduk madyan dengan membacakan ayat ayat kami kepada mereka tetapi kami telah mengutus rasul rasul dan tiadalah kamu berada di dekat gunung thur ketika kami menyeru musa tetapi kami beritahukan itu kepadamu sebagai rahmat dari rabbmu supaya kamu memberi peringatan kepada kaum qurasy yang sekali kali belum datang kepada mereka pemberi peringatan sebelum kamu agar mereka ingat dan agar mereka tidak mengatakan ketika azab menimpa mereka disebabkan apa yang mereka kerjakan ya rabb kami mengapa engkau tidak mengutus seorang rasul kepada kami lalu kami mengikuti ayat ayat engkau dan jadilah kami termasuk orang orang mukmin
1368218 dan mereka berkata mengapa ia tidak membawa bukti kepada kami dari rabbnya dan apakah belum datang kepada mereka bukti yang nyata dari apa yang tersebut di dalam kitab kitab yang dahulu dan sekiranya kami binasakan mereka dengan suatu azab sebelum alquran itu diturunkan tentulah mereka berkata ya rabb kami mengapa tidak engkau utus seorang rasul kepada kami lalu kami mengikuti ayat ayat engkau sebelum kami menjadi hina dan rendah
1368219 di antara beberapa persoalan yang telah ditetapkan di dalam syariah adalah syarat menentukan suatu kewajiban taklif melalui suatu perintah di antara perintah perintah yang datang dari alloh syari adalah pengetahuan mukallaf tentang tuntutan syari pembuat syariat alloh kepadanya untuk melaksanakan perintah nya

1368281 once youre president everything changes there are wholly are different set of pressures and wholly different consistencies
1368282 youre no longer representing illinois or arizona but a national political party and an entire nation
1368283 a president is not just a free wheeler hes got to be a party leader
1368284 he cant lose his base but at the same time he cant just default to the base and let it lead him
1368285 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad

1368302 i strongly oppose the bush administrations nomination of thomas marcelle to be a united states district judge for the northern district of new york and encourage the senate to oppose his confirmation as a progressive democrat i cannot stand silent and watch the bush administration fill the federal courts with right wing republican political appointees who threaten such fundamental constitutional rights and principles as a womans right to choose separation of church and state and protection of our civil liberties i encourage all of my fellow democratic candidates to publicly state their position on mr marcelles nomination and join me in opposing such radical right wing appointees who are simply out of touch with mainstream americas values and positions on these critical issues

1368304 the ideal of empirical science based user centered design is something that we aspire to but never reach
1368305 if for example an eyetracker tells you that people dont spend time looking at your companys logo does that mean that you need a new logo or does it mean that your logo is already deeply familiar to the user
1368306 we dont issue dogmatic statements and impose dogmatic principles that is intervening and invading on the freedom of the conscience of the people when a person is christianity nurtured and his conscience is shaped by christian principles that person should have the freedom to manifest his or her attitude toward specific problems such as abortion or the forms of abortion the church does not get involved in that kind of detail jesus never never imposed anything upon his followers if you want to inherit the kingdom of god do this do not do this if you want that is the greatest characteristic feature of christianity the washington post 1 20 96 p b6 his holiness patriarch bartholomew of constantinople when he visited san francisco in 1990 made the following statement on the orthodox position on abortion although the orthodox church believes the soul enters the body at conception and generally speaking respects human life and the continuation of the pregnancy
1368307 respects the liberty and freedom of all human persons and all christian couples we are not allowed to enter the bedrooms of the christian couples

1368528 like wal mart large fast food companies can influence whole categories of suppliers by virtue of their purchasing decisions
1368529 so one way to think about fast food operations is to start with each ingredient and follow it through the supply chain to disposal or recycling for example we know that global seafood supplies are predicted to crash in the 2040s does the company sell fish species that are threatened does the company have good seafood supplier standards that are independently monitored does the company source shrimp that have been farmed with high levels of pesticides or antibiotics how is the fish processed transported and refrigerated what does the company do with trash and organic waste

1368541 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1368542 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1368543 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1368544 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1368545 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1368546 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1368547 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1368548 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1368549 maybe he feels there are just too many of those

1368559 the government should not be trying to bribe people into buying homes in a falling market
1368560 with the economy grinding to a halt we are likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make the situation worse
1368561 the falls we are seeing in the housing market are painful if necessary if homes are to become affordable for those not on the property ladder
1368562 if it helps to kick start some activity in our moribund housing market
1368563 the government needs to think more strategically about reforming stamp duty so that it better supports people moving and encourages institutions to invest in housing supply
1368564 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1368565 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1368566 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems

1368599 this is looking like a really fine series from the fantastic source of material
1368600 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance on monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1368601 if that doesnt happen we will be very loudly saying to the oil companies and the retailers why havent you brought the price down
1368602 and we would expect the accc to be asking a very similar question in a very public way
1368603 theres no magic wand to cut grocery bills overnight but enhanced competition can put downwards pressure on prices
1368604 in the short to medium term unit pricing will create greater price transparency in the medium to long term getting more entrants into the market will also help control prices
1368605 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down

1368610 i have experimented with this cake and my recipe has one variant to the original i add a liqueur to three milks pastel de tres leches 1 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder cup unsalted butter 2 cups white sugar divided 5 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract divided 1 cup milk of a 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk of a 12 ounce can evaporated milk 1 3 cup liqueur frangelico brandy or chambord for example optional 1 cups heavy whipping cream preheat oven to 350f degrees grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan sift flour and baking powder together and set aside cream the butter and 1 cup of the sugar together until fluffy add the eggs and 1 2 teaspoon of the vanilla beat well add the flour mixture to the butter mixture 2 tablespoons at a time mixing well until blended pour batter into prepared pan bake for 30 minutes when cake has finished baking pierce it in 8 or 10 places with a fork or skewer and let it cool combine the whole milk evaporated milk condensed milk and liqueur and pour over the top of the cooled cake refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving whipped cream topping when ready to serve combine the whipping cream and the remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 cup of sugar whipping until thick spread over top of cake because of the milk in the cake it is very important that you keep the cake refrigerated until ready to serve serve chilled version replace the sweetened condensed milk with cup of coco lopez cream of coconut in the milk mixture you can also add cup rum southern version in addition to the three milks add 1 3 cup peach schnapps you can add cup of diced drained peaches to the batter about cup of pecans can be added to the batter or sprinkled on top of the cake before serving now if you like cherries blueberries raspberries or apples you can add them to this cake much in the same way well what about chocolate why not add some chocolate syrup to the three milk mixture or temper in some white chocolate this is another one of those great recipes that allows for culinary adventure plus it is just plain delicious

1368703 this is clearly a very challenging period for businesses in northern ireland particularly as the impact of the global economic slowdown takes effect
1368704 at a time when firms are already suffering from the fall out of the credit crunch rising oil and energy prices are particularly unwelcome
1368705 moreover recent reductions in house prices have dampened consumer confidence
1368706 the strength of the labour market where the number of employee jobs stands at an all time high of 722 120 coupled with increased investment in r amp d will help many local firms retain their competitive position
1368707 businesses in key investment markets such as the us and europe are feeling the impact of the slowdown
1368708 however recent announcements such as bombardier aerospaces half billion pound investment in northern ireland illustrate the confidence that overseas investors continue to have in our economy
1368709 the bombardier project is the largest ever single investment in northern ireland by any company sustaining over 800 jobs and offering significant development opportunities to local companies
1368710 the current economic climate makes this more challenging and even more important in the face of the slowdown both public and private sectors need to re double their efforts to improve our productivity

1368725 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraq al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1368726 ive done this sort of thing for a while and in here the way it worked is there were off the record sources who laid out the story and then i went to people actually involved they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did

1368794 many investors are placing part of their hard earned money out of harms way into foreign banks that do not have exposure to the u s sub prime mortgage crises
1368795 the first step in establishing a foreign account is to establish an offshore company since many foreign banks will not open accounts directly with u s people or companies the next step is to open the bank account in the offshore company name
1368796 it is very important to note that u s people are taxed on worldwide income so this is not a tax avoidance strategy it is a fully reported financial diversification and asset protection move the u s and many other governments are cracking down on those whom use offshore trusts in an attempt to avoid paying taxes or hide money from their governments offshore company ensures that its clients offshore trusts are set up and filed properly and meet government legal requirements
1368797 dont try setting up an offshore trust by yourself unless you are experienced with offshore banking use a professional service that understands the offshore banking laws as well as the laws of your government remember the government will go after people that not only try to hide their accounts from the government but those that make mistakes setting up the trusts or improperly file the paper work as well ignorance is not an excuse that will save you from governmental action and when you are dealing with a large amount of money and very stiff penalties for mistakes why take chances

1368847 much of the recent increase in the fertility rate is likely to reflect the fact that over the last few decades younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having these postponed babies so called recuperation
1368848 this has shown up as higher fertility rates for older women
1368849 however some of the increase is also likely to be due to a quantum effect an increase in the number of babies women will have over their lifetimes
1368850 for this age group there has been a 7 2 per cent increase in fertility rates in the northern territory and a 3 2 per cent increase in south australia
1368851 this period coincides with the introduction of the baby bonus and the paper suggests the baby bonus may have stimulated teenage pregnancies in the northern territory
1368852 overall australia appears to be in a safe zone of fertility

1368884 im sure youre asked this question all the time pelosi constantly blitzer why did you immediately rule out impeachment i guess thats the thrust of his kris question pelosi i ruled out impeachment before the election in terms of a priority for the new congress impeachments always on the table depending on the behavior of the president of the united states but in terms of where we planned to go i said before the election that impeachment was off the table and for the following reasons our country has serious serious problems some of them springing from this presidents backward looking policies we came in we had our six inaudible six most of it is the law of the land relating to our energy bill raising the minimum wage having the biggest package for college affordability since the g i bill in 1944 the biggest increase in health care benefits for our veterans in the 77 year history of the veterans administration again the g i bill for afghan and iraqi vets coming home about education about energy policy about healthcare we just passed the medicare reform bill it was my view that the priority was to get something done for the american people blitzer and that impeachment would have been a diversion pelosi and that would have been a diversion of the time and it would have divided the country it would have divided the country should there be a look into the irresponsible use of power by the president of the united states taking us into a war on the basis of a false premise without a plan and how we would succeed and without a strategy to leave certainly and congress has had that oversight over and over again and we will continue to do so
1368885 look i am as confused as you are there is nothing wrong with sushant per se but in the two years that i have slept lived and breathed sushant i havent felt as wonderful or as alive as i feel when i am with vikram when i am with vikram i feel as if as if dreams are worth dreaming about i mean they can become real if you really want them to
1368886 you dream because you know you are going to wake up and all that will remain with you is a lingering memory which you carry with you into real life
1368887 what i have with vikram can never be permanent it is just a passing phase and i want to go with the flow he leaves the country in a couple of weeks and then who knows maybe some wintry night when loneliness sets in i will cuddle my baby to my bossom and think about this time spent with him if i dont have this what will i think of on that night a husband who is mostly away a bed which is warm only half the night the absence of a night lamp in my room or the blue glare from sushants computer screen

1368932 we are not seeking access to the communications between the vice president and the president we are seeking access to the communications between the vice president and fbi investigators
1368933 mr fitzgerald told us that there were no agreements conditions and understandings that limited mr fitzgeralds use of the interview in any way
1368934 this unfounded assertion of executive privilege does not protect a principle it protects a person
1368935 attorney general janet reno provided the committee the fbi interviews of both president clinton and vice president gore mr mukasey decided that a different rule should apply to republican presidents than to democratic presidents
1368936 fact that the attorney general is recommending the assertion of executive privilege reveals that this department of justice is as beholden to the white house as that run by former attorney general alberto gonzales
1368937 now i think the government through its questions really tried to put a cloud over vice president cheney
1368938 you know what wells said something here that were trying to put a cloud on the vice president well talk straight there is a cloud over the vice president he sent libby off to meet with new york times reporter judith miller at the st regis hotel at that meeting the two hour meeting the defendant talked about the wife plame we didnt put that cloud there that cloud remains because the defendant obstructed justice and lied about what happened
1368939 not going to protect one staffer sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his head in the meat grinder because of incompetence of others
1368940 if there is one document that could pierce the cloud hanging over the vice president this is it
1368941 the president was pleased to do his part to help the investigation move forward
1368942 no one wants to get to the bottom of this matter more than the president of the united states

1368947 doing the right thing even if it means losing friends
1368948 at a time when resources are more limited than ever it is great to see the creativity and collaboration between media specialists teachers and in some cases entire school staffs to bring the best to their students
1368949 it didnt matter if it was a rural school or an urban school a large school or a small school an elaborate project or a simple one the commitment dedication and implementation by the teachers and media specialists was incredible

1368960 alan gives us that experience quality and leadership and at the back he is a good talker
1368961 he will be skipper but as ive said on numerous occasions just because a player is wearing the armband it doesnt mean he is going to play every game alan is no different to anybody else he has to earn the right to be in the team
1368962 the responsibility at times may have played on savs shoulders a little bit too much some people can take to captaincy some people find it difficult to be perfectly honest i do not see it as a big deal personally
1368963 maybe it will give sav a bit less responsibility and a bit more freedom to go and express himself
1368964 as far as i am concerned everybody who goes on the pitch is a captain or they should be so it is about what we do on the pitch and not about individuals getting this or that
1368965 wherever i have been if anyone needed to ask anything or needed a bit of advice i have always been the first to offer it it is something i have always done with the younger players to try to help them because sometimes it is not easy and everyone reacts differently to pressure
1368966 we are going to try to take him on loan until the end of the season and are in the process of doing that deal
1368967 he can play wide right or left he is a good footballer and impressed me greatly and considering that was his first game for us against utrecht at the weekend i thought he equipped himself very well for the money it is costing us it is a gamble that is worth taking

1369119 the republicans action began as a stunt on friday and by monday had evolved into a well organized effort that might just succeed if enough pressure were brought on pelosi to force a vote on a comprehensive energy package she might have to budge either by bringing congress back in august admittedly a very long shot or by holding a vote when the house reconvenes in september

1369125 your dead shall live together with my dead body they shall arise awake and sing you who dwell in dust for your dew is like the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead
1369126 the lord kills and makes alive he brings down to the grave and brings up
1369127 i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death o death i will be your plagues o grave i will be your destruction pity is hidden from my eyes
1369128 and many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt
1369129 the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear his voice and come forth those who have done good to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation
1369130 paul was not trying to convince them that christ rose from the dead but that one day they too would be raised with him to eternal life
1369131 there never was a historical event established on surer evidence than that of the resurrection of christ
1369132 the radical change in his life a change which brought him persecution and suffering is certainly evidence that the lord had indeed been raised from the dead
1369133 the argument is if the dead cannot rise then christ did not rise for christ was dead 8
1369134 if the resurrection is eliminated the life giving power of the gospel is eliminated the deity of christ is eliminated salvation from sin is eliminated and eternal life is eliminated if christ did not live past the grave those who trust in him surely cannot hope to do so
1369135 when the priest waved the sheaf of the firstfruits before the lord it was a sign that the entire harvest belonged to him when jesus was raised from the dead it was gods assurance to us that we shall also be raised one day as part of that future harvest
1369136 jesus was the first one truly resurrected never to die again but many more will follow
1369137 but each one in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward those who are christs at his coming then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to god the father when he puts an end to all rule and all authority and power
1369138 he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead
1369139 when he jesus delivers the kingdom to god the father
1369140 there will be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and the unjust
1369141 and many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt
1369142 anyone not found written in the book of life was will be cast into the lake of fire
1369143 the first resurrection is the resurrection unto life because it is made up only of those who are saved the second resurrection is the resurrection unto death because it is made up only of unbelievers
1369144 if the dead do not rise let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
1369145 if the resurrection is not true then we can forget about the future and live as we please but the resurrection is true jesus is coming again
1369146 how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come
1369147 our future bodies may be material and identical with our present bodies and yet will be organized in a very different way
1369148 and as we have borne the image of the man of dust we shall also bear the image of the heavenly man

1369153 at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries which could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy
1369154 i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment
1369155 god lets the water out of the tub and it comes down
1369156 for over two years amazon web services has provided infrastructure services that help companies of all sizes from small startups to larger enterprises realize the cost time and scaling efficiencies of cloud computing we believe that cloud computing will continue to grow into a large industry with companies providing a range of different services
1369157 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
1369158 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts
1369159 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
1369160 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand
1369161 the acts of the holy spirit and the lives of the apostles
1369162 like our lords death at calvary pentecost was a once for all event that will not be repeated
1369163 be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins
1369164 for the promise is to you and to your children and to all who are afar off as many as the lord our god will call
1369165 the filling with the holy spirit is separate from the baptism of the spirit the spirits baptism occurs once for each believer at the moment of salvation but the spirits filling may occur not only at salvation but also on a number of occasions after salvation
1369166 did not become filled by lengthy prayer or an emotional experience
1369167 the filling of the spirit occurs when the believer walks in obedience to the word and spirit yielding to his control releases his power in the believers life
1369168 you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
1369169 those who after his example have proved the strength and genuineness of their faith in christ by undergoing a violent death
1369170 as the father has sent me i also send you
1369171 the early church understood the pattern for effective evangelism by consistently practicing that pattern they turned their world upside down
1369172 and daily in the temple and in every house they did not cease teaching and preaching jesus as the christ
1369173 to begin with they witnessed daily this meant that they took advantage of witnessing opportunities no matter where they were
1369174 the early church did not go about arguing religion or condemning the establishment they simply told people about jesus christ and urged them to trust in him
1369175 the term worship is misunderstood if it gives the impression that the major element is what human beings do or offer to god
1369176 worship is human response to a gracious god and it needs to be placed in this context if it is to be properly understood
1369177 the most high does not dwell in temples made with hands
1369178 the jews had become far too dependent on a physical place the temple for their worship
1369179 in resurrection he would provide the spiritual dwelling where god the spirit and people in spirit could have spiritual communion
1369180 the new testament believer offers god a living body set apart to god in an act of worship
1369181 they did not cease teaching and preaching jesus as the christ
1369182 so continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart praising god and having favor with all the people

1369184 youre talking about a young player who is trying to feel his way through a little bit
1369185 its a little bit of learning to play through some of that pain
1369186 if it doesnt get any better here pretty soon yeah well have to do something
1369187 i was almost the other day tempted to use newhan hes played a little bit in the outfield it even crossed my mind to use lance
1369188 the cunning of history the holocaust and the american future
1369189 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
1369190 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1369191 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
1369192 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
1369193 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
1369194 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
1369195 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
1369196 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
1369197 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
1369198 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
1369199 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
1369200 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1369201 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1369202 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1369203 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1369204 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1369205 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
1369206 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1369207 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1369208 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1369209 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
1369210 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
1369211 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
1369212 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
1369213 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
1369214 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1369215 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
1369216 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
1369217 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
1369218 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
1369219 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
1369220 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
1369221 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1369222 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1369223 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
1369224 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
1369225 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
1369226 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
1369227 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
1369228 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
1369229 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
1369230 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1369231 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
1369232 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1369233 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
1369234 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
1369235 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
1369236 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

1369245 about the middle of june 1917 and that much of the movie was filmed in howell
1369246 there was a log cabin there owned by the labardy family and this is where the state police made their debut as movie stars performing admirably all types of outstanding horsemanship
1369247 it is similar to what other banks have been doing recently where they have been having rights issues
1369248 but the 3bn is taxpayers money that is money that is very much at risk
1369249 was being forced to hand over yet more money in order to keep this bank afloat
1369250 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1369251 it doesnt have shareholders now that its owned by the government so its got to come to us so what weve said is that we will put in up to 3bn
1369252 weve got to get state aid approval for that so we cant give a precise figure but up to 3bn may be necessary
1369253 repaying the government loan is proceeding well ahead of target
1369254 this is the result of the success we are having with our redemption plan

1369266 indeed the nba isnt exactly hemorrhaging talent among the seven who took the leap childress a career reserve in atlanta who averaged 12 points last year was perhaps the most accomplished he received a surprisingly lucrative contract from olympiacos in greece that will pay him 13 million euros over three years the equivalent of 20 million tax free american dollars olympiacos was mentioned this past week as a club that wanted to be a player in the lebron james sweepstakes when the cavaliers star becomes a free agent in 2010 but the exodus is getting plenty of attention from agents and general managers because the european option is a timely development for some marginally talented players especially those who are ensnared in restricted free agency and theyll all tell you the same thing this show me the euro scenario may not be a trend but given the state of the american economy it could become one if a superstar player decides to takes the same course
1369267 if the nets do manage to sign potential free agent lebron james before the start of the 2010 11 season its possible their fans in new jersey could get the first look at him as opposed to those in brooklyn

1369269 that the exhibition games versus turkey and lithuania were routs for the americans didnt matter a bit to the 11 885 people who packed the arena the games which sold out within an hour from the time tickets went on sale were a firsthand opportunity to see the men who are considered the foremost practitioners of a sport that seems to be well on the way to becoming the regions national pastime according to the chinese basketball association cba some 300 million people are hooping it up amazingly those numbers are only expected to grow partially because of the olympics where pool play in the run for the gold medal opens with an incredibly titillating matchup the u s versus yao ming and the host chinese

1369326 i think it would be safe tp say that coming out of comptia breakaway cisco is thinking small and that perhaps some tighter synergy between cisco and linksys in the small business market is on the near horizon this of course would allow you to evangelize about the power of a broad product portfolio in such a diverse market
1369327 my appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless given my age and my level of experience in the city i wouldnt have thought that i would be so out of touch with reality
1369328 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
1369329 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
1369330 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
1369331 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
1369332 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
1369333 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
1369334 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
1369335 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
1369336 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
1369337 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
1369338 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
1369339 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
1369340 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
1369341 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
1369342 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
1369343 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
1369344 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
1369345 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
1369346 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
1369347 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
1369348 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
1369349 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
1369350 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
1369351 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
1369352 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
1369353 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
1369354 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
1369355 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
1369356 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
1369357 what do you do now youve got all the toys
1369358 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
1369359 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
1369360 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
1369361 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go
1369362 people like us dont put our hands in our pockets so much
1369363 eine abkehr vom ausstieg aus der kernenergie ist kologisch und konomisch sinnvoll und erforderlich
1369364 wenn die spd und bundesumweltminister gabriel wirklich die verbraucher entlasten wollen dann m ssen sie ihre ablehnung gegen ber der kernenergie aufgeben und den ausstieg vom ausstieg einleiten
1369365 set in post apocalyptic 2018 john connor is the man fated to lead the human
1369366 wow i made over 4 400 last month and didnt even budge from my chair its just amazing that my income keeps growing like this this system gives me the best odds of hitting a jackpot and when i do it will just be the icing on the cake
1369367 for the eight months may through december 2006 lotto magic paid me 7 150 02 for the months of january thru july 2007 lotto magic paid me 35 075 02 that is an average of over 5 000 00 per month for this year that is net after they withhold 50 00 per month for the next months play
1369368 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1369369 but he not only lived through it but by his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1369370 he is a great citizen of russia and my favorite writer
1369371 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1369372 people with his understanding of life were our last hope
1369373 today young children are growing up and they dont know anything
1369374 if you knew exactly how much time you had left to live life as you know it
1369375 we estimate that funds representing 13 billion ofcommitted capital have flat to negative internal rate ofreturns through july 2008
1369376 given the weakness in this quarters results we do notbelieve haverty will be able to remain profitable during fy08 representing its first loss making year since world war ii
1369377 we continue to see haverty as a survivor in retailfurnishings that will benefit from share gains when demandstabilizes
1369378 however wesee no imminent stabilization in demand causing us to stay onthe sidelines for now
1369379 he said that for all its misery russia retained a soul the west had lost
1369380 after a short spell of honors and greetings he became another object of mockery on whom the cynical young could look down and at whom the compromised elders could sneer
1369381 it is another country you cannot step in the same river twice
1369382 destructive and irresponsible freedom of western life including the excessive burdening flow of information from the media
1369383 it takes an obsessive personality to be a brave and constant critic of cruel dictatorships solzhenitsyn certaintly fitted that mould as did that other towering figure among the soviet dissidents of the 1960s andrei sakharov the physicist their refusal to compromise made them ill suited to any post revolutionary role
1369384 yet russia under vladmir putin has moved back towards the world solzhenitsyn believed in he was a nationalist a fierce defender of the russian orthodox church and convinced of the unique cultural role of russia in the world
1369385 the july 2 military operation that bloodlessly rescued 15 farc hostages on july 2 had worn an emblem of the international red cross
1369386 chevron views free trade and free trade agreements as extremely positive for countries throughout the world including colombia and the united states of america
1369387 hemos empezado a disparar ya los misiles son para la defensa no vamos a agredir a nadie
1369388 clearly we will confront a challenging businessenvironment in the second half of the year
1369389 while we expect our average selling prices to increaseacross all product lines in the specialty papers business unit we do not expect pricing to outpace rising input costs

1369398 there may have been multiple positions which were reclassified but they all appear to have been held by just one trader and this was a very special trader with an enormous concentration of positions in crude oil amounting to perhaps 460 million barrels and not much interest in anything else

1369405 i think i can agree with phidippus spp but i thought from the b j kaston book its the male not female of the genus that have the vertical eyebrow tufts from this photo its hard to tell if the chelicerae are iridescent which would further suggest male
1369406 there is nothing more exciting than the discovery of a new girl
1369407 the more we got interested in models and the more we got into the aspects tied to that profession the more we didnt just want the blog to be a simple gathering of nice pictures we started to transform it into something like an online daily newspaper concerning fashion models photographers and collections
1369408 we supported girls like edita vilkeviciute and viktoriya sasonkina long before they started to work for international shows like for example jil sander
1369409 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
1369410 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1369411 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1369412 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1369413 now we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate

1369417 the idea is you eat like our prehistoric ancestors who lived on raw food long before fire
1369418 ive worked with people with diabetes who found their insulin levels dropped after two weeks
1369419 raw is based on enzyme therapy cook above 47 c 116 f and your body greets the food as a foreign substance but raw food keeps all the enzymes at their maximum as you cook it increases toxins and kills off enzymes if you eat an enzyme less diet you are going to suffer
1369420 yet its hard not to believe the best diet isnt good old fashioned common sense steer clear of badly reared meat yes but give up greens roasted veg and ahem the odd quality steak ill leave that to macca and other culinary disciplinarians
1369421 the popular conception of bonhoeffer is of a theologian who would have done away with all the religious elements of the church and perhaps even with the church itself

1369454 some key bulls are leaner and more explosive coming out of the gates at the start of training camp south florida dual threat quarterback matt grothe might be extra dangerous scrambling around this year after losing some extra baggage in the offseason
1369455 when the university of south florida went through mondays first practice it was like no other season opening workout in program history for the first time the bulls began fall drills with a number before their name no 21 ranked usf
1369456 if the bulls have a successful season in 2008 they will no longer be shocking the college football world last season the bulls ascended from being unranked during the preseason to no 2 in the nation by oct 14 south florida faltered down the stretch but the bulls still finished with a 9 4 record including a spot in the sun bowl in el paso texas
1369457 as initial practices go monday didnt appear all that different from any first day in south floridas first 12 seasons as a football program nose around long enough though and theres an unmistakable air that didnt accompany the bulls in any previous august

1369471 listening to records used to be a time to be enjoy with a few friends hang out listen to the music and read the liner notes on the back
1369472 maybe you enjoyed the gatefold sleeves in a personal way maybe you just enjoyed slipping the sealing material off the cover on your pants by rubbing the corner of the record on your knee taking the record out getting that little
1369473 all formats have their points i just like handling vinyl i was a dj for years and used to use records to entertain in the philadelphia and new york area i didnt just play records we made a night of entertainment as for the digital sound i prefer the warmer sounds i get from vinyl
1369474 i do have a music collection and my favorite items are not necessarily rare
1369475 forever vinyl gets more than twenty calls a day for customers looking for appraisals for estates and charity donations
1369476 as far as the elements of an appraisal it depends on the needs of the customer for donations we draw a number of different elements to get the correct market value for your collection we neither under nor over appraise your collection
1369477 what makes a house value location location location when it comes to records demand demand demand age is not a determining factor in record collection demand is
1369478 there really arent any obstacles per say other then finding a non profit entity to accept them the irs is very picky about fair retail market value as they should be we should all pay our fair share of the tax burden its important to understand that the irs considers the value of a collection to be based on the value and use of the entity you are donating the collection to if you donate the collection to a university and they hold on to it for three years possibly put it in their library and make the collection available to the students to learn from the appraisal will normally stand if you donate the collection to a thrift shop the irs will normally look at what the thrift shop sold the collection for and adjust any appraisal value over that amount needless to say we highly recommend finding a charity that would value and use the collection rather then just dump the collection for pennies on the dollar
1369479 as you know many records are now valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars because of the amount of appraisals that are requested per day we ve instituted a reasonable fee to cover our cost time and expertise for these appraisals our current fee is 20 00 for the first item of the appraisal and 5 00 for each additional item for collections with over 200 pieces please call us 732 505 5337 for adjusted rates
1369480 all information must contain the following information artist title type of item condition 1 10 is fine with 10 looking like its brand new label and label number if the item is a 45 single does it have a picture sleeve also any other comments you d like to make about the item examples could be if it s a promotional or not for sale copy if it s a test pressing or acetate if it s autographed and so forth if necessary we can and will travel to your location for those of you with larger collections we do work on a rate of 200 00 an hour plus travel food and lodging expenses if you need us to come to you this is only by appointment many of our customers have used this service we also can accept items shipped to us for appraisal feel free to contact us for more information wed loved to help your put a value on your collection

1369509 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1369510 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1369511 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1369512 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1369513 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1369514 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1369515 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1369516 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1369517 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike

1369521 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1369522 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1369523 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1369524 no one takes any notice when i say that its to do with my hormones
1369525 we are proud of the science but the best thing is seeing the great improvement in our patients quality of life
1369526 one woman who had been a nurse developed schizophrenia soon after she had a baby and had the worst form of the illness for eight years she was more in hospital than out she made a dramatic improvement on estrogen and went from being unable to even attend to her personal hygiene constant auditory hallucinations and paranoia to now being able to work as a clerical assistant and live independently
1369527 estrogen is very interesting besides its actions as a sex hormone it plays many roles in the brain
1369528 we are going to be seeing more of this approach spurred on by the kulkarni studies and other papers
1369529 patients and families should not be rushing to their psychiatrists and asking for estrogen patches
1369530 but they should watch the news coming out of this work carefully
1369531 psychological you end up worrying more you should probably stop worrying if youre healthy over 75 go live your life and stop being so anxious about getting everything
1369532 if youre a healthy man and have no symptoms and are over 75 theres no good reason to be screened the important thing is being healthy you dont have symptoms your doctor didnt detect anything on an exam
1369533 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease

1369541 i love making period films because they enable me to create magic on screen it is the idea of being possessed by a particular period through its imagination

1369578 and i am here to tell you beloved ones that never has there been such outpouring of compassion on planet earth as has been created and co created and shared by all of you it began building this great increase with that which you call the date of 9 11 and the event that happened there
1369579 it was further strengthened and empowered by the various events you call katrina you call the tsunami the earthquakes and even some of the brutalities that are so senseless whether they are directed at humans or animals or even the forests the trees and the plant kingdoms and the mineral kingdoms which have been sometimes taken so harshly and with such greed which is found among some of the humans from mother earth
1369580 but it is the human compassion it is that the humans joining together in spirit which you might call the measurement of compassion or the compassion quotient has never been as high as it is now
1369581 but they are also the energies enabling the love to be felt
1369582 and having come together in compassion no one ever really falls back asleep they may take what you call some time out but then in turn they simply remember the event that aroused the compassion in them
1369583 and so it is beloved beautiful ones all that you do to help another is compassion in action
1369584 so as you welcome in love as you breathe this new air of freedom that you have created for yourselves let compassion be your guide to all that you send out and to all that you give within
1369585 and so it is thank you beloved ones for inviting me here and for allowing me to share that which you might call ancient wisdom that is so appropriate for you the compassionate peace makers light workers of the world and so it is namaste
1369586 you are angry arent you you are in pain right
1369587 its not in the table it is you who is angry and yes i understand your emotion
1369588 i now experience this emotion in the full awareness that i choose to do so
1369589 okay i can see why and i forgive you perhaps when you feel my love and support more clearly you will not feel inclined to take that response next time

1369686 use video in pdfs to demonstrate the use of our gages and assembly procedures of our gages
1369687 for one i could think of assembly instructions for the manufacturing plant or even the end customer these of course could be animations created in solidworks or some other program or raw video shot by corporate currently work at a place that designs car shredder plants these are huge complicated plant installations and no doubt plant layouts with general assembly videos and installation videos would be a huge benefit
1369688 i would use it to interact in 3d with everyone customers our machine shop downstairs everyone needs 3d

1369691 i would use it to compilate a movie with the family members that have passed away and distribute it to the cousins
1369692 i would use this program to make interactive displays i would love to import pictures and images to our presentations

1369696 with video we could have fantastic presentations that would help make our products even that much more understandable most important when youre dealing with a manufacturer that doesnt speak your language well it would also be a fantastic sales tool when we launch a new product
1369697 the capabilities of edrawings into a pdf file now this was quite a few years ago now it is amazing how these little items come true i also would like to get more paperless and one of the items that i look forward to is the paperless assembly document that is a movie or animation this capability in a pdf file is just the item that i am looking forward to
1369698 i would use it to circulate videos of drunken caroling from last years christmas party
1369699 wow video in a pdf would be a great way to show assembly details in instruction manuals ive developed several installation manuals for custom automotive products and its difficult to clearly show installation details with only pictures and text descriptions video clips would enable actually demonstrating the operation rather than just describing it

1369701 i would use the 3d and animation capablities to convey our designs quickly to our clients we could quickly show why a part needs to be molded a particular way

1369727 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1369728 but he not only lived through it but by his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1369729 he is a great citizen of russia and my favorite writer
1369730 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1369731 people with his understanding of life were our last hope
1369732 today young children are growing up and they dont know anything
1369733 this will cause enormous delays and as piasa we believe the decision should be a one step process based on science
1369734 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1369735 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1369736 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1369737 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1369738 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1369739 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1369740 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1369741 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1369742 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1369743 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1369744 marlee matlin certainly has taken what some might perceive as a disability and has spoken volumes with her courage and tenacity

1369749 this will put thousands more jobs at risk as companies already facing massive increases in the cost of fuel and interest rates try to balance their books by retrenching workers or may be forced to close down
1369750 teachers suffer as a result of increased prices like all other workers we are a part of cosatu and fully in support of the action led by the federation

1369752 the biggest strike that the city has seen in the last few years
1369753 such emails are malicious hoaxes circulated by the enemies of the trade union movement in an attempt to discredit us
1369754 the site of this mining right is along the wild coast one of the worlds most important biodiversity hotspots
1369755 it is therefore important that the minister of environmental affairs and tourism makes use of provisions under the integrated coastal management bill to prohibit the granting of any more rights along this area of coastline
1369756 the coastal bill is due to be passed by the ncop national council of provinces in the next month which will conclude its passage through parliament
1369757 in uno scenario caratterizzato da sovrabbondanza di messaggi frammentazione delle audience e pubblico sempre pi distratto vogliamo accendere nel consumatore la scintilla dellazione attraverso una comunicazione pi rispettosa della sua centralit del suo tempo e dei suoi spazi e che gli d la possibilit di essere protagonista del dialogo
1369758 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1369759 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1369760 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1369761 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1369762 this collaboration lays out specific practices that all phrs and related services can use whether they are covered by federal privacy rules or not so they can enhance public trust
1369763 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
1369764 that way a student would have saved money and time by not travelling all the way from kunduz or takhar to kabul to buy a book
1369765 there was a big rush and enthusiasm but i had to drop the project for i did not receive support from the government and the ngos of course business was and is part of my agenda but people would have benefitted more from it
1369766 through books our kids would know about their culture history and understand the world books are like seas you have to dive into the sea to get the pearl you have to read books to know how to solve your countrys problems
1369767 unless we reintroduce the habit of book reading we will have more illiterates and more trouble

1369769 silly little nothings things you are ashamed of minding one scrap
1369770 the only real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes
1369771 we are not always sure that god likes them very much we are not sure whether bodies are good or bad it follows that we are not sure whether sex is good or bad
1369772 but find upon getting married that we cannot just flip a switch now that sex is licit sanctioned even blessed by our community we are stuck with years of work and sometimes therapy to unlearn a gnostic anxiety about sex to learn instead that sex is good
1369773 i find i still have to do battle with my expectation formed through years of premarital sex that sex is always supposed to be exciting
1369774 i believe that unlearning this lesson and learning that fidelity and habit are erotic and sexy will take some time
1369775 it should at times feel awkward it should be an act we engage in for comfort it should also be allowed to hold any number of anxieties the sorts of anxieties for instance we might feel about our childs progress in school or our ability to provide sustenance for our family sex becomes another way for two people to realistically engage the strengths and foibles of each other
1369776 if we believe that sex forms us then it goes without saying that it is public business because how we build the persons we are persons who are social and communal and political and economic beings is itself a matter of social concern
1369777 only god can put scripture inside but reading sacred text can put it on your hearts and when your hearts break the holy words will fall inside

1369787 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1369788 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1369789 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1369790 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1369794 since i was a child i wanted to make an object as something tangible to which people can relate and use painting as a space for depicting those objects
1369795 its about time we are able to adequately exhibit art on line the basic jpg is not a great representation of a painting weve worked long and hard to find a suitable technology to properly present paintings and we believe weve found the perfect answer
1369796 it is important that jpgs are able to be represented in a manner and fashion that allows users to inspect the work at close range and at multiple angles it is also extremely important that the user experience appears seamless that the work can be viewed through a standard browser utilizing commonplace technologies weve been able to achieve both objectives no extraordinary applications or downloads are required just the standard flash enabled browser which is basically any and all of them
1369797 but the technology is only a platform to represent the content
1369798 gerstein is one of those artists whose works can be found adorning the walls of a fictional character in a stephen king novel the homes of hollywood celebrities as well as be discussed and debated by all ilk of art critics its a great solo exhibition to highlight a 21st century artist in a 21st century form

1369800 we originally wrote it three years ago looking around us and the people we knew we felt hope for change was fading obamas message perfectly mirrors our lyrics

1369965 it is one of the great ironies of modern times that with all of our time saving creations people have less time to themselves than ever before life in the middle ages is usually portrayed as bleak and dreary but one commodity people had more of than their successors was leisure time until the industrial revolution in fact most evidence suggests that people showed little inclination to work in europe through the middle ages the average number of holidays per year was around 115 days it is interesting to note that still today poorer countries take more holidays on the average than richer ones

1369970 i got some cards we all sat around a table i played the host joey and his wife and a friend of mine were the contestants and we got a trivial pursuit game so we could have questions and played the game for hours and hours and hours
1369971 joeys one of my best friends that helped me hone my hosting skills so once i came back here and started actually working on the show i really had the flow of it but it was much harder than i ever thought it would be
1369972 it wasnt something i ever thought i should pay attention to this but in my career ive always felt i wanted to do many different things being an actor and singer and dancer stage performer television movies now directing and producing ive always felt i wanted to put my hand in every aspect i want to know hey can i do that lets try it why not whats the worst that can happen if i dont succeed ok i dont succeed im not the kind of person who feels he has to be successful at everything i work hard at it but if i dont make it i dont so i dont go in with that pressure
1369973 one of the theories my dad shared with me as a kid theres two ways to think about life you can work really really hard in your youth to make sure that when youre older you dont have to work hard and you wont really enjoy your youth as much but youll have a much better life when youre older or you can enjoy your life young and roll the dice when youre older and know you had a great time i went with the latter
1369974 i probably would be much more successful and have a lot more money if i went with the first one but i feel like im the luckiest person on the planet because i get to do all the things i love to do and i get paid for it

1369977 maybe four months after her birth i said this is enough for me i was in the process of trying to race with

1369997 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1369998 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1369999 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
