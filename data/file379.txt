3790213 we chose to partner with skypower because of their extensive experience in wind development with first nations
3790214 moreover the willow cree wind project will generate a reliable source of local benefits including job training programs employment for the local community and have a positive impact on local tourism
3790215 since no one can live totally pollution free purchasing carbon offsets is a way for people and businesses to really contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally
3790216 the need to build additional transmission provides the opportunity to invest in a long term transmission solution that will facilitate development of additional generation including renewables and support the reliable transport of electricity to fuel future economic growth
3790217 for example more than 3 000 mw of wind power has been proposed in central indiana but additional transmission is necessary to bring it online
3790218 the decision is consistent with fercs direction to invest in the nations electric transmission system to improve reliability and encourage open access to the grid
3790219 given our strong wind profile in minnesota and iowa this decision further encourages development of renewable electricity sources in the itc midwest service area
3790220 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3790221 me vas a ba ar en esa olla de la cacha
3790222 pobrecito nunca vio una palangana enlozada cree que es una olla
3790223 ha detto che c il rischio che subito dopo i giochi un milione di cinesi si stabiliscano in tibet per diluirne ulteriormente la popolazione
3790224 una de las cosas m s importantes es respetar la individualidad y no ser fan tico la homeopat a lleva a que el profesional acompa e al paciente y que ste a su vez se responsabilice y se comprometa con su tratamiento mucha gente tiene la idea de que la medicaci n homeop tica es lenta y no es as cuando se elige bien el remedio
3790225 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3790226 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3790227 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3790228 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3790229 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3790230 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3790231 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3790232 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3790233 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3790234 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3790235 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3790236 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3790237 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3790238 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3790239 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3790240 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3790241 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3790242 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3790243 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3790244 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3790245 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3790246 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3790247 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3790248 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban

3790532 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3790533 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3790534 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded

3790549 my point is simple is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state stay away from issues of personal liberty except to remove old laws that restrict these liberties
3790550 as a lifelong republican i believe in personal responsibility choosing to gamble on the internet should be a personal choice not a decision the government makes for us in 2004 the party platform took the position that government should ban internet gambling i enjoy playing poker on the internet and if the party platform were to advocate banning internet gambling this election season i would seriously consider voting for obama
3790551 i am a long time supporter of conservative views i support the right of mature adult citizens to continue my freedoms to exercise free choice in how i spend my time and recreational moneys sic i support the right to participate in and play poker i object to the reduction in my personal freedoms so someone can push his her morale agenda my country asked me to participate in the struggle to protect our freedoms so i became a part of the military service and fought in viet nam and was honorably discharged why are the few pushing so hard to reduce the freedoms of so many adults who want to play poker
3790552 i have been a reagan republican since 1980 because i believed in the platform of the republican party however the party of ronald reagan is no longer the party that i believe in for the following reason let me say first i believe in family values protecting the unborn religious freedom etc however i have been quite unhappy with the republican party since the passage of uigea in 2006 it is another infringement upon our personal freedoms which we have enjoyed for 200 plus years
3790553 i have never been a single issue voter but if the republican party continues its opposition to the regulation of online gambling i will vote for someone other than senator mccain clearly regulation and taxation is the correct position on this issue

3790558 i and i am still waiting for my allegations to be investigated i am very angry about the whole experience
3790559 we are disappointed to learn that this was not in fact the case and that mr lawson was not satisfied with the outcome of his complaint

3790561 with fuel prices and labor costs skyrocketing industry professionals are looking to streamline their businesses dealerships have a difficult time hiring new technicians keeping up with various brands and improving shop efficiencies landscape tree care and golf course organizations need to minimize fuel costs maximize productivity and decrease downtime the attn system addresses all of these concerns and provides proven unbiased information on repair techniques and diagnostics
3790562 fuel costs are draining profits from companies which are averaging nearly 4 00 per gallon we want to provide information such as properly testing compression on a commercial lawnmower engine or detecting a low compression situation and then repairing it this method can decrease fuel consumption by up to 20 percent so in a typical 40 hour workweek by not addressing the problem this can add more than 40 00 mower week to their fuel expenditures also by implementing the attn preventative maintenance program alone this will help reduce downtime and increase productivity here is an example if a mower belt breaks something that could have been prevented with routine inspection the crew member has to stop working this costs the owner the price of the belt and more than 100 per hour in lost revenues and downtime companies often overlook these happenings until profitability drops dramatically especially for those who operate multiple crews our goal is to partner with our members to minimize or eliminate these occurrences

3790583 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3790584 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3790585 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3790586 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3790624 in light of the current market conditions we intend to reduce the running rate of our overhead costs by 10pc by the end of this financial year
3790625 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity

3790633 our members are facing the reality of a 5 inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
3790634 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3790640 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3790641 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3790642 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3790643 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3790644 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3790645 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3790646 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3790647 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3790648 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3790649 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3790650 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3790651 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
3790652 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
3790653 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency
3790654 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3790655 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3790656 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3790657 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3790658 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3790659 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3790660 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3790661 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3790662 two years ago we decided to change it to a luau format we tried to make it something that is more appealing to the community
3790663 its a good chance for the public to get to know who their firefighters are
3790664 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3790665 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3790666 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3790667 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3790668 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3790669 we anticipate a substantial shipping cost reduction reduced personnel costs and the ability to serve our growing distribution channel with improved accuracy timeliness and flexibility
3790670 and thus its perfect mental training for envisioning the actual olympic hall
3790671 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3790672 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3790676 um bocado tenso no passo alongado e cometeu alguns erros noutros exerc cios

3790678 gostava de ver mais apoios de portugal para desenvolver a disciplina
3790679 nas duas temporadas passadas joguei as competi es como se fossem as ltimas n o estou a ficar mais jovem e este pode ser o meu ltimo ano nos relvados
3790680 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3790681 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3790682 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3790683 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3790684 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3790685 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3790686 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3790687 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3790688 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3790689 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers

3790707 at one point i thought i wasnt going to play again
3790708 i decided that after the way things went in the playoffs that i wasnt ready to quit
3790709 people say oh youre old you cant play anymore but i truly believe it was kind of a fluke season
3790710 everybody has a year once and a while with injuries im close to being 100 percent and really feel good coming in this year and having a good season
3790711 this signature on each soul may be a product of heredity and environment but that only means that heredity and environment are among the instruments whereby god creates a soul i am considering not how but why he makes each soul unique if he had no use for all these differences i do not see why he should have created more souls than one be sure that the ins and outs of your individuality are no mystery to him and one day they will no longer be a mystery to you the mould in which a key is made would be strange thing if you had never seen a key and the key itself a strange thing if you had never seen a lock your soul has a curious shape because it is a hollow made to fit a particular swelling in the infinite contours of the divine substance or a key to unlock one of the doors in the house with many mansions for it is not humanity in the abstract that is to be saved but you you the individual reader john stubbs or janet smith your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone because you were made for it made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand
3790712 we have played well throughout the competition but we were tired today and we struggled because it was hot and the pitch was bad which favoured cameroon
3790713 we tried to play but we didnt take any risks in the final minutes after all we have played three games in six days
3790714 they had a man sent off which made things easier but in the end we were happy to draw because that meant first place i know it wasnt a pretty game
3790715 adebayor is not only promoting our country across the world with his performance for arsenal but by this act in this pressing time he has shown that he is a true son of togo
3790716 the flood disaster is becoming more complex and assuming alarming proportions
3790717 this is not something that concerns me this is the business of the sports director
3790718 borrowers should consider the overall combination of headline rate fee and the lenders svr standard variable rate
3790719 personal loan rates can be much lower than store cards and with the regular fixed repayments the loan is split into more manageable chunks which is easier for borrowers to pay back
3790720 it is also worth noting that there will be a time when fixed rates are the right product for most of the market
3790721 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals
3790722 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalize on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3790723 lonmin has an extensive program of operational improvement that is being implemented by the new and experienced operational mining management team
3790724 xstrata is seeking to capture these benefits which would otherwise accrue to lonmins shareholders
3790725 those who worked collaboratively with the mayors office to arrive at a balanced budget could expect to have their priorities honored
3790726 its a very aggressive and obviously retaliatory move but were not just going to roll over
3790727 imagine youre a working person and all of a sudden your salary gets slashed people can lose their homes just because the mayor wants to retaliate it remains to be seen how well fight back but were certainly not going to watch our members lose their homes
3790728 since the recent string of robberies business has ducked down a little
3790729 we appreciate all their efforts and hope it makes a difference
3790730 wed like everybody to be safe and secure the angels are a bonus to our efforts they can serve as our eyes and ears and also be a deterrent to anybody in these neighborhoods thinking of engaging in criminal activity
3790731 we plan to be in the area two to three months or until we get these knuckleheads off the street
3790732 i think wed be better off with a safety ambassador program people with safety vests and flashlights and a means of communicating with the police department
3790733 last time they came they were here for their photo op and then they left

3790740 the injuries the girls suffered could not be caused by hits with stones and kicks they died hit by a car
3790741 like us real madrid arent yet at the top of their game
3790742 theyre not even a month through their pre season yet so its going to be an evenly matched game
3790743 physically the teams are going to have their hands full this sunday
3790744 im glad that i played in the mestalla its the first time ive done so in a valencia shirt although i did it with getafe
3790745 it was an important win 3 1 ahead of the super cup
3790746 im happy to have fulfilled my dream and now i hope to continue working every day in order to play many matches here
3790747 he might have scored twice against vitesse but he didnt have to do that as we knew his quality already
3790748 like david vila and joaqu n s nchez these players would be key for any club and we need to keep them here in order to fight for titles
3790749 i think were still learning and i think were getting better as we go on
3790750 i wish we had a little bit more international experience than we do probably but i still think we have a lot of talented guys and i think that a lot of guys on this team will be competing for spots on the world cup thats good for u s soccer this experience will help us in the future
3790751 these tournaments are such a fine line between in and out
3790752 you walk that line and it goes one way or the other and sometimes you just need a call here or a call there to sort of push you in the right direction we missed that today
3790753 no one gave us a chance in the beginning saying we werent going to advance
3790754 we improved each game and the bond and the chemistry we developed as players in such a short amount of time is something special i dont think a lot of teams have that and thats why we were able to fight like it was our last game unfortunately we came a bit short
3790755 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3790756 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3790757 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3790758 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3790759 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3790760 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3790761 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3790762 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3790763 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3790764 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3790765 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
3790766 until recently there were only limited software tools and scientific workflows available to help us automatically produce high quality data sets surrounding each of abcams thousands of antibody targets we need these data sets to help our customers find the right products
3790767 we were looking for solutions for supporting our team of experts and were impressed by the advanced technologies of transinsight the fact that the company operates the semantic search engine gopubmed org and has extensive bioinformatics and protein databases expertise made the decision to work with transinsight easy
3790768 it is good to see how we can significantly enhance our customers performance by improving their data quality and thus freeing their staff from an unnecessary burden

3790774 canada olympic house is meant to be a haven for our athletes their families and their friends a place where they can chill out and relax
3790775 so remember whatever decisions you make on your shift the athletes comfort is our main priority
3790776 do you have any idea how long ive been trying to get here
3790777 okay sir can you just forget what your mother told you and give me a nice slouch
3790778 hey folks somebody here just broke the camera with his smile were going to need a few minutes to fix it so please no more ugly smiles okay
3790779 why dont you go inside into the air conditioning for a while
3790780 well yesterday we flew to xian saw the terre cotta warriors had a tour of the city then flew back to beijing today we were up early and visited the great wall
3790781 i cant do sex but i can give you a stickjob
3790782 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3790783 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3790784 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3790785 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3790786 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland
3790787 theres opportunity in the space between web apis and raw cloud computing
3790788 soon all youre going to need is a terminal and net connection but until then there are opportunities to build up file systems system admin services and other things we can do with web apis
3790789 for this new audience we needed to keep it simple
3790790 for a higher end audience you may throw all the bells and whistles at it but we really had to think about what these people were going to use
3790791 we found that with this audience and specifically with women its a lot about balance
3790792 its become somewhat impossible for companies to ignore that women use technology but a lot of whats out there seems fairly superficial in that things have been made pink
3790793 like apple realized something thats easy to use and good to look at is something thats going to appeal to men as well the whole assumption is that you have to dumb things down for women but men dont have some gene that makes technology easier for them
3790794 ten years ago you may have had one cell phone in your home for emergency purposes
3790795 today you may have four cell phones in your home the same thing is happening with digital cameras and other portable devices such as mp3 players laptops and so forth so as the number of products in a home has increased it has spurred greater interest in design its not just a functional device that everyone in the home shares you carry it with you wherever you go it is a reflection of your personality and style
3790796 our audience has expanded from predominantly male to much more varied end users
3790797 pretty much like a cell phone a mobile pc is becoming part of your everyday life and not only do oems want to differentiate themselves by design but end users also want to differentiate themselves by buying something that is more design oriented color form feels different or even behaves different
3790798 its more portable than a traditional notebook because we wanted it to fit in a handbag not just a backpack
3790799 we wanted to make it very colorful and stylish so we used colors such as red and gold which we had never done before and we designed the unit with a very strong entertainment focus on it because we believe that a female audience would use their pc for both work and play
3790800 one of our studies of females told us that keyboards and long fingernails dont go very well together a ladys fingernails would get stuck
3790801 so we went with the separated keyboard because it would reduce the amount of mistyping
3790802 anybody and everybody can benefit from that its something well be expanding across our product lines and will serve as a visual differentiator and unification of the vaio product line
3790803 we found that when you ask men and women what are some of the variables they consider when evaluating a product for purchase things such as color and appearance are pretty far down the list
3790804 you have to satisfy the basic needs first then you see elements such as color appear
3790805 it used to be women had to claim im a woman and i can do this and try to be proud to be a woman but weve kind of transcended that
3790806 we design phones based on how people relate to mobile phones
3790807 our marketing manager mentioned that many women use n series because it makes them look smarter compared to using some girlie phone
3790808 you cant really generalize what women want because you always have to consider the trade offs if i do need and like the functions i will probably overlook the size issues choosing a phone is a lot like choosing a boyfriend you cannot look at just one aspect of the product he may be handsome but he may have a personality problem a mobile phone is something that you wake up with and go to sleep with
3790809 a torch light can be used in many other contexts like a parking lot or somewhere thats particularly dark

3790817 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3790818 youre right i dont but i have a vagina and it says i will
3790819 oh yeah last night your house your mom asked me to give you a hug i think this looks like a good time to pass it along
3790820 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids
3790821 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3790822 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3790823 in his work the artist should be like god in creation invisible and all powerful he should be felt everywhere and seen nowhere
3790824 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians
3790825 like our counterparts across the country our newsrooms are facing tough financial times with cuts in staff and news coverage one goal of our new guild unit is to work creatively with our managers and the broader community to sustain the quality of newspapers and web sites
3790826 nach einem scheitern von frau ypsilanti stellen sich viele optionen neu
3790827 das scheitern von frau ypsilanti ist die voraussetzung f r neue konstellationen frau ypsilanti hat sich in eine sackgasse man vriert aus der es keinen zweiten ausgang mehr gibt
3790828 nach dem tag einer niederlage von andrea ypsilanti ffnet sich ein zeitlich berschaubarer korridor in dem nochmal alle varianten die man im hessischen landtag denken kann auf dem pr fstand stehen werden es gibt keinen automatismus wonach auf das scheitern von frau ypsilanti neuwahlen folgen w rden diesen automatismus stellt nur sie her um in den eigenen reihen die angst vor neuwahlen zu erh hen

3790846 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
3790847 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3790848 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
3790849 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3790850 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be

3790862 the latest developments in hr management are about changing the way hr managers think and the questions they ask
3790863 it also is changing the way they gather process and most importantly evaluate information these developments hold the promise of helping the profession move beyond chasing fads to getting to the real work of helping their organizations improve business results through more effective management of people
3790864 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
3790865 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards
3790866 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
3790867 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3790868 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3790869 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3790870 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3790871 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3790872 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3790873 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3790874 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3790875 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3790876 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3790877 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3790878 model city buildings and projects by paul rudolph for new haven and yale

3790881 smoothed analysis of algorithms why the simplex algorithm usually takes polynomial time
3790882 we had that support from everyone we went out there and showed what we could do today my day didnt go as well as id hoped but i was focused i stayed on and i fought as hard as i could i believe i left it all out there heart and soul
3790883 the whole way through we focused on one event at a time one routine at a time
3790884 its just unbelievable considering everything weve been through its been a roller coaster ride i couldnt be prouder of these guys of all the coaches and this whole collective collaborative effort
3790885 producers who come to ag progress days have an opportunity to see a wide variety of equipment and products anything from machinery and dairy equipment to animal housing feed seed and fertilizer
3790886 they also can talk to representatives of lenders insurance firms crop consultants and other business services
3790887 it really is one stop shopping which can save farmers a lot of the time and gas that they otherwise would have to burn traveling to different vendors to comparison shop
3790888 in one day they can evaluate models and brands that might not be readily available in their home area
3790889 the linux foundation hears from developers all over the world who want to participate in the kernel community but sometimes struggle with exactly how
3790890 this new guide will make that process easier and bring new companies and developers into the linux fold we are extremely proud of the work jon corbet has done here and feel it will make a lasting improvement to the linux community
3790891 while the linux kernel development process is quite open it can sometimes be surprising or intimidating to new developers this guide should help aspiring kernel developers and their managers understand how kernel development works how to avoid common pitfalls and how to join our community in making the kernel better for everybody
3790892 linux kernel development how fast is it going who is doing it and who is sponsoring it

3790894 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3790895 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3790896 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3790897 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3790898 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3790899 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3790900 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3790901 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3790902 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3790903 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3790904 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3790905 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3790906 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3790907 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3790908 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3790909 what participation i have had no participation in boldrin and levines book whatsoever
3790910 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3790911 really can you point me to a time where larry lessig published a piece arguing an issue related to a case he was involved in where he does not mention his involvement
3790912 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3790913 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3790914 mike well not really is from mls who apparently has the temperament and debating skills of an 8 year old when its been shown that hes been wrong

3790943 it is difficult to believe that the board would recommend a sale under 140 crowns
3790944 in the market it is easy to argue for fair value of 130 140 crowns and given the way the company has been performing lately this would be more correct than the share price today
3790945 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3790946 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3790947 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3790948 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3790949 theyll continue to pop up because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3790950 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3790951 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3790952 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3790991 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
3790992 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
3790993 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
3790994 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3790995 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3790996 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3790997 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3790998 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3790999 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3791000 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon
3791001 an acquisition of the company is the most likely outcome

3791026 hes a smart football player hes very instinctive he picks things up fast hes a guy that simulates warrick dunn when warrick isnt being featured on the practice field he should have been drafted it was a mistake we made here in tampa but we got him
3791027 when i didnt get a phone call i stayed in bed for about three days
3791028 bottom line this is the bush administration shoving science aside to serve its special interest supporters
3791029 the bush administration released a weak owl recovery plan in may that was roundly criticized by independent scientists and now it is using that inadequate plan as justification to remove habitat protections
3791030 protecting critical habitat for spotted owls is essential to their recovery over the long term but it also helps to protect forest ecosystems and the web of life that depends on them
3791031 salmon and myriad other fish and wildlife depend on forest protections already in place in the northwest
3791032 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3791033 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
3791034 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3791035 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3791036 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3791037 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3791038 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3791039 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3791040 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
3791041 to suggest that our nations most important wildlife law could be gutted after a mere 60 day written comment period is the height of arrogance and disrespect for wildlife science elected officials have been saying no to proposals like this for 15 years
3791042 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
3791043 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
3791044 with these changes the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
3791045 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
3791046 this could mean death by a thousand cuts for many threatened and endangered species
3791047 the creation of an arbitrary deadline could enable even the most harmful projects to escape endangered species act scrutiny
3791048 the bush administration has a long history of downplaying the role of science in its decisions
3791049 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees
3791050 they have defied the orders to vacate so we have decided to enforce the law and drive them out and if they resist to neutralise them
3791051 their lives are already at a standstill classes have been suspended livelihoods abandoned and their lives in danger
3791052 this is the first time in years weve had a big evacuation you can see that even the farm animals have been evacuated and we dont know where to put them
3791053 its frightening and sooner or later the bullets will hit those trying to escape
3791054 we had to leave we couldnt stay in our house but i dont think it is safe where were now staying
3791055 they are adaptable and can quickly make low carbon lifestyles and career choices a part of their daily lives youth should therefore be given a chance to take an active part in the decision making of local national and global levels and they can actively support initiatives that will lead to the passage of far reaching legislation
3791056 unless we make radical changes in the way we live by the time the youth of 2008 reach my age the world may well have become a rather inhospitable place
3791057 in many developing countries in particular youth especially girls and young women are often responsible for farming finding water and collecting fuel wood these tasks will be rendered more difficult and will take even more time away from education or productive activities as climate change affects the availability of water agricultural productivity and the survival of ecosystems
3791058 a clear case of bad practice and an indicator of bad safety culture
3791059 reason for serious concern regarding the resistance of the reactor building of ol3
3791060 while nuclear power is inherently unsafe the unsound safety culture existing under the french contractor areva and its subcontractors threatens to significantly exacerbate the risks related to this nuclear power plant this is not a cookie factory building a nuclear installation demands the upmost caution neglect of safety standards can be disastrous
3791061 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3791062 the chinese government is actively waging an olympics propaganda campaign to showcase tibet as legitimately theirs and tibetans as happy under chinese rule but the reality is much different
3791063 while tibetan song and dance is on display in beijing in tibet our culture is under siege and our people are being forcibly kept from speaking out about their repression at the hands of the chinese authorities
3791064 there really is no need to resort to far flung conspiracy theories behind virtually every abortion is an unintended pregnancy and because women of color are much more likely to experience unintended pregnancies than any other group they are also more likely to seek and obtain abortions than any other group
3791065 fundamentally the question policymakers should be asking is not why women of color have high abortion rates but rather what can be done to help them have fewer unintended pregnancies and achieve better health outcomes more generally
3791066 minority women are among the most likely to experience frequent life changes and to be dissatisfied with their contraceptive method
3791067 either of these factors can result in womens skipping pills or not using a condom every time some women are also dissatisfied with their provider a problem often made worse by cultural or linguistic barriers that can lead to frustration and poor follow through on contraceptive use
3791068 antiabortion activists in minority communities who are trying to protect african american women and latinas from themselves by restricting access to safe and legal abortion have it backward they should instead focus their efforts on reducing the disparities in access to quality health care and in health outcomes more broadly and if they are most concerned about the disproportionately high abortion rates they should begin by advocating for improved access to high quality contraceptive services to reduce the disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy in these communities
3791069 unfortunately this may not be the end i understand there are more possibilities of similar announcements as some ig and other investigations are wrapping up we will deal with them as they come
3791070 during the bush administration the priorities and the personnel of oil companies and the federal regulators have been indistinguishable and interchangeable
3791071 especially during the bush second term the revolving door at the top echelons of mms has spun like a windmill
3791072 post employment prohibitions do not prevent officials from subverting the public interest to enhance their own future private employment prospects
3791073 this period at mms has been a modern day teapot dome scandal but on an epic scale as measured by the jaw dropping give away of public resources
3791074 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories it is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated it means that a huge amount of animal suffering is simply being ignored and efforts to replace animal research with more modern techniques are being hampered vivisection is considered one of the most controversial uses of animals so its about time that governments around the world including our own brought the truth into the open
3791075 for the first time we can start to piece together a global picture of animal experimentation
3791076 and the scale of animal suffering is truly staggering with so much known about the remarkable sentiency of non human primates the fact that we subject nearly 90 000 monkeys to experiments every year is a devastating statistic
3791077 the chinese government should immediately release ji sizun and anyone else detained by police while trying to exercise their basic rights
3791078 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
3791079 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
3791080 nobody should confuse the lack of protesters with a lack of complaints
3791081 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views
3791082 the international olympic committee and world leaders who honored beijing by attending the opening ceremonies shouldnt play deaf dumb and blind while people are hauled off for peaceful criticism
3791083 china is suppressing free expression despite its olympic pledge not to do so and the question is whether the rest of the world silently accepts that

3791104 i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and casey said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me

3791126 ive seen the pictures of the baby she looks like john edwards
3791127 shes got his eyes and jaw line and lips but she does have rielles nose

3791129 ive seen the pictures of the baby she looks like john edwards shes got his eyes and jaw line and lips but she does have rielles nose
3791130 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3791131 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3791132 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3791133 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3791134 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3791135 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3791136 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3791137 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3791138 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution

3791149 this image shows the various steps and elements used in a tutorial
3791150 it is not untrue to say flights are usually more expensive from an online travel agent that has screen scraped ryanair fares we have no issue with that but lets say it how it is ryanair is forcing consumers to go to its website because it wants to sell a whole plethora of products from there flights are the hook
3791151 we know from our own price comparative work that ryanair is not always the cheapest for hotels car hire and travel insurance products so consumers should shop around for the best deal if buying such products online
3791152 theres no point in doing this for third party sites we wouldnt promote bringing a visitor to our site and pushing them to another one where the sale is made we would go out of business very quickly if we did that the whole reason for a travel agents existence is to resell
3791153 you have to ask yourself why no other airline has a problem with screen scraping in fact a lot will negotiate lower prices with online agents because they value the business they create for the airlines and they want to incentivise us to sell more

3791188 youre a pregnant teenager dad you just said youre a pregnant teenager
3791189 hey clay why are you laughing do you think it would be fun to be a teenager who is pregnant
3791190 doesnt god want us to wait until after were married for that s e x stuff
3791191 how much money do you think it takes to feed a baby
3791192 how many teenagers work full time jobs that you know of
3791193 do you think a pregnant teenager can afford a new baby
3791194 who do you think watches the baby while the teenager goes to school
3791195 so if it were your sister who had a baby as a teenager that would be me and dad watching the baby while your sister tried to finish her education right
3791196 what if god had plans for you to become a missionary when you grow up and tell everyone about jesus and then you have a baby when you are a teenager so you cant do that because you needed to take care of the baby wouldnt that be sad that you couldnt do the big thing god had planned for you or that you at least had to wait a very long time to do it until that baby was grown

3791203 attorney general rowe has made domestic violence prevention a high priority for his office
3791204 any amendments that shut down independent state inquiries are particularly disturbing especially in light of the fact that twenty two maine residents have filed a complaint asking the puc to investigate whether verizon unlawfully disclosed records of its maine customers
3791205 in maine telephone subscribers have a right to privacy and their records should not be turned over unless the proper legal procedures have been followed the puc is certainly entitled to investigate whether telephone companies have violated the privacy rights of their customers and i urge our senators to reject any fisa amendment that would interfere with the pucs ability to conduct such investigations
3791206 i am gravely concerned about the negative health outcomes that may result from consumers unknowingly mixing dangerously high amounts of caffeine with higher than disclosed amounts of alcohol
3791207 caffeine is a stimulant that can mask feelings of intoxication giving drinkers the false impression that they can drink more and function normally this is a recipe for disaster
3791208 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3791209 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive

3791211 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3791212 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3791213 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3791214 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3791215 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3791216 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3791217 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3791218 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this

3791243 folding home is a distributed computing project people from throughout the world download and run software to band together to make one of the largest supercomputers in the world
3791244 folding home sometimes abbreviated as fah or f h is a distributed computing dc project designed to perform computationally intensive simulations of protein folding and other molecular dynamics md
3791245 i fight cancer on two fronts my business and folding i own a home care business where i send nurses to homes to care for the elderly at their homes one aspect of my business is we take care of chemo therapy patients at home also we take care of their ailments while on chemo in miami my parents own a hospice company where they send nurses to take care of patients on their last months of life those deemed to have less than 6 months to live this is where i get my passion for folding from seeing hearing talking and interacting with people who suffer from all these diseases makes you want to do something about it
3791246 what is the big push for using graphics cards gpus for power processing what ever happened to getting cpus
3791247 a server farm streamlines internal processes by distributing the workload between the individual components of the farm and expedites computing processes by harnessing the power of multiple servers the farms rely on load balancing software that accomplishes such tasks as tracking demand for processing power from different machines prioritizing the tasks and scheduling and rescheduling them depending on priority and demand that users put on the network when one server in the farm fails another can step in as a backup
3791248 holy shi 1 hr 51 min ago 11 12 heaven help the poor dude when his farm goes up in smoke thanks to nvidias recent shoddy hardware quality
3791249 i know baker and ranganathan and their work very well and like the rest of the protein community find their work very important and impressive however rosetta home and folding home are addressing very different problems rosetta only predicts the final folded state not how do proteins fold and rosetta has nothing to do with protein misfolding thus those methods are not useful for the questions were interested in and the diseases were tackling alzheimers disease and other aggregation related diseases also one should note that accurate computational protein structure prediction is still very challenging compared to what one can do experimentally whereas the information obtained from folding home on the nature of folding and misfolding pathways matches experiment eg with quantitative validation in rates free energy etc and then goes beyond what experiment can tell us in that arena while rosetta has gone a long way and is a very impressive project given the choice between a rosetta predicted structure and a crystal structure one would always chose the crystal structure i bet that will be changing due to their great efforts but that may still be a ways off for that dream to be realized so both are valuable projects imho but addressing very different questions i think there are some misunderstandings out there though some people think fah is all about structure prediction which it is not thats rosettas strength and some think rosetta is about misfolding related disease which its not thats folding homes strength hopefully this post helps straighten some of that out
3791250 you know how you see a show car and its really cool and then four years later you see the production car and it sucks and you go what happened they had it they had it in the palm of their hands they grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory
3791251 what happened was the designers came up with this really great idea then they take it to the engineers and the engineers go nah we cant do that thats impossible and so it gets a lot worse then they take it to the manufacturing people and they go we cant build that and it gets a lot worse

3791257 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3791258 the tone is clearly dovish with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so
3791259 against that background we stick to the view that interest rates will eventually fall very sharply once inflation pressures finally recede market rate expectations therefore have scope to fall much further in time

3791266 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
3791267 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
3791268 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3791269 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3791270 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3791271 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3791272 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3791273 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3791274 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon

3791321 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3791322 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3791323 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate

3791342 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
3791343 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
3791344 this removes a key obstacle to future cooperation and the full respect of the rights of palestinian workers decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the palestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice fairness and democratic rights in the building of a palestinian state
3791345 we are very pleased that this agreement has now been reached
3791346 every worker whether of israeli palestinian or other origin must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards the outcome of our dialogue with the pgftu can only help achieve this and help lay the foundations for future cooperation between israeli and palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice peace and prosperity for all in the region

3791403 why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders they do not wash their hands when they eat a meal
3791404 and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition
3791405 any support you might have had from me is dedicated to god
3791406 this is readily suggested by the analogy of physical growth which is such that the parts and proportions of the developed form however altered correspond to those which belong to its rudiments vincentius of lerins adopts this illustration in distinct reference to christian doctrine
3791407 imitate the law of the body which as years go on developes indeed and opens out its due proportions and yet remains identically what it was small are a babys limbs a youths are larger yet they are the same

3791409 the principle prayers and principle works have been taken to be those which by tradition and by their suitability for present day needs seem particularly apt so that not only are faithful helped to make satisfaction for the punishment due their sins but also and above all are encouraged to a greater zeal for the exercise of charity this is the principle upon which the compilation of this work is based
3791410 that split between the faith professed and the daily lives of many by gathering into one vital synthesis all their undertakings in the human domestic professional scholarly or technical sphere with religious values under whose supreme direction all things are harmonized unto gods glory
3791411 rejoice in hope be patient in trials be constant in prayer
3791412 whether then you are eating or drinking or whatever you are doing do all for the glory of god
3791413 with all prayer and supplication pray at every opportunity in the spirit to that end be watchful with all perseverance and supplication for all the holy ones
3791414 and whatever you do kin word or in deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
3791415 tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on peoples shoulders but they will not lift a finger to move them
3791416 es lamentable que tenga que ocurrir una matanza como la de paya para que se compruebe que la lucha contra la criminalidad nunca se ganar en el plano interno con acciones policiales y judiciales mientras la naci n siga siendo bombardeada con drogas por tierra y mar sin que el estado reacciones en rgicamente frente a una agresi n criminal tan peligrosa

3791515 i found out the day after my singles match id lost four and a half kilos since i arrived here
3791516 i was struggling not so much with the heat but i didnt prepare for the matches as well as i should have done after all the flying and stuff
3791517 it was unprofessional and disappointing on my part and again something i need to learn from and make sure it doesnt happen again because i think im playing really well right now the us open is my favourite tournament and i believe i can do really well there
3791518 ideally i would have like to have got here earlier but i didnt because i played very well in cincinnati which was great but normally at each tournament i weigh myself right at the start and i should have checked that as soon as i got here instead of the day after my match
3791519 you make sure you are maintaining your weight not being too dehydrated because there is a lot of humidity here and you are sweating more than normal and make sure you are eating well enough
3791520 we didnt serve particularly well or return well and it was always going to be difficult if you cant put any pressure on them
3791521 we have not played much together and thats something in the future we will look to do before we play in the big tournaments
3791522 after being a part of the olympics for the first time and seeing what it means when the athletes win medals and how big a deal it is you realise how much you want to do well and sometimes you want it a bit too much and dont play so well
3791523 recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership
3791524 this is no surprise at all people believe the company is worth more and that roche can afford to pay more the game of chess has begun

3791539 who choose to abort an unwanted pregnancy may experience feelings of grief and loss but there is no evidence that a single abortion causes significant mental health problems
3791540 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3791541 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3791542 we have sent a report on how easy it is to attack peds back in november 2007 to all concerned parties gchq apacs visa mastercard ingenico and verifone
3791543 we were effectively ignored until just before the report was made public by the bbc in february 2008 then responses included shifting blame and asserting that what we found is not really a problem it was also made clear to us that little is about to happen as a result of our findings peds will not be recalled or de certified from use one frequent response to our findings by apacs is that ped tampering is only possible under lab conditions
3791544 for fraudsters its not a question of whats possible but whats cost effective

3791549 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3791550 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3791551 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3791552 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3791553 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3791554 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3791561 luckily i was next to the world record holder in the preliminary judging off her i think i did pretty good

3791565 lets grow this group to 100 000 in a day and send a clear message to the obama campaign that evan bayh is not the right choice for vice president

3791579 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment
3791580 in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3791581 this is a counsel of despair and ignorance harking back to the tory days of margaret thatcher when norman lamont told people in the north to pack their bags and leave
3791582 we have made vast improvements since then and policy exchange would do better to recognise success rather than to send people down to the overcrowded south east
3791583 whereas some of the ideas such as greater devolution to local authorities and understanding real economic geography are interesting the proposals put forward by policy exchange relating to growth in cambridge lack any real substance or depth
3791584 the focus of growth and regeneration should be on what is right for each individual location not simply giving up on certain towns in the north and moving everyone down to the south
3791585 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3791586 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3791587 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3791588 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3791589 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy
3791590 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk

3791603 qatar airways was formed in 1997 and so much has happened with the airline and the industry since its creation
3791604 we have developed and evolved into an airline of choice but there is no room to rest on our laurels which is why we have to maintain our strong position in the market and project our best attributes to the travelling public
3791605 our new global campaign aims to further strengthen our position as an airline of choice and we are confident viewers and readers will be able to connect with the campaign giving them a feeling of being part of the qatar airways travel experience
3791606 essentially well present to the court what we think would be enough evidence to establish probable cause
3791607 so there has not been a positive identification on her

3791612 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
3791613 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need
3791614 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3791615 they republican lawmakers and president george w bush have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3791616 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3791617 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote
3791618 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3791619 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3791621 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile travelled
3791622 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3791641 senator obama believes that we have to double scientific research funding so that we can take advantage of the enormous talent in the united states and we can regain our global competitive edge
3791642 doubling is a nice fun number for political purposes its clean its smooth but it doesnt reflect a balancing of political priorities there will be competing demands for funds these are scarce taxpayer dollars they come from american families who work hard to generate them and good scientists should make the case for their research money and the senator will be happy to listen to that case and fund appropriately but to promise everybody everything is not really laying it on the line

3791644 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3791645 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3791646 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3791647 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3791648 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3791649 we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise
3791650 it is a game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value
3791651 was able to gain control of the situation without any injuries
3791652 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3791653 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3791654 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3791655 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3791656 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3791657 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3791658 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3791659 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3791660 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3791661 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3791662 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3791663 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3791664 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3791665 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3791666 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3791667 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3791668 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3791669 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3791670 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3791671 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all

3791674 he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe
3791675 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lecter type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with
3791676 it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day

3791681 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3791682 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3791685 de bondsvoorzitter heeft ons gebeld maar ik heb hem gezegd dat wij niet overwegen om rossini naar peking te laten gaan er zijn precedenten die duidelijk maken dat wij hieraan niet moeten meewerken
3791686 rossini zat mentaal aan de grond nadat hij in extremis afviel in de selectie voor peking de club heeft hem er weer bovenop geholpen en hem heel intens de voorbereiding op het nieuwe seizoen laten meebeleven als hij nog moet vertrekken dan was dat allemaal voor niets de speler zelf staat er niet weigerachtig tegenover om hier te blijven
3791687 die doelstelling is bereikt maar dat betekent niet dat het tornooi voorbij is het duel tegen itali is ook maar een wedstrijd die 90 minuten duurt alles kan we moeten hetzelfde doen als in onze vorige drie wedstrijden in een tornooi hangt het vaak af van details we moeten geloven dat we die wedstrijd kunnen winnen nu trekken we naar peking en slapen voor het eerst in het olympisch dorp ik heb er al veel leuks over gehoord
3791688 im talking with the muslim leaders may muslim kagawad kasi kami sa bayan ng aleosan were trying to reach out na sana wag na dumating sa point na yon we have a muslim board member in aleosan we hope a religious war will not happen
3791689 and of course kino contain natin yung anger and hatred ng mga christians dahil nga sila ay nasunugan we are trying to contain the anger and hatred of the christians over what happened to their houses
3791690 side by side christian and muslims naninirahan ng matahimik at mapayapa sa community ngayon pumasok dito yan si umbra kato para whatever magnakaw gumuwa ng mga atrocities kasalanan niya sa bayan yan kung itoy lumago before kato came into the picture the christians and the muslims in the area were co existing peacefully there is no one to blame but him in case a religious war occurs here
3791691 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3791692 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3791693 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda

3791733 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3791734 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3791735 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3791736 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3791737 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3791738 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3791739 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3791767 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3791768 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3791769 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3791770 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3791771 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3791772 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3791774 all of us to some degree live around the truth of the gospel but do not get it so the key to continual and deeper spiritual renewal and revival is the continual re discovery of the gospel a stage of renewal is always the discovery of a new implication or application of the gospel seeing more of its truth

3791793 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3791794 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3791795 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3791796 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3791797 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3791798 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3791799 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3791800 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3791801 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3791802 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3791803 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3791804 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3791805 and were donning our sunglasses dammit who cares if its usually more siberia than sardinia outside
3791806 despite the poor weather and current rocky financial climate our sunglasses are consistently exceeding expectations with our selfridges store trading ten per cent up on last year
3791807 this is partly due to the trend of celebrities wearing frames whatever the weather with sunglasses fast becoming the must have accessory
3791808 the wayfarer is still forging ahead with colourful updates and top frames takes vintage ray bans have the most kudos with competitive sourcing from ebay and vintage stores upping the ante
3791809 it was the first time in british share history that a relationship split was effectively the subject of a stock exchange announcement
3791810 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people

3791826 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3791827 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3791828 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3791829 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute

3791841 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories
3791842 it is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated

3791885 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3791886 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3791887 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3791888 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3791889 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3791890 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3791891 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3791892 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3791893 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3791894 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3791895 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3791896 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3791897 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

3791912 they are both great sides on their day but maybe they dont win enough games when they dont play well
3791913 both are improving though and theyll push us all the way this season
3791914 it did surprise me the way they started was incredible

3791922 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3791923 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3791924 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3791925 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them

3791950 given that worcester ma has about 5 000 more readers than worcester uk it is fairly clear that a vast majority of readers are in fact not seeking the city in worcestershire
3791951 if worcester ma was the capital of the state then i would agree to a move but it is just a city with no special status

3792028 i think hes looking forward to having a big year
3792029 he followed what he did last year with a good spring and hes continued that throughout the summer i think hes excited and were excited for him
3792030 everybody looks up to him always has and i think they always will
3792031 especially this year hes going to be a great leader for the offense and the team altogether
3792032 all three of them want to start thats what you want to see
3792033 i think all three of the guys we bring a different aspect to the game when we put it all together it makes us a very dangerous group

3792035 by the time everything shakes down well probably have two with a third that can do a bunch of different things usually those things work their way out
3792036 rep sali should take public disclosure more seriously and perhaps figure out a way to train his staff on computer use

3792044 but i persuaded them that it was the only way to meet a girl
3792045 i had wanted to meet the man of my dreams but how could i when i was always stuck at home
3792046 many young women are unemployed because their parents are afraid to allow them to leave home
3792047 many men have also been victim of violence that has swept iraq and others have simply left the country
3792048 demand at most divisions remains very strong particularly in the u s
3792049 margin percentages were tempered somewhat by performance at the edwards twister division however we believe recently implemented management and organizational changes will result in improved performance in upcoming quarters backorders at all divisions remain high and we look forward to building on some very positive market fundamentals in the upcoming quarters
3792050 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time

3792053 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personnality

3792061 i was pretty sick to my stomach through most of december
3792062 so i just kind of got away from football for a while just went home and ate some home cooked food
3792063 i couldnt it was very disappointing and embarrassing to end the season like we did
3792064 i watched some of my friends from other schools play in their bowl games
3792065 i didnt have a whole lot to watch i watched a lot of our own tape and a lot of our opponent tape for the upcoming season i think all of us around here knew we could have some challenging moments but with all that said we expected better
3792066 really i dont think theres any one thing to explain it
3792067 maybe later on in my life when i look back on it and have a better perspective ill be able to explain it to myself but theres just so many things that played into it
3792068 you have injuries and some guys dont play as good as they could in some games when you need that performance its really hard to get the win especially when its going to be a tough game anyway you really need everybody playing at their peak performance we didnt have that we didnt have it from myself and some other guys
3792069 it was very hard on a lot of us its disheartening coach prince has spoken about it ive spoken about it

3792140 the investment capital and the strategic alignment of canterra seeds and riverland ag will ensure that the growth of canterra seeds continues
3792141 this strengthening of our balance sheet will allow us to maintain a sharp focus on our core business while creating new business opportunities for both canterra seeds and riverland ag
3792142 this is a good move for the company while giving us a chance to complete the restructuring of the companies goals we will be announcing all of the companys improvements weekly towards the growth of the company and the deals we are working on

3792159 at this point we have an agreement between the three teams that each team is going to host so i think its a good opportunity for everybody to showcase their players and move their camp around a little bit

3792402 the lads i had here at swindon worked hard and got the reward for it
3792403 they were under paid they got extra money which we all know about for winning matches
3792404 im sure any board of directors would rather be going down that road rather than paying them big money for a signing a contract paying them big money for actually doing nothing for the club
3792405 i didnt have that problem with the players i brought in
3792406 they wanted to come and play and if they were successful they accepted hopefully they were going to get rewarded for it
3792407 during my time at swindon they didnt always get rewarded for it until we tried to do something about it and give them extra money for beating teams
3792408 we had to reward them which got us into a little bit of trouble but that is the right way
3792409 i had a great time this was the first club that gave me a managerial opportunity i didnt really know what lay ahead and it was a bit of a roller coaster ride but i enjoyed every minute

3792460 this year we would have had an exciting presence with apb at e3 if we had continued with webzen as our publisher but given that we re acquired the rights to apb just this spring and closed a very large fundraising round 50 000 000 to secure apbs future the timing just wasnt right to attend e3 rtw is very excited with apbs progress and we have used our fundraising as a means to invest even more heavily in the apb development team rtw hopes to release more information later this year with regards to game play details and beta plans

3792484 the subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the structured credit groups holdings of exotic products opaque valuations and high leverage
3792485 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the writedown had the potential to undermine market confidence
3792486 this incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board
3792487 our overall control framework remains sound and we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review
3792488 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
3792489 in the same way we delete marriages involving fourteen year olds a man with two wives just cannot exist by law
3792490 they are simply acknowledged it is important for us to check that the documents are authentic and that the husband does not have dutch nationality
3792491 he has a closer relationship with lobbyists than he lets on
3792492 the problem for mccain being so closely associated with lobbyists is that hes the candidate most closely associated with attacking lobbyists

3792494 if youre not offended by at least one aspect of this film then youre probably not getting out enough

3792498 i believe in bangalore because bangalore is in my dna
3792499 todays youth especially in bangalore with its mushrooming ites industry has a disposable income earlier in their lives than the older generations hence the catch em young and watch em grow philosophy of the newspapers
3792500 signal recognition of youth power and growing youth activism in the area of bringing social change youth are keen to express their opinions and points of view on various issues and they are interacting with various media to do this
3792501 there is also evidence of a trend of youth going back to reading gauging by the plethora of niche magazines launched across varied subjects or the popularity of indian fiction from young novelists

3792507 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
3792508 to have such a remarkable following and support for the harvest moon series is wonderful and we think fans will be very pleased with this new handheld addition
3792509 island of happiness stays true to the elements of the series that fans love and will provide players an exciting harvest moon universe that will continue to elevate the series to new heights
3792510 a gay stereotype that makes what jar jar binks represented to the island of jamaica look subtle by comparison its not the look or design that pushes it over the top into stereotype of course but the voice performed by corey burden a lispy high pitched twang purposively reminiscent of truman capote
3792511 ziro jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
3792512 he actually said that and we were like wow its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here
3792513 but legitimate agents have relationships with cruise lines that get them offers not available on the websites
3792514 cruise lines really look at how youve booked when they assign upgrades
3792515 i cant remember the last time one of my clients didnt get upgraded
3792516 i monitor cruises from the initial deposit to the sail date for price adjustments
3792517 going on the internet can be time consuming and terribly confusing
3792518 travel agents have resources available so they dont have to search for the answers
3792519 its very important to remember that if you miss the ship on a caribbean island for example you cant fly back without a passport
3792520 some people who book their europe cruise online dont book the air travel right and miss the ship
3792521 you want to develop a relationship with an agent so go on instinct find someone who knows what theyre talking about
3792522 theres no swearing and no sexual talk we keep it pretty clean
3792523 i think some people are just afraid of it that this new concept is going to do something big and they dont want it to
3792524 i say out with the old in the with the new
3792525 people want to put their comments on everything and the faster they can do that the better
3792526 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3792527 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3792528 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3792529 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3792530 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3792531 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3792532 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3792533 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3792534 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3792535 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3792536 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3792537 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3792538 there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3792539 m s vale que esta vereda que andamos se convierta en camino

3792544 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3792545 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
3792546 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits

3792549 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3792550 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3792551 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3792552 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3792553 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy
3792554 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk
3792555 its as close to kabul as logar and thats of a concern to us
3792556 the artwork is lame and repetitive the jokes are either inside software industry jokes or thinly disguised anti capitalist rantings

3792563 the police departments roll will be to do exactly what were doing now except to also issue them a notice to appear for the exclusion hearing
3792564 well thats not exactly true because we have many repeat offenders people who commit the same offenses over and over in the same area

3792568 but it was not the public telling the story it was always a moment of private grief exploited by an elite struggling to find a narrative in which society might meaningfully engage with itself now with each ridiculous headline the cynical core of the media and cultural elites manipulation of a private tragedy comes ever more to the surface and the saddest thing of all is that in turning a family tragedy into a volatile commodity an object for public mourning and anger the genuine loss of the mccanns has been trivialised like stories of pregnant transsexuals or talking dogs its just another tale in the morass of silly season distractions

3792582 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3792583 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3792584 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3792585 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3792586 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3792633 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3792634 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3792635 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3792636 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3792637 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3792638 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3792639 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3792646 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
3792647 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures

3792655 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals
3792656 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalize on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3792657 lonmin has an extensive program of operational improvement that is being implemented by the new and experienced operational mining management team
3792658 xstrata is seeking to capture these benefits which would otherwise accrue to lonmins shareholders
3792659 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3792660 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3792661 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3792662 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3792663 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3792664 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3792665 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3792666 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3792667 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3792668 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3792669 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3792670 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3792671 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
3792672 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
3792673 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
3792674 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3792675 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3792676 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3792677 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3792678 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3792679 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3792680 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon
3792681 certainly hes capable of hitting 260 or 270 we ve seen that
3792682 we were hoping he could maybe do better than that its just been a struggle as of late to get him back to 260 or 270 get his head above water so hes gone backwards a little bit
3792683 my job is to keep plugging away and his job is to keep working
3792684 scott proctor has a sore elbow that will need surgery and he may not pitch again this season they should still try and trade wilson betemit back for him

3792763 president bush and karl rove are attempting to block voter registration of at least 200 000 and possibly as much as 400 000 veterans
3792764 we may have the clock running out on us but we will not give up this needs to be shoved in the face of every single elected official in the country we can fix this in a second we are talking about two or three sentences in legislation we are talking about the integrity of our democracy
3792765 but it is almost physically impossible to get it passed and implemented in time
3792766 and that is a funding bill if we can get any of this legislation tacked onto a funding bill the president has to sign it
3792767 if the other secretaries of state are not as active as we are the va will not do anything for them
3792768 while the hope for 2009 is a real one the practical effect now is that the first voters who have been suppressed by the gop in 2008 are the wounded warriors living in the governments own facilities
3792769 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
3792770 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3792771 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3792772 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3792773 i understand that there are some people who wish to bury any new facts concerning the subject of wmd in iraq they are ready to liquidate any person or group who ventures into this subject
3792774 are not ready to give interviews because that endangers their life it would endanger your life as well i am serious in my warning
3792775 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad
3792776 i request that you adjourn your scheduled trip to baghdad
3792777 if you decide to continue with your intention then i am very sorry to tell you that taking the overall environment in my country i am not able to support your mission the main reason would be to preserve my life during or after it is concluded
3792778 i had made several important contacts in regards to your trip
3792779 as you know the situation inside iraq is very dangerous and confused and many people were hesitant to meet with you
3792780 they were afraid of what the americans might do if it was found out that they had met with you
3792781 they just disappeared into the shadows they are still very much a presence in baghdad and iraq
3792782 mr ritters life is at risk if he comes here as well as the life of any iraqi he meets with
3792783 if he does his life is at risk your life is at risk and everyone associated with his visits life will be at risk
3792784 i guess its just because you are who you are
3792785 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
3792786 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi
3792787 a small problem arose when 2 non english speaking students bound for their first day at karns middle ended up at gresham apparently they just climbed on the first yellow bus they saw
3792788 theyve crunched the numbers and concluded they cant head to the lake after a 20 percent loss in their net worth
3792789 many of my neighbors have also come out of retirement
3792790 besides the satisfaction we get from our jobs were all trying to make sure our nest eggs last as long as we do
3792791 this is just the beginning of a long term trend the changing nature of retirement income will make boomers more and more vulnerable to market downturns
3792792 i talked to my financial planner who thought i could afford to do those things even though im only 60
3792793 im debt free i dont even have a mortgage and ive been able to save for my retirement
3792794 im not hurting but im wondering whether the economy will deteriorate further
3792795 we look at what would happen to their nest egg if the market collapsed the day after they retired
3792796 then we see whether theyd have enough time to recover and enough money to live on throughout retirement
3792797 anyone who withdraws too much in a bear market especially early in retirement will outlive his money
3792798 a good rule is to take out no more than 4 percent a year that should keep a portfolio going for many years
3792799 if the market were better i wouldnt work at all
3792800 but my cardiologist tells me i may live to be 95 and my mutual funds certainly arent giving me the kind of returns ill need to last that long
3792801 because i dont see myself sitting at home and eating cat food i will keep chasing consulting jobs
3792802 even those who dont plan to move after retirement are still psychologically affected by falling home values
3792803 they look at their net worth on paper and feel poorer so they continue working
3792804 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3792805 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3792806 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3792807 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3792808 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3792809 i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3792810 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed

3792816 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3792861 el animal es un buen vector de enfermedades en asia pero no fuera de su h bitat
3792862 eso no significa necesariamente que sea un buen vector para ello deben darse muchos factores
3792863 para que un mosquito pueda transmitir un virus primero tiene que chupar sangre infectada y tras un tiempo de incubaci n sus gl ndulas salivares quedan contagiadas cuando el mosquito perfora la piel expulsa saliva que llega a los capilares sangu neos con los virus que infectan al hu sped por tanto transcurre un periodo de tiempo desde que el mosquito adquiere su dosis infecciosa hasta que se hace contagioso

3792893 i am calling to ask governor schwarzenegger to veto any pro illegal alien legislation like the california dream act and to do more to combat illegal immigration on the state level his promise to keep ca from giving licenses to illegal aliens is not enough a historic number of states have voted to crack down on illegal immigration this year and no states have passed laws that give benefits to illegal aliens yet we need california to do a better job of fighting illegal immigration and we need governor schwarzenegger to show some backbone on this issue
3792894 im calling to ask governor rick perry to do more to combat illegal immigration in texas he should consider calling the tx legislature into a special emergency session to address the issue since many state lawmakers have indicated they want to pass immigration enforcement legislation as soon as possible texas is becoming a border disaster area due to illegal immigration and many texans are dying because of the lack of federal and state action
3792895 im calling to ask immigration and customs enforcement to increase the number of raids the numbers of illegal aliens arrested and the number of employers charged with crimes nationally with special focus on the high impact states of california and texas recent studies show that immigration enforcement encourages many illegal aliens to leave on their own americas illegal immigration crisis is the result of ices under enforcement of our existing immigration laws i want to see ice go into high gear and crack down hard nationally and in ca and tx

3792907 despite much excitement generated by recent advances in the knowledge of brain development and function the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of depression as well as its amelioration by ad treatment remain poorly understood
3792908 our data establish an essential cell autonomous role for trkb in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to antidepressive regimen in mice
3792909 the dna is released out of the cell in less than a second
3792910 we dont know how eosinophils are capable of catapulting mitochondrial dna so quickly
3792911 our findings support a role for nmdar dependent modulation of da neurons in cue induced relapse to drug seeking
3792912 our findings link nmdar signaling in da neurons with relapse behavior and provide a new rationale in the treatment of cocaine addiction specifically the selective activation of the glur1 subunit could potentially improve the outcome of any given exposure therapy
3792913 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
3792914 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
3792915 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
3792916 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

3792919 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3792920 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3792921 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3792922 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
3792923 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3792924 our responsibility to protect unborn children includes considering the legal framework for abortions and also supporting pregnant and single mothers and ensuring all children are welcomed and supported what is the position of political candidates on the protection of unborn children what do they say about the social and economic circumstances which contribute to higher or lower rates of abortion
3792925 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

3792936 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3792937 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3792950 we simply want to try to introduce young jews who havent had the opportunity to learn about judaism
3792951 they go to university and might be well versed about science mathematics and literature but their jewish education may be very fragile
3792952 aishcafe was kind of the beginning of wanting to know more about judaism and really identify with my judaic roots
3792953 to me it was an avenue for religious growth that was something i wanted to do for a while and this was an opportunity to do it
3792954 i really felt i had something i could relate to
3792955 for me and for a lot of people theres a sense that religion can be backwards but this shows it in another light
3792956 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3792957 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3792958 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3792959 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3792960 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3793003 a key challenge is making the technology sufficiently autonomous that it does not require high levels of skill and attention to operate it
3793004 current systems often take two or three specially trained soldiers to operate them and cant be used by front line troops where the information is most needed
3793005 the military have an urgent requirement for surveillance support in urban environments and its likely they would deploy any new technology immediately if it was shown to be effective

3793023 copycat systems are coming up like putting bombs in vehicles near hospitals soon after blasts knowing that large congregations will be there and impact will be much greater

3793032 this is being done by an expert team which includes some of the most respected creative talent in the world who really know how to tell a story on the internet and weve designed a highly sophisticated plan both financially and artistically to create a worldwide phenomenon
3793033 the promise of the internet is how it allows us to mix reality with fantasy

3793051 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3793052 amenable to healthcare before age 75 between 1997 98 and 2002 03

3793054 it should be covered if they deny it ill fight for you
3793055 here lies joe the government spent xxxx just to put him into a pine box after 72 years
3793056 since we dont have a lot of customers we are going to raise the rates to the one big assed customer and game the system we will of course do this each and every year and you will have to raise taxes but this takes this to a fixed cost and fixed supply system they will know what to get each year and they will simply with hold it until they get what they want for it
3793057 re the pharmaceuticals thats about what i pay now under my insurance plan you know thats the one that i had the choice to purchase or not this is the divergence we will hit and inflation will go runaway here but this is an experiment they have to have a mandate to make it work and that means it becomes part of the taxation system voluntary it will never work if it is buyer monopoly what do you do if they dont want to sell it to you for that price beg threaten a takeover

3793060 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results
3793061 it is because of them that i am able to get this far
3793062 perhaps its the occasion of playing at the olympics you dont get a chance to play here often so i told myself i must do better
3793063 i dont want my tournament to end in the next match i want to do the best that i possibly can
3793064 we all played very well the fielders hit especially well and scored a lot of runs so i could pitch wholeheartedly
3793065 be prepared for whatever happens dont miss memorable moments because you left your camera home
3793066 if there is a bright light behind the subject the on camera flash is often enough to fill in the face in shadow if not use a reflector to throw light onto the face
3793067 i have used things as simple as a styrofoam sandwich box to bounce light onto a face when your subject is very dark against a bright background youll wind up with a silhouette many point amp shoot cameras have a nighttime portrait setting i prefer late afternoon light so summer baseball games are great places to take pictures i usually use the olympus e3 with the 12 60mm lens i have always been happy with my olympus lenses because the white balance and rendition of color is exactly how i see the world
3793068 its best to catch them unaware or youll wind up with those toothy smiles which can be charming but repetitive
3793069 when they are busy doing their favorite things they will be so involved theyll forget you are there
3793070 i love movement i like to photograph people jumping dancing whatever motion i can capture
3793071 to freeze the motion without flash make sure you use a fast shutter speed no slower than 1 250 second 1 1000 second if you want to really freeze the action if you dont have enough light try boosting your iso i like to see a bit of a blur so sometimes i pan the action when it is dark enough i use a slow shutter speed and an on camera flash to stop the action
3793072 i love to capture people jumping dancing swinging to freeze the motion without flash use a fast shutter speed when it is dark outside use a slow shutter speed and on camera flash to stop the action
3793073 usually the best light is in early morning or late afternoon after a storm its often quite beautiful i find that after rain greens become very rich in digital pictures
3793074 often the most interesting pictures are those you take right in your own environment because you know where and when the light is best
3793075 were pleased were meeting our goals in that regard and its not going to be all about the money
3793076 you always need to be raising money and thats certainly a big part of it but my strategy is also to be out there talking to the voters
3793077 my long history with the fair ive been here almost 20 years and i understand the people i know the dynamics i know whats important to people
3793078 im in touch with that and i keep that ever present as we determine what things can be changed what traditions can be tweaked a bit
3793079 we embrace the virginians that support our fair and just by the nature of the geography and the fact that were half an hour away from the border we depend on those folks we also try to be very cognizant of the parts of the state that are further away and building partnerships with companies in those areas
3793080 these events are a great fun idea and will build interest in the olympics games bringing communities together
3793081 die berliner mauer ist auch nach ihrer berwindung ein symbol entsetzlicher politischer verirrung und damit verbunden mit vielen menschlichen trag dien
3793082 dass die abschottung der eigenen bev lkerung gegen unerw nschte informationen kontakte oder ver nderungen immer eine politische bankrotterkl rung ist und dem bed rfnis der menschen nach freiheit und selbstbestimmung auf dauer nicht widerstehen kann

3793088 ello va a ser considerado por la organizaci n internacional como agresi n contra todos los sindicatos no s lo de m xico sino del mundo ya que tambi n se experimentan abusos del mismo tipo en colombia per guatemala costa rica y en general toda am rica latina
3793089 si las empresas en am rica latina se est n globalizando y los gobiernos sometiendo a sus dictados los nicos que podemos contrarrestar esa situaci n somos los obreros los campesinos y la sociedad en general

3793094 el anuncio del cese de las acciones militares por parte de rusia es una noticia que esper bamos
3793095 es normal que la comunidad internacional desee garantizar la soberan a la integridad territorial y la seguridad de georgia
3793096 es normal que rusia desee defender los intereses de sus ciudadanos en su pa s y de las personas rusohablantes fuera de las fronteras de rusia
3793097 determinar el orden de las medidas necesarias para volver a las posiciones de partida

3793104 el enemigo dentro de esa supuesta concepci n nacionalista que pueda anidar en algunas bases de una organizaci n terrorista o de un fen meno social que justifica la pr ctica de la violencia de eta es el pnv
3793105 ese movimiento va evolucionando a un fen meno de radicalizaci n incluso con una diferencialidad con respecto a afinidades supuestamente ideol gicas que pudieran haber existido en generaciones anteriores
3793106 lo que me preocupa realmente de ese mundo de cara a una posible resocializaci n e reinserci n en la sociedad es que est alimentado en el odio
3793107 a josu erkoreka no le neg que ese acuerdo con pp rechazara un final dialogado de la violencia
3793108 haber una garant a para que nadie pueda valerse en la ambig edad de que no ha habido un pronunciamiento sobre el final definitivo de la violencia y ma ana sale una escisi n pasado ma ana no s qu organizaci n
3793109 tiene que haber un pronunciamiento de final definitivo de la violencia por parte de eta y dentro de ese fen meno adyacente al terrorismo tiene que haber un final dialogado que no tiene que contemplar objetivos pol ticos
3793110 alguna informaci n podemos tener tambi n el pnv de que hay un malestar dentro de ese mundo en el que se llega a la reflexi n de si hay presos de primera y de presos de segunda en la medida en que hay una directriz de no abonar fianzas para salir en libertad condicional y sin embago hay quien sale en libertad condicional mediante el pago de fianza sobre si retomando experiencias anteriores hay una contestaci n tambi n a la v a de la pr ctica de la violencia
3793111 creemos que hay un debate intenso y es l gico porque hay personas que llevan m s de 20 a os en la c rcel

3793134 ya que el ipc interanual sigue estando por encima de las estimaciones del gobierno que eran del dos por ciento
3793135 es falso que la empresa deba 890 millones de d lares porque se confunden los pasivos con la deuda

3793220 before the flood people started to write marriage contracts between men in other words homosexual marriage which is more than homosexual activity its giving an official state stamp of approval a sanctification of homosexual partnership
3793221 the writings indicated that it wasnt even so much the straw that broke the camels back but that the sin in and of itself is so contrary to why god created the world so contrary to the order of gods nature that god said then and there i have to start all over to annihilate the world and start from the beginning
3793222 even in ancient greece they did not write marriage contracts between men there was homosexuality and it was wrong but there was not an official blessed policy marriage is sanctification not simply a partnership
3793223 probably one of the greatest sins of all that one does against gods plan for this world
3793224 a plan that asks volunteers to stand with the people the christian civic league recruits to collect signatures for the petition
3793225 these questions are some of what drive the non political online outreach
3793226 is it not ridiculous to assert we would photoshop a photo to bolster the boycott to lie would that not destroy our purpose the photo is authentic taken at the actual mcdonalds by the protesters themselves it was not altered but it is real
3793227 dr dobson isnt close to an endorsement of anyone in the 2008 race

3793238 radical homosexual activist matt foreman of the gay and lesbian task force spoke in a very irresponsible manner slandering the reputations of christian ministers in broward county by inferring that they are in some way responsible for the murder of simmie williams
3793239 foreman is guilty of gross christian bashing the very kind of bashing he says he opposes against homosexuals
3793240 radical homosexuals like foreman are quick to exploit this tragic situation for their own political purposes and in order to bash christians
3793241 matt foreman owes the ministers of broward county an apology
3793242 faithful christian churches must oppose homosexual behavior just as they must oppose other behavior they consider to be sinful but where is the proof that any minister has ever suggested or condoned violence
3793243 the fact is no one knows who killed simmie williams jr or why it is pretty safe to assume that the murderer was not a church member acting on advice from his pastor
3793244 now i understand perfectly why stalin hitler mao et al believed themselves sinless
3793245 its just like if a police officer chats to somebody its part of the investigative process

3793274 whereas once it was seen as a risk to populations everywhere it was now recognised that outside sub saharan africa it was confined to high risk groups including men who have sex with men injecting drug users and sex workers and their clients
3793275 we face a bit of a crisis in this area in the industrialised world transmission of hiv among men who have sex with men is not declining and
3793276 in the developing world it has been neglected we have only recently started looking for it and when we look we find it and when we examine hiv rates we find they are high
3793277 it is astonishing how badly we have done with men who have sex with men it is something that is going to have to be discussed much more rigorously
3793278 growth was minimal from 2000 to 2006 and it fell some years but 2007 was fantastic as business aviation traffic picked up around asia and economies did well we believe that this years figures will build on that growth and we should start implementing measures to boost that

3793291 damn lucky smiles i certainly know that i have a chance thats one in a million and a job thats sort of disposable and i feel lucky that i havent been found out
3793292 i constantly recognise my incredible luck and am reminded of it every day when i talk to friends who said that they waited three hours for a casting call and they got to the door and it was shut in their face i was in the right place at the right time
3793293 no my head is screwed on pretty good and i just take it as it comes i suppose
3793294 i think it depends on where you come from and what kind of family you come from
3793295 i dont know thank you for saying im down to earth because you really dont know me i could be just a total prissy loser laughs but you know i guess i dont adjust thats probably why i stay the same laughs
3793296 oh definitely i mean thats a given women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3793297 it was fantastic to not only live with that music i love every day but to work with such wonderful musicians
3793298 jennifer doesnt understand his fascination with it she says its weird
3793299 lance had all of the qualities kate wanted in a mate
3793300 she throws herself into these relationships quickly then shes just over it
3793301 they just decided to end things theres no hatred just sadness
3793302 shes super need y and must be the center of someones attention
3793303 they were having problems and he ended it i think shes also still hung up on owen
3793304 but bretts had a girlfriend for three years brett and kate are just friends
3793305 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast
3793306 wont work lance already made it clear they are 100 percent done
3793307 they gave each other a kiss that lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
3793308 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3793309 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3793310 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3793311 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3793312 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3793313 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3793314 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3793315 top 3 candidates the liberal media is pushing have not yet confirmed that they will be at the debate rudy mitt romney john mccain their campaigns are citing scheduling conflicts and raising money

3793318 out from under should be read by every legislator lawyer physician and mental health professional in a position to lobby for the best interests of children may society heed dawn s courageous testimony and spare other innocents the suffering she and her siblings sustained
3793319 out from under is a personal account told in an emotional narrative stefanowicz tells of the enormous burden that was thrust upon her as a young person a burden that is too great for any child this story compels one to ponder the vulnerability of children human suffering and the meaning of life itself
3793320 dawn stefanowicz has the courage to write a politically incorrect book she has the right because she was raised in a homosexual environment and suffered because of it there are few books like this one which argues that such environments are disturbing to children
3793321 our dart conference is more relevant now than ever before
3793322 we highly recommend attendance by aid groups missionaries members of the military and anyone else who wants to learn how to stay alive in dangerous situations
3793323 the refugee camp is an important component of our conference
3793324 this field training is important because retention of information dramatically increases when its learned through real life application
3793325 this conference is a must for missionaries and aid workers
3793326 attendees will acquire invaluable skills and information that may very well save lives in the future
3793327 to formulate an equal employment policy that does not make reference to any matters related to sexual interests activities or orientation
3793328 these two men have the same constitutional rights as everyone else to pass out literature on a public sidewalk we are pleased that the court agrees that these men should not have been arrested and dismissed the charges against them
3793329 there may be a few homosexuals or lesbians who will tell you that they have never had issues and they were just

3793332 she has made the comment that well its not as if they can change
3793333 i wanted to know the purpose of showing the film her reasoning was because it was to show these homosexual couples cannot have children of their own and how this affects society
3793334 she became very angry at me and told me she didnt want to discuss this
3793335 this is a long post but there have been a lot of things going on out there that i need to discuss
3793336 this comes to mind because my friend stacy harp over at active christian media is in the thick of it with a number of pro sin of homosexuality bloggers and other folk
3793337 the bible contains the mind of god the state of man the way of salvation the doom of sinners and the happiness of believers

3793344 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3793345 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3793346 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3793347 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3793348 emerson is eager to continue its longtime presence in the batesville region with the re opening of this facility
3793349 we look forward to working with state officials and the local community during this exciting period of expansion for our copeland scroll operations
3793350 this shows how maintaining relationships can lead to new opportunities and can bring jobs to arkansas
3793351 emerson is using existing infrastructure to restart its batesville operation in a new direction and the state of arkansas will continue working with emerson toward the success of this investment
3793352 so i immediately identified that as similar and through a course of investigation we were able to identify that as the same letter writer mr haynes
3793353 he advised us he was very concerned about what was going on in the united states and he wanted to see if he could get commissioner greene to act on some of the things that were bothering him and that was the intent according to haynes
3793354 the main thing is we just wanted to put the fears of the commissioner to rest that we know who this individual is and we talked to him
3793355 we made our presentation to the state attorneys office and theyre not going to file on him

3793360 two years ago i had decided to add a ccf fund pcrix to my asset allocation but i was not able to add it then with required minimum without affecting the overall desired allocation in the portfolio

3793365 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3793367 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3793368 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3793369 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3793370 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3793371 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3793372 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3793373 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3793374 people are using restaurants very differently these days as lifestyles have changed weve really had to contemporize and create modern relevant in restaurant experiences

3793379 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3793380 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3793381 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3793382 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3793383 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations

3793388 la bbc trasmette anche puntate di top gear sui suoi canali televisivi internazionali come bbc world gli episodi sono accorciati rispetto alla lunghezza originaria che di unora a 30 minuti lasciando spesso in sospeso dei riferimenti e creando perci delle inconsistenze in aggiunta qualche volta la scaletta originaria non viene rispettata cos che i riferimenti a degli eventi non ancora andati in onda sono comuni lunico spezzone girato espressamente per la versione internazionale alla fine di ogni episodio quando clarkson saluta i telespettatori di bbc world invece che quelli della bbc
3793389 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time
3793390 were in the top 35 and thats been our big deal and i know once we get in were not going to fall back out the car was good jimmy like usual used awesome strategy
3793391 jimmy has done a great job just coming over here and all the additions that jay frye general manager has added to the team
3793392 we have been running well and we just needed some luck on our side and some good strategy
3793393 jimmy has brought that along even at pocono we wanted a better run than 19th but we did a good job to get that out of it all we have to do is keep continuing now that were in the top 35 and no reason to fall out
3793394 ci ho pensato su e alla fine credo sia meglio restare a casa e non rischiare

3793397 zich voor te bereiden op oorlog en de banier van de jihad te hijsen
3793398 die doelstelling is bereikt maar dat betekent niet dat het tornooi voorbij is het duel tegen itali is ook maar een wedstrijd die 90 minuten duurt alles kan we moeten hetzelfde doen als in onze vorige drie wedstrijden in een tornooi hangt het vaak af van details we moeten geloven dat we die wedstrijd kunnen winnen nu trekken we naar peking en slapen voor het eerst in het olympisch dorp ik heb er al veel leuks over gehoord
3793399 er zijn mensen wier welzijn in gevaar is en waar niemand zich zorgen om lijkt te maken
3793400 we hebben de verwachtingen ingelost we verdienden deze overwinning want we waren de betere ploeg alleen hadden we iets meer moeten scoren maar drie punten zijn drie punten we mogen blij zijn maar ook niet te lang want nu moeten we ons focussen op de volgende wedstrijd tegen itali die nieuw zeelander kwam te laat bij zijn tackle maar ik was toch verbaasd dat de ref rood trok ja

3793403 does not exist on fiber networks or on services provided by satellite operators or iptv providers
3793404 just as dtvs do today tru2way dtvs will work with a competing providers service if the dtv is connected to a providers set top box that is a directv set top for directv service a verizon set top with verizon service or an at amp t set top for at amp t service
3793405 consumer electronics manufacturers are also completely free to put connections on their tru2way dtvs and set top boxes so those devices can access internet video and no cable license stands in the way
3793406 verizons suggestion that all dtvs include an rj45 ethernet input port is worth exploring with ce manufacturers
3793407 although the rule seemed to make some sense when it was adopted five years ago the 1394 output is largely unused today and imposes substantial costs that are borne by cable operators
3793408 bei mir gibt es keine erste elf und dann die ersatzspieler
3793409 ich habe gy r im spiel gegen debrecen von unserem scout erwin hadewicz beobachten lassen
3793410 da haben sie nicht den st rksten eindruck hinterlassen es ist aber ohnehin wichtig dass wir uns auf uns selbst konzentrieren wir m ssen die beste leistung abrufen und unser spiel durchziehen
3793411 jan ist pr destiniert f r die position hinter den spitzen
3793412 es gibt bei mir nicht die erste elf und dann die ersatzspieler
3793413 ich kann nur sicher sagen dass jens lehmann im tor stehen wird
3793414 wenn alle spieler gesund bleiben reicht unser kader f r die drei wettbewerbe was allerdings passieren kann wenn es verletzte gibt hat man in der vergangenen saison im schlussspurt an leverkusen gesehen
3793415 im mittelfeld sind wir sehr variabel und im sturm sind wir auch gut aufgestellt
3793416 wir arbeiten das ganz jahr ber auf den internationalen wettbewerb hin
3793417 we denken dat in de documenten die vorige nacht voorgelegd werden aan moskou en tbilisi het belangrijkste element ontbreekt namelijk het respect voor de territoriale integriteit van georgi
3793418 de enige optie om gelijkaardige daden van agressie en bezetting tegen georgi te verhinderen is het land op te nemen in het actieplan voor lidmaatschap
3793419 hoje nosso jogo da vida contra o flamengo temos que nos doar e fazer o m ximo no domingo o m rcio est desde o come o do ano conhece todo o grupo e tem a nossa confian a estamos recebendo apoio incondicional e irrestrito da torcida e esperamos sair de campo felizes no domingo

3793426 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3793427 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3793428 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3793478 digital provides business segmentation and succession solutions for small firms and independent agents who want to sell retire or focus on other business but still care about the quality of service delivered to their customer base
3793479 after spending years building their small group book of business some agents may have little opportunity to gain liquidity or retire with peace of mind digitals eight year track record of partnering with brokers and agents to efficiently manage their small group health insurance accounts uniquely positions us to acquire such business and continue delivering enhanced service
3793480 as part of our growth strategy we sold our small group accounts to digital insurance
3793481 our core capabilities and customer value proposition increasingly focused on employer groups with 100 to 5000 employees as a result we needed to commit to or transition out of the small group segment we searched diligently for a partner that could not only purchase this block but also provide the service and commitment level that we required for our former small group customers the transition went smoothly and customer retention has been surprisingly high
3793482 the volume of business weve closed in a short period of time reflects a market need as well as our aggressive efforts to identify agents and agencies seeking to transition their small group business
3793483 we are presenting opportunities to sole proprietors who want a cash infusion or to sell their independent insurance agency as well as brokers and financial planners who desire market differentiation time to focus on core business or a segmentation strategy to grow upstream

3793485 with the popularity of machinima and user generated content online providing an easy to use video mashup tool focusing on game content is the logical next step and partnering with gorillaspot provided the most feature rich video mashup application out there we looked at the marketplace and there was a clear opportunity as nobody had yet created a mashup experience for video game related content

3793487 after reviewing a range of strategic alternatives we are confident that partnering with mgop and macquarie a world class investment firm with significant experience across the aviation sector and access to capital is a natural fit
3793488 with the sponsorship of macquarie global opportunities partners this new company will be well capitalized and well positioned to continue building industry leading jet membership retail charter brokerage and fuel management programs under the sentient brand
3793489 we are excited to be acquiring sentients jet membership retail charter brokerage and fuel management company each of these business units has a strong track record of profitable growth we are confident that the experienced management team and employees within these businesses led by former sentient ceo steven hankin will be ideally positioned to manage the new company going forward under our ownership sentient will continue its focus on quality safety and exceptional service as well as leveraging its proprietary systems that make it a leader in its industry

3793506 in elderly patients with dementia cognitive decline is frequently accompanied by disturbances of mood behavior sleep and activities of daily living which increase caregiver burden and the risk of institutionalization
3793507 the circadian timing system is highly sensitive to environmental light and the hormone melatonin and may not function optimally in the absence of their synchronizing effects in elderly patients with dementia synchronization may be diminished if light exposure and melatonin production are reduced
3793508 in conclusion the simple measure of increasing the illumination level in group care facilities improved symptoms of disturbed cognition mood behavior functional abilities and sleep melatonin improved sleep but its long term use by elderly individuals can only be recommended in combination with light to suppress adverse effects on mood the long term application of whole day bright light did not have adverse effects on the contrary and could be considered for use in care facilities for elderly individuals with dementia

3793525 saakaschwili glaubt es noch unter dem amerikanischen pr sidenten george w bush schaffen zu k nnen wenn der demokratische kandidat barack obama an der macht sein sollte wird der georgische beitritt zur nato erstmal auf mehrere jahre verlegt die nato kann nur staaten aufnehmen die keine separatistischen probleme auf ihren territorien haben es klingt wahnsinnig dass jemand einen krieg f hrt um in die nato zu kommen aber bis die frage um die separatistischen republiken s dossetien und abchasien nicht gel st ist kommt georgien nicht hinein

3793546 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3793547 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3793548 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3793549 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3793550 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3793551 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3793552 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3793553 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3793554 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3793555 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese

3793560 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3793561 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3793562 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3793563 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3793564 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3793565 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3793634 meine erfahrung ist in deutschland nicht so gro wie bei anderen rallyes aber ich wei dass das auto auf asphalt sehr gut ist also freue ich mich zu sehen was wir ausrichten k nnen das letzte mal waren wir im januar auf asphalt also wird es einige etappen dauern um sich wieder daran zu gew hnen bei unserem letzten auftritt 2005 erzielten wir hier platz f nf so ein resultat auch in diesem jahr w re phantastisch das super spezial am sonntag wird spa machen es ist eine wundervolle stadt voller fans
3793635 in der vergangenheit hatte ich einige wirklich gute resultate in deutschland und in diesem jahr werde ich im weltmeisterschaftsauto hoffentlich daran ankn pfen k nnen
3793636 ich denke es wird eine herausfordernde rallye f r mich weil ich sie erst einmal bestritten habe ich werde mich darauf konzentrieren meine performance aus dem letzten jahr zu verbessern und den asphaltspezialisten n her zu kommen ich mag die offeneren normalen abschnitte aber ich finde die etappen auf dem truppen bungsplatz schwierig ich brauche es dass auto flie en zu lassen auf diesen etappen ist es ein ziemliches stop amp go und du kommst einfach nicht in einen guten rhythmus
3793637 losing sachin tendulkar at this point of time can be crucial it is very difficult to fill the space when it comes to sachin he not only contributes with the bat and the ball his impact in the dressing room is great
3793638 players look up to him and he always come up with brilliant suggestion and advices on the field as well talent wise and advice point of view it is very difficult to fill in his space
3793639 at the same time cricket goes on it is upto the guys who have been given a chance over here to perform and to prove that they are good enough for international cricket
3793640 at times we have seen that when such a thing arises in the international scenario the youngsters come up they accept the responsibility they take it as a challenge hopefully it will be great to see someone who has just made his mark in the international level to really perform at the top

3793647 como representante de una provincia de la patagonia argentina es importante tener una aerol nea fuerte como lo ser a aerol neas si vuelve a ser controlada por el estado que cumpla con destinos extremos como tierra del fuego

3793660 nationals manager manny acta argued that the ball had not hit easley television replays seemed to indicate that the ball hit neither easleys helmet nor his bat and it might have been merely a wild pitch off the glove of catcher jes s flores
3793661 on the mall side youve got a lot of retailers with very very good balance sheets and they can weather the storm far better than the little guys with the community centers
3793662 with simons size and stable of high quality tenants we expect this company to weather any economic storm and we continue to rate its shares at top pick
3793663 cbls valuation remains compelling but in our view the weak second quarter 2008 operating results are likely to overshadow the valuation
3793664 operations remained very resilient despite a much tougher economic environment
3793665 i dont care who started it youre all in trouble
3793666 the problem is that people might over interpret this and stay in the sun for hours
3793667 it would be false prudence to stay out of the sun to prevent skin cancer and not get enough vitamin d
3793668 the time in the sun needed to get enough vitamin d is much less than the time it takes to tan or burn

3793676 he had a big interest in defending the russian nationalism the russian pride also he wanted to unmask the evils of the empire while studying it he discovered it was very easy to discover that among the architects of this gulag system meaning this system of imprisonment were many many jews
3793677 an israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name
3793678 if solzhenitsyn writes that there were many jews in the nkvd it will increase the passions of anti semitism which has deep roots in russian history i think it is better not to discuss such a question now

3793684 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
3793685 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
3793686 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3793687 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3793688 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3793689 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3793690 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3793691 its the second day of school because friday was really a practice run

3793696 in our rural empowerment programs it is critical to realize full self sustainability on every level the total health center will begin to fund the operational needs of the community center as well as provide a very nice personal income for all of the total health consultants before they move onto owning their very own total heath center franchise
3793697 other than john darer no one seems to be doing anything
3793698 thank you for being the inspiration that you are and for being a strong advocate for integrity in our business
3793699 i commend you on your effort to make a difference
3793700 he is a fabulous writer who has a great passion for the structured settlement industry i commend him on the passion he invokes when he writes on his blog listed above that type of commitment and passion is hard to find and is rare in this world
3793701 i love your weblog keep me on your e mail list
3793702 well done john that is an outstanding piece of work
3793703 i just read your blog about bair vs darer great stuff
3793704 the man who wants to be in our legislature was there at peachtree settlement funding at the time of

3793710 were traveling to about two dozen cities mostly on the east coast including miami philadelphia and new york but will hop to the west coast in february for a tour ending swing through californias central valley with concerts in bakersfield fresno and sacramento its an old fashioned barn storming tour in the true sense of the term a different city almost every night
3793711 we were conscious of the fact that the beatles appeal is not only timeless and cross generational but particularly hot at the moment with use of these classic songs in film a las vegas show and on american idol
3793712 but i also want to point out that what distinguishes the fresno philharmonic is our ability to present some of the greatest and most difficult works more commonly seen on the seasons of the los angeles philharmonic and san francisco symphony our musicians have risen to some big challenges in recent years and next year will be no different our season ending program with till eulenspiegel and mahlers first symphony is a prime example throughout the season well explore some wonderful new repertoire together such as william waltons stirring first symphony in november and in september well perform a fantastic under appreciated symphony by paul creston which i recorded for naxos during my tenure with the national orchestra of ukraine also in my efforts to recognize the highest level of creativity here in fresno we will present a world premiere by local composer jack fortner on our september program
3793713 we hope that the union doesnt take any industrial action but if they do it is difficult to say just exactly how things will be affected mainly because we dont know precisely what action the union plan to take
3793714 it was in between mountains so they couldnt go anywhere
3793715 they were happy to eat and to know that they wouldnt get killed
3793716 we were not allowed to hit them or take their stuff they were well fed
3793717 we were from louisiana and we were all speaking french an officer overheard us asked if we spoke french and we said yes
3793718 you could tell they would send them in to get information to where we were bivouacked when we found them we would arrest them and bring them to the captain
3793719 we were lucky we werent included in the invasion nobody would have been back
3793720 the troops would come from the front line and they wanted to go to the brothel
3793721 but john theriot and i were on guard duty there to see that no americans could go in
3793722 robert m truelock from georgia i still remember his name was an american spitfire pilot who crashed and died
3793723 we guarded his body until it was sent home i traced a pattern from my mess kit knife and began carving the knife from his cockpit glass
3793724 our results are very important from a public health perspective
3793725 the u s population is aging rapidly and falls are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among adults age 65 and older falls are associated with an enormous burden to individuals society and to the health care system tai chi as a proven fall intervention may have much to offer in terms of reducing the public health burden of falls and the benefits accrued for prevention
3793726 ge energy is a vital part of greenvilles business community
3793727 ge has been one of the worlds leading suppliers of power generation technologies for over 100 years and the local facility continues to exemplify this commitment to excellence
3793728 the only way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower prices at the pump is for america to rapidly pursue our own energy sources
3793729 america should remove barriers to a wide array of new energy supplies including hydrogen wind solar geothermal hydroelectric clean coal and even technologies we havent yet discovered but the first step to lower energy prices is to allow the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale to expire on october 1st this date also known as american energy freedom day is vitally important to our nations future energy security

3793733 its things that law enforcement only is authorized to see by law and misuse of that information is illegal
3793734 they sign a user access that says i will use this for business purposes
3793735 it can embarrass people it can be used to blackmail people and its simply not for public consumption thats why its confidential
3793736 if they find that this thing has been compromised its a terrible breach of trust it calls into question the integrity of the law enforcement agency

3793760 the care should include prevention early intervention targeted treatments for particular disorders an understanding of developmental processes and continuity of care
3793761 furthermore treatments should be accessible regardless of age gender sexual orientation disability race ethnicity and culture lastly evidence based practice should be cross disciplinary and include collaborations with families schools practitioners and researchers from various health fields
3793762 this is especially true for low income youth for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems ethnic minority youth and those with drug alcohol problems
3793763 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
3793764 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards
3793765 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
3793766 it turns out that mere exposure makes an enormous contribution to how musical competence develops
3793767 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders
3793768 we have developed a light cheap and flexible solution to protect fences buildings ammunition dumps and containers
3793769 these filled aluminium shapes can stand against projectiles and explosives
3793770 we at ntnu arent in the business of producing these things
3793771 our job is to develop work tools that product developers need we make computer models for design and experiment with alloys dimensions and construction the tools for this type of protection need just a little more work before theyre ready
3793772 when a landmine explodes the combination of sand and air pressure tosses the vehicle and the driver up in the air we have to find a method to absorb the pressure something that is lightweight and doesnt take up much space we dont yet have the technology but were working with the design tools that we have already developed
3793773 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3793774 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3793775 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3793776 i think it is more urban im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3793777 i am working with producers who are just amazing the album is due out in the next six to nine months

3793779 i do usually the maid and i will cook together sean and jayden love my spaghetti
3793780 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3793781 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3793782 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3793783 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3793784 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3793785 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3793786 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3793787 the celebrity experience of the olympics is relatively short lived
3793788 outside of a few really devoted people these sports dont have a mass following
3793789 occasionally the olympic family has come in handy but even getting investors through it has been mainly happenstance
3793790 people tell you youre not going to make the olympic team
3793791 i think about those things every day when it comes to business
3793792 olympians have a sense of dedication and focus that is not typical youre talking several standard deviations away from the average once you shift that focus to something else that can be pretty forceful
3793793 some people get excited when they see im a former olympian
3793794 we didnt get one cos we did a u turn before we got that far
3793795 cant let you through without the checked by customs form and stamp
3793796 jaysus sure ye were never checked how could i do something outrageous like that
3793797 wheres yer clearance for a check form and stamp then
3793798 they wont give us one cos were being turfed out
3793799 oh they wont now i have to be looking at ye all night is it
3793800 give them the checked by customs form and stamp or ill shoot ye and then send ye to siberia
3793801 tell ye what get a handfull of forms and stamps from places and people that are entirely unobvious and ill let ye through
3793802 crap no i only want some of the berries not the whole bucket
3793803 arrgh niet all of the berries da some of the berries
3793804 im sorry i broke your front door and ill be back at noon to fix it
3793805 our computer models are indicating that the system could eventually move into the gulf and theres some possibility it could develop into a tropical storm but this would be about at least a week from now seven to 10 days
3793806 were moving into the peak of the hurricane season so all residents should keep an eye on the tropics
3793807 with the conviction in place thats a different circumstance than what existed before the surety bond
3793808 pre conviction was merely an accusation in this case we have someone that stands convicted i understand mr hernandez wants to go home but i would say that is probably true of anyone who is convicted of this
3793809 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3793810 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3793811 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3793812 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3793813 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3793814 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3793815 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3793816 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3793817 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3793818 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3793819 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3793820 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3793821 if nothing changes youre getting to the point where you wont have any fishermen at all
3793822 if the boats cant make it the docks dont make it and the processors dont make it
3793823 its just that you have fewer boats trying to catch them because they cant make any money
3793824 about two years ago i said this industry might be good for another 10 or 15 years
3793825 i dont think its going to last that long unless something changes quick
3793826 if you go and sell everything to the shop youll never make it
3793827 a lot of these guys they dont know how to do anything else
3793828 they cant make the money they were making shrimping so they just stick it out

3793834 brac created a tremendous amount of construction work and employment because of brac a lot of schools passed bonds to keep up with brac and the future growth of el paso
3793835 i attribute it to great leadership in our community and to the citizens who passed a quality of life bond issuance
3793836 theres opportunities everywhere in the city for construction i just finished doing the concrete work at the new federal courthouse in downtown as a subcontractor
3793837 very innovative in their thinking very proactive very customer service friendly and very community oriented
3793838 weve been blessed by this partnership that goes back to 2005
3793839 they are a great organization very professional and a good group to work with
3793840 theres reason to not only think that the el paso economy is strong relative to the rest of the nation but theres opportunity to keep it going into the future
3793841 it really serves as a statement of the tremendous entrepreneurial opportunities here along the border
3793842 i have 93 of them they work very hard and love what they do

3793846 im a good listener and i try to know whether to respond to the people or not sometimes they just need me to listen
3793847 sometimes the guys that come into the resource room just want to talk
3793848 i always think about the fact that they could be my brothers
3793849 at the end of our sessions in the resource room on mondays we always sang amazing grace
3793850 at the end of the concert the guys asked me to come up and join them in singing amazing grace as i walked back to my seat they stood and cheered and clapped in all my 70 years that was the first time i ever had a standing ovation
3793851 they gave me a recycled poster with a picture of the brass doors of the chapel at the mtc on it they know how important recycling is to me
3793852 the men say they feel ive given a lot to them
3793853 but i feel its been mutual ive never feared when ive been there ive just talked to the men and responded to their needs
3793854 we arent supposed to touch the men when were at the mtc
3793855 but this young man helped me down the hill and we had the opportunity to talk he was responding to my needs that time
3793856 she has stayed over night with clients she has been there for them for whatever they need while they are working through the issues they have
3793857 the past is history the future is a mystery the present is a blessing
3793858 sister rita claire always says we need to live in the present
3793859 it has been so much fun to have sister rita claire in my life
3793860 not only do i appreciate her as a personal friend but also for everything she has done in the community
3793861 although the sisters didnt visit our homes they were always a presence in our community
3793862 they were so hospitable and warm after knowing the sisters and being taught by them i felt it was only fitting that i become one
3793863 their stories their lives make a difference in my life
3793864 one woman i visited with although she had been very ill and unable to care for herself read four library books each week and worked several puzzles at the same time those kinds of things really helped me
3793865 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3793866 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3793867 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide
3793868 four persons were killed in the incident but we have no information about any casualty on our side
3793869 if they had not opened fire police would have remained calm they were stopped at various places but they overpowered us they were really aggressive keen to fight

3793872 so far theyve drilled three holes and they havent seen any bottom ash or fly ash
3793873 ash comes from coal fired plants natural resources told me they never had fly ash up here they did have bottom ash but they never buried it
3793874 they would have had to decontaminate the equipment and make sure it was a clean collection
3793875 there is no further analysis as to whether arsenic is present
3793876 we know there is a whole bunch of mulch there
3793877 we were looking for ash so far i see no evidence of ash buried there is some darker soil that might be mulch natural resources admitted they buried mulch
3793878 a major factor in this increase has been the change in

3793883 we are seeing the effects of higher energy costs in retail data through more buying via the internet

3793885 you can easily reach a large group of individuals at once which saves time and money
3793886 its great for keeping up to date with events or scheduling your own

3793888 small businesses are always looking for cheaper way to get a leg up
3793889 but they are much more in depth than that and have a wide appeal anyone can use them to improve their businesss reach
3793890 and we needed to let everybody know where the city stood based on the applications weve received
3793891 were pleased theyre not going to allow them to have a banquet facility with a warming kitchen area
3793892 because that will probably limit the use of the building against them having large parties there
3793893 this wont stop us from having a large group in there
3793894 i think theres a difference between a meeting and a banquet
3793895 the original intention of the facility was for us to be able to hold and conduct the business of the foundation and support university functions we have a number of events that happen throughout the year that would not be classified as a banquet
3793896 theres no question in my mind that if we had this many people here during the first meeting this wouldnt have passed

3793914 i remember that my first ever tournament outside india was in pakistan its great place and i will definitely go there in future when the opportunity comes
3793915 it was the right thing to do but it was a difficult decision to make because of the supply deficit that has ensued and that were trying really hard to remedy right now

3793926 bartlett was the first person to prepare a compound of a so called inert or noble gas
3793927 for that action he deserved a nobel prize although it was never awarded to him he will forever be recognized as a genius by the scientific community for the logical and imaginative procedure he used in that preparation
3793928 the same ingenuity characterized his experimentation in other aspects of inorganic chemistry in department seminars he often enlivened discussions with his thoughtful comments much as did g n lewis in the early 20th century his colleagues will greatly miss the pleasure of his companionship and good humor
3793929 spurred by bartletts success other scientists soon began to make new compounds from xenon radon and krypton with bartletts simple experiment the old law of the unreactivity of the noble gases had disappeared

3793931 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3793932 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3793933 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3793934 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses

3793941 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics
3793942 they also have been giving instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital friday
3793943 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations israel responded by saying that the only assistance rendered to tbilisi was defensive
3793944 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azerbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3794010 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light

3794013 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3794014 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3794015 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3794016 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3794017 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3794018 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3794019 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3794020 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable

3794023 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3794024 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3794025 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3794026 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3794027 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3794028 i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3794029 were representing peterborough and we want to make peterborough proud
3794030 its going to be fun because were going to get to meet other teams like baseball teams and girls field lacrosse it will be fun to see all these different athletes
3794031 because this team since ive been playing for it hasnt made it to provincials we want to show everybody we belong there
3794032 its a different atmosphere you get that olympic feeling with opening ceremonies
3794033 you get bused back and forth to the games and you stay in a college away from your parents its exciting
3794034 we have a good chance to compete because our boys want to compete
3794035 weve pulled off victories we hadnt done before against whitby halton hills and six nations i think that builds confidence they know if they go out and work hard and outwork the other teams anything is possible
3794036 you never get to do it again so you have to do your best and hopefully come out with at least a medal
3794037 we can beat any team in the province if we come to play
3794038 seven games in three days will be rough but if we get our sleep at night we should be fine
3794039 thats why at the start of the year we went with 18 runners and two goalies were a fast team and like to move the ball and move our feet we have to have the runners to play the game we play especially with three games in one day endurance is going to have to be there

3794063 se debe justificar con claridad por qu se han anulado liquidaciones por un valor de 54 millones de euros ya al inicio del 2007
3794064 43 millones lo que representa el 17 por ciento del total pendiente de cobro de estos dos conceptos
3794065 se puede entender que haya errores en determinados cobros o que entre administraciones se mantengan saldos deudores a falta de liquidaci n al finalizar el a o
3794066 sobre todo porque no se trata de prescripciones por transcurso del tiempo sino de anulaciones lo que supone un acto administrativo positivo
3794067 habr que ver cu ntos de ellos como consecuencia de la crisis quedan impagados ya que hay un porcentaje muy alto de impuestos directos e indirectos por cobrar a 31 de diciembre
3794068 entre las p rdidas de las empresas y los negocios montados por la generalitat la falta de diligencia en cobrar lo que se le debe las anulaciones los intereses de demora por retrasos en pagar y las cantidades que ha de devolver a otras administraciones por no llevar a cabo las actuaciones propuestas la generalitat est quemando un 20 por ciento de su presupuesto
3794069 esta falta de diligencia en la gesti n junto con las pol ticas de reducci n de impuestos est dejando los recursos econ micos de la generalitat en m nimos cuando m s se necesitan imposibilitando una salida a la crisis con el menor coste para los trabajadores y por supuesto dejando en meras declaraciones los planes estrat gicos de apoyo a la econ mica que promete diariamente el presidente de la generalitat francisco camps

3794123 the trees are moving water purely as a result of physics
3794124 the wood has to be designed to be safe at the top of the trees which means preventing air bubbles getting into the columns that transport the water
3794125 if you had a straw that was three feet long and sucked up water before attaching it to the bottom of your tongue your tongue would be pulled into the straw solely because of the weight of the water in the straw
3794126 if you do that with a 300 foot column of water it would pull incredibly hard thats what the force is inside the trees cell walls and thats why air bubbles can get in
3794127 the structural modifications needed to satisfy safety requirements eventually will reduce water transport virtually to zero
3794128 i think it is really remarkable that wood cells which are about the size of an eyelash but a little bit fatter with holes on the side can tell us something about how tall a tree can get

3794191 but the two americans presented conflicting views gates vehemently opposes an attack on iran while cheney is the administrations leading hawk barak presented israels assessments of the iranian situation and warned that iran was liable to advance its nuclear program under cover of the endless deliberations about sanctions which have thus far produced little in the way of action he also acknowledged that effective sanctions would require cooperation from russia china and india all of which currently oppose sanctions with real teeth
3794192 israeli officials have therefore urged their american counterparts in recent months to tone down washingtons other disputes with moscow to focus all its efforts on obtaining russias backing against iran for instance they suggested that washington offer to drop its plan to station a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic a proposal russia views as a threat though washington insists the system is aimed solely at iran in exchange for russia agreeing to stiffer sanctions against iran however the administration rejected this idea

3794252 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3794253 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3794254 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3794255 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3794256 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3794257 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3794258 companies in trouble can end up relying too much on one man itv is in danger of finding itself in that situation for a very brief period it made sense for michael grade to serve as executive chairman with no chief executive i did the same for a few months at channel 4 when mark thompson suddenly left to head the bbc
3794259 but after 18 months michael grade remains in the post and the board still lacks the supervision and extra scrutiny a non executive chairman would bring a senior non executive director just cannot do the same job i do not believe the broadcasting industry has insufficient managerial talent to provide a fresh chief executive and in any event it is possible to bring in brains from outside the sector if i were him i wouldnt hang around the next 18 months could be really tough for the uks commercial tv business

3794334 the best thing is being able to go off the dole no one has wanted to take me on
3794335 im feeling at peace for the first time since my arrest 15 years ago and am slowly realising i have a future after all
3794336 i thought the establishment would make a token payment but this is like winning the lottery
3794337 its my lifetime dream coming true im just really excited to do my first race for hall of fame racing dlp and toyota after the year of testing ive done i feel prepared and im ready to get in the car
3794338 my goal when i first got to the nationwide series was to gain the respect of all the other drivers race them hard but race them clean and give them room i accomplished that goal in the sprint cup series i want to do the same thing i want to finish races without any damage and gain the respect of the sprint cup guys i want to race them hard but race them clean
3794339 ive had fun testing the new car for hall of fame racing ive tested at a variety of tracks pocono nashville kentucky and road atlanta so ive had the chance to drive it on different types of tracks its a challenging car to drive more of a challenge than a nationwide series car its got a lot more horsepower and its a lot more top heavy and it doesnt handle as well in the corners you have to drive it a lot harder but its fun with that rear wing because you can lay it out on the line and that rear wing will catch you a little bit
3794340 ive been working out really hard for about the last year and a half the races are long races and theyre very tough not many people know how difficult it is to drive these stock cars on an oval its very physical ive been working out very hard these last couple of weeks ive really stepped up my program and my hydration and im just stepping it up to get ready for these sprint cup races
3794341 from the past experience ive had at michigan ive loved it ive done two arca races there and my worst finish was fifth i did the nationwide series race there last year and finished 15 th we should have had a top 10 but we had a little struggle in the pits its just a really fun race track really wide and you can easily go three wide there im really looking forward to getting out there
3794342 were going to concentrate on qualifying in the top four and bringing home a win at these final two races before the countdown playoffs start the same thing weve been trying to do all season were going for the throat
3794343 qualifying early for the countdown does take a little pressure off and lets us really go for it weve been making some great horsepower with our mopar hemi engine the j amp j crew has been awesome and i really feel like im back on track behind the wheel were not looking to go to the semis were focused on making it to the finals at these last two events and taking a shot at some wins
3794344 weve had a pretty good track record there and ive been to the semis a few times i think
3794345 i really like the track its well prepped the facility is in a nice country setting and its nice and cool there at night if all goes well our mopar j amp j team will be enjoying a nice cool night in the winners circle come sunday
3794346 the other team got the talent we got all the drinkers and geeks
3794347 well do okay we had two practices at brainerd and we looked to have everything set

3794356 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3794357 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3794358 its just a fun place to race its wide open racing and you can run from top to bottom the biggest thing is just trying to get grip here some guys are able to get it other guys cant you can get it for maybe five laps and then youre just out to lunch the biggest thing is just trying to make your car comfortable and make it last throughout a whole tire run and of course make it fast too yeah the wide race track is good thats what makes michigan so exciting and so fun thats the biggest deal about it for me coming to michigan i tend to run well here for whatever reason and the biggest deal is trying to finish and finish up front we ran toward the front there in june but we ended up making a late pit stop and with all the fuel mileage strategy that was going on we ended up getting shuffled back weve had some great runs with the car that we are bringing this weekend so im hoping we can improve on our june finish and keep the momentum going from last weeks win
3794359 my brother moved up to michigan years ago to run in the craftsman truck series and he went to a michigan game he bought me a michigan sweatshirt and sent it home for me i never really paid attention to college football until then but i became a michigan fan not too complicated of a story but its fun to be able to follow them when i have a saturday afternoon off in the fall i was lucky enough to be able to go to their practice last fall and get to know a few of the guys you always respect people who are as competitive as you are and they certainly have the same drive to win that i do
3794360 wed love to be the best every week but its not going to happen weve got to take our bad weeks in stride and move on quickly last week was last week and this week is always a new week thats why when you have a good week and you win like this past weekend you try to keep as level headed as you can because you know the bad weeks are going to be there too i said from the beginning of the year that we just wanted to keep riding and keep going in the way that we have been and fortunately weve been able to do that yeah there have been a couple of weeks when you might fall back a little bit but you look at pocono and we were running fourth before we ran out of gas and then at indy we were running in the top 10 much of the day and circumstances just kept us from finishing there youve got to keep it going in the right direction and not let one particular week get to you you have to keep the mountains and valleys as close as possible
3794361 were just out here to race our race and concentrate on making our car the fastest at the beginning of the weekend and then go out there and try to race with the rest of these guys we know the 48 jimmie johnson is strong but it took him a little longer than normal to get going this year carl edwards has been tough all year especially on tracks like where we are going this weekend in michigan the no 9 car kasey kahne has looked good at times and has had bright spots you also cant count out tony stewart and denny hamlin even though they dont have the wins to show for it no 18 crew chief steve addington and i know what kind of equipment and people they have and the chase really even things out for a lot of guys we just need to keep doing what weve been doing and well be fine we cant control how everyone else runs but if we can keep doing what we have been theres a chance we can get all of them second guessing themselves at times youve just got to keep going and those statements will be made but you cant concentrate on them you have to worry about what you can control
3794362 id rather people dislike me for who i am than like me for someone im not everyone wants to be cheered but i can certainly handle it if im not because i know i go out there and put out my best effort each time i race to me if you want to like me for who i am thats fine i just am who i am im out there to be a fierce competitor and ive got a drive and a fire inside me to go out there and be the best i can with the ultimate goal of winning
3794363 michigan is one of my favorite tracks on the circuit

3794372 crew chief mike green and i have also done very well there before and having him on my side right now is a great thing because we always seem to do well during the latter part of the season
3794373 im very confident right now i know i have a good hot rod under me and i just want to go out there and drive it and have some fun and not look back right now we had a great race points wise last weekend and we clinched a spot in the countdown so we just want to keep on going and forget about the rest of the people and race our own race and race the race track its just about going rounds right now and trying to better our position when they shuffle the points after indy the u s nationals on labor day weekend
3794374 its for draw and its a great cause with the proceeds going to all the injured racers and anybody that really needs help in the drag racing arena they do a great job helping us all out i just want to go out there and put on a good show and have a good time im looking forward to it

3794423 we go to his studios and hes got the video camera thats unbelievable
3794424 and every time i go back there that putter strokes the ball best and works for me so its kind of given me the confidence that its the indian and not the arrow for me so im happy with my arrow its just a matter of me performing
3794425 as far as putting hes full service you can get your putter made you can get it fit you can get your stroke analyzed you can work on your stroke and never leave his building thats why its a studio and not a factory

3794467 but the reality is that you cant do this for another five years the person who does most of the traveling is going to get resentful
3794468 we can use the money were saving to actually travel places together
3794469 we eat in more often and watch movies at home instead of going out as much
3794470 we meet halfway in southern connecticut it gets to the point where as much as you want to make the drive were both starting out and we cant afford it

3794480 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3794481 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3794482 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3794483 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3794484 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it

3794486 kansas speedway and the cordish company have already shown a tremendous commitment to this region having invested hundreds of millions of dollars in two of the most successful regional destinations in the country the kansas speedway and the kansas city power amp light district
3794487 we could not have realized kansas speedway without the unwavering support of state and local leaders our combined vision helped create a world class motorsports facility that continues to provide a significant economic benefit to the community kansas speedway not only attracts hundreds of thousands of fans throughout the year but also serves as a catalyst for new development
3794488 many positive changes to the community have occurred since our arrival and we believe our hard rock hotel amp casino proposal will continue the momentum we started and benefit the taxpayers of kansas
3794489 were very excited about the prospect of a second sprint cup series race at kansas speedway
3794490 a second sprint cup race and a hard rock hotel amp casino would be a tremendous benefit to not only wyandotte county but to the state of kansas
3794491 kansas speedway currently has an economic impact of 243 million to the area the addition of a second sprint cup series race would add another 111 million to the community

3794496 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3794497 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3794498 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3794499 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3794500 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3794501 its just not responsible to be saying things like that

3794506 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3794507 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3794508 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3794509 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3794510 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3794511 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3794512 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3794513 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3794514 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt

3794523 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3794524 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3794525 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3794526 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3794527 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3794528 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3794529 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3794530 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3794544 wed really like for the program to come back but we dont want it to affect the schools budgets
3794545 i think the program was a worthwhile effort but i dont think it was funded appropriately
3794546 with the proper funding it might be a preventative thing there was a very very small percentage tested out of the total number of athletes
3794547 the local players never heard of or saw anyone tested
3794548 the deterrent effect is non existent when kids dont know that testing is actually happening the effectiveness of the program is difficult to judge because the scope was so limited
3794549 i wish it would include steroids because thats the no 1 scare really steroids is the clear danger but the county doesnt obviously have the money

3794551 we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3794552 the democratic party strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3794553 when the actual language of the new proposal is read it still sounds stridently pro abortion
3794554 do the kind of job that i expect of myself
3794555 it would be a difficult seat for a democrat to win but i bet there would have been some competitive democrats in the race

3794569 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3794570 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3794571 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted

3794575 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3794576 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics

3794585 the voices who could help are like rev edgar vanns
3794586 more black leaders but i dont think youre going to see an outpouring from the business community if they thought they could make a difference they would have come out a long time ago
3794587 and i dont believe the mayor is listening to any of them
3794588 the mayors in self survival mode and right now his self interest is far more important than his interest in the city of detroit
3794589 we need to move on as a city a community a region i know people are worried that if he goes who comes hopefully it will be better it cant be worse
3794590 its a lot easier to ask questions than find solutions
3794591 the fact is florida is a diverse state that is becoming even more diverse we know that most of these health disparities are prevalent
3794592 but when you look at a poor less educated population the mortality rates are higher
3794593 many of the chronic diseases that we have found in the community can be prevented or controlled with more health education
3794594 we have to start giving people the tools and we havent been doing it
3794595 ive known chapple for a few years mostly from covering nextel partners up until it was bought by sprint nextel in 2005 as some of you may know nextel partners was an affiliate of nextel communications and was responsible for building and operating rural networks under the nextel brand
3794596 so when sprint bought nextel communications it triggered a clause with nextel partners saying sprint must buy the affiliate it was the price that was up for debate in the weeks leading up to sprints purchase chapple fought like a dog for what he thought was right for shareholders it was a fairly bitter public dispute which manifested itself in lawsuits and back and forth sec filings

3794598 the nextel partners purchase 6 5 billion plus 1 billion in debt is yet another chapter in sprints troubled merger with nextel in february sprint took a noncash on paper goodwill accounting loss of 29 7 billion much of it attributed to the loss in value of nextel nextel partners and other affiliates

3794608 the map this year includes a lot of red states so getting to 60 would be very very difficult but its not out of the question
3794609 the democrats are making the case against a 60 seat senate for us every time they do the bidding of extreme environmentalists and union bosses
3794610 rebecca fisher communications director at the national republican senatorial committee threw her own bucket of cold water on the idea the democrats are making the case against a 60 seat senate for us every time they do the bidding of extreme environmentalists and union bosses she said
3794611 because obamas people have surveyed the superdelegates and are now being confronted with mass defections that seriously endanger his ability to win the nomination on the first ballot
3794612 what are the rules for replacing a senator who resigns mid term which bayh would do if chosen and they win the election isnt it that the sitting governor appoints a temporary senator and then must hold a new election within a few months

3794617 the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by the russian president
3794618 diz alguma coisa mas n o fica a parado me olhando
3794619 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3794620 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3794621 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3794622 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3794623 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3794624 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3794625 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3794626 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3794627 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3794628 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3794629 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3794630 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3794631 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3794632 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3794633 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3794634 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3794635 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3794636 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3794637 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3794638 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case

3794640 while there was a marginal increase in the numbers of students that sat the higher paper in maths this year when you take into account the fact that more students sat the leaving certificate this year compared with last year the numbers are disappointing
3794641 for the past number of years the high failure rate in maths and the small numbers choosing to take higher level has made the headlines it is time to stop posturing and tackle the problem head on radical solutions must be introduced immediately
3794642 between 1999 and 2007 the irish medical devices workforce grew from 16 000 to over 24 000 representing nearly 10 per cent of irelands total manufacturing workforce this employment is sustained by the availability of highly skilled and educated workforce and is particularly reliant on skills in science and engineering subjects
3794643 ireland needs high levels of achievement in science and technology and to realise this a sea change in how we teach how we resource and how we deal with these courses is needed fianna f il has failed to meet the challenges posed by falling participation rates and achievement in maths and the sciences
3794644 there is no doubt that it is a milestone exam and that it marks an important turning point in the life of every student
3794645 however i want to urge them to remember that there is more to life than the leaving certificate the result they received today will not dictate the path their lives take
3794646 it is easy and very understandable to be disappointed if the desired results are not achieved but there is more than one path to any career choice and there have never been more options available for third level education and training opportunities
3794647 today represents the culmination of many months of hard work and commitment for thousands of young people throughout the country may you all receive the success you so richly deserve as you progress to the next exciting chapter of your lives

3794664 building asias largest solar power plant is a landmark moment for the renewable energy sector in korea the success scale and technical sophistication of the project is a model of how we can lead korea into a new era of renewable energy production through strong and trusted partnerships between international experience and technical knowledge korean construction and engineering expertise and ambitious local and federal government planning and policy
3794665 considering the scale high technicality and speed of delivery of this project this is a very significant engineering achievement for korea to celebrate and points to koreas potential as a renewable energy producer korean companies working with strategic partners like conergy can create a vibrant dynamic and self sustaining renewable energy market for korea to benefit from economically and environmentally
3794666 koreas progress in the development of the solar industry is facing a major crossroads beyond 2009 there are serious concerns within the industry as to whether the changes to the feed in tariff policy for large scale projects will be sufficient to encourage more world class developments such as sinan and help reach koreas ambitious target of producing 1gw of solar energy by 2012
3794667 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
3794668 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3794669 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3794670 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3794671 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3794672 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3794673 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3794674 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3794675 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3794676 americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3794677 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3794678 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3794679 that was a good challenge for us because in the final more crews will stay with us for longer
3794680 we have come a long way from the heat but and well have to step on it again but seeing where we have come from over the last three days i would back ourselves to do it
3794681 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3794682 if you want me on the landing then you ought to have me on the takeoff
3794683 its a sad state of affairs when im a federal representative and the people in the community call me to try to reach the state
3794684 its clear this deal is now facing the consequences of the secrecy with which it was negotiated and the lack of impacted parties being part of the negotiation
3794685 russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them
3794686 it was a tough sell before but it was doable simply because we didnt have a choice we dont want to deny ourselves access to the space station the very place we have built and paid
3794687 its going to be a tougher sell now unless there are critical developments during the next 48 to 72 hours
3794688 if i were president id be pulling out all the stops to get russia to understand the consequences of continued bad behavior
3794689 russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them
3794690 he crossed the line because theres certainly the appearance of impropriety there
3794691 i think we should reopen the entire selection process in hopes of generating additional candidates
3794692 i believe that our commission to the extent we possibly can ought to reflect the diversity of the population of florida
3794693 what we have before us today is only an option of selecting a commission that has either no gender diversity or no racial diversity
3794694 we know that approximately 55 percent of the applicants who come before the parole commission are members of our minority communities
3794695 its very desirable to have diversity but fred dunphy has done an excellent job
3794696 im grateful for the cfos comments and appreciate her vote to reappoint me
3794697 we always consider all issues when were voting cases were fair and impartial at the commission
3794698 if you wait until november you may not be able to afford to drive to your polling place
3794699 the people who are doing this they found them on craigslist not everyone is james carville
3794700 his mom was a single parent raising two children and working at the same time
3794701 i am a single parent with two kids his speech he gave on fathers day i support that not just black men but men of every race need to step up to the plate
3794702 i think he has been a factor in the increase said alison berke morano chairwoman of the pasco democratic party
3794703 much in the way that women found empowerment in hillary clinton i believe they black pasco voters found that in barack obama
3794704 i want to see how the country would be with him as president
3794705 i really relate to him we both went through college with student loans my mother was a single mother hes christian and i am too hes just an everyday joe that really appeals to me
3794706 its a new day and a new era and we need a change
3794707 there are no decisions i can make there that i will be roundly applauded for
3794708 even with freezing these positions when we cut the 4 percent thats coming im looking depending on the level of positions at somewhere between 40 and 50 live bodies
3794709 i think weve taken care of the fat already with those 56 that were cut earlier in fact we got into some muscle with that one
3794710 almost everything we do has a constituency so were very carefully going through the process now of prioritizing the things that we do
3794711 there are some things that were doing today that were going to have to stop doing
3794712 it happens all the time it just seems that every year the politicians are doing the same things everybody else is doing
3794713 its a terrible thing when a man gets messed up with an affair but its his business its a private affair so they should let him go and leave it alone
3794714 we were going to elect him as a possible presidential candidate if we cant believe in what he says even in his own private home how are we going to believe in what he says to protect our country and to protect us
3794715 politicians these days are expected to be somehow more clean more proper more righteous more intelligent than the average person
3794716 we hold our leaders to these impossible standards they are guaranteed to fail if you hold them to no wrongdoings
3794717 its certainly not infrequent but at the same time the best estimates suggest that it is not something the majority of people are engaged in
3794718 were all guessing and we dont know how often people do this sort of thing what we do know is that most people assume that everybody else is doing it
3794719 we keep thinking that there are going to be some people that are above all that
3794720 im still reeling from morgan freeman having the car wreck with a woman that was not his wife hes a role model hes the voice of authority the voice of compassion
3794721 we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3794722 i couldnt fix them empty them or rip them off i couldnt see the finish at the 150m wall all i could do was swim
3794723 that is a pretty big accomplishment and definitely something im proud of they have changed their sports themselves so hopefully i can do the same in swimming
3794724 i dont want to say too much about stephen ireland but i think the mans a magnificent talent and ireland need him now
3794725 we could certainly do with him because we dont have an abundance of raw talent and thats where mr trapattonis trouble is going to be in our world cup qualifying campaign
3794726 ive always watched the road to croker its a great show and im delighted that ill have the opportunity to present it on august 21
3794727 just have to clear the head look at the kerry mountains and see what i need to do next
3794728 some say the devil is dead and buried in killarney more say he rose again and joined the
3794729 the brit should be sacked and an irishman should not be let go
3794730 no irishman is going out of the gate while we employ a brit
3794731 if guinness want to keep the irish harp on the pint of stout
3794732 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3794733 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3794734 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3794735 we dont know yet how many men carried out the attack
3794736 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3794737 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3794738 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3794739 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3794740 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3794741 ballymoney has a lot slower pace of life than the big towns and its a very friendly place
3794742 clearly where you live is very important workplace home environment health and social services available whether the roads are safe and good community feeling
3794743 you cant find an answer to the question just by looking at the roscommon area
3794744 robert haynes jr is a registered democrat who votes your public has a right to know
3794745 doing the medias job for them because you guys arent quite the industry you used to be
3794746 he knows how important it is in florida and for the nation
3794747 we seem to be on the same page that we need to have a strong space program
3794748 like everyone said america needs to be the leader on this
3794749 he said the senator does support labor but we already knew that
3794750 if we have a vision we need to pay for that vision
3794751 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3794752 pownce users can now say where they are and geo tag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
3794753 right upon sign up users are given the option to receive regular e mails from yahoo to see if they are still comfortable with sharing this kind of information
3794754 if you do not respond to this e mail yahoo will automatically disable your fire eagle account yahoo also allows users to turn the service off when they want to keep their location private
3794755 once it is running smoothly again we would not be surprised if fire eagle could make good on its promise of becoming the central clearinghouse for location services
3794756 already close to 800 developers are working on applications that make use of fire eagle in some form or another
3794757 while users have full control over their current fire eagle status which only includes their current position and keeps no log the partner services theyve signed up for may continue to display their location history indefinitely
3794758 fire eagle says that as part of the terms of service partner services must agree to let users delete their messages but this will be impossible to enforce ultimately it will be up to users to selectivity give their information to the services they trust
3794759 onto the world championships now and then after that im looking at retiring
3794760 the last few years weve really had to rebuild and at the moment theres a real depth of young talent coming through
3794761 so over the next few years we should look to see a real build up again towards the next olympics
3794762 some world championships its a dead flat course and that suits a sprinter
3794763 some countries are lucky and theyve got enough riders across a broad spectrum
3794764 australian riders tend to be more the short power climbers because thats what we have in our country
3794765 if their aim was to break us down mentally and physically they succeeded
3794766 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3794767 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3794768 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3794769 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3794770 the grand jury said there are billions of dollars being filtered illegal money dirty tainted money that are being filtered through some of the money transaction businesses
3794771 im not sure we have the authority to do this today with regard to these but i think we ought to pass it i think we ought to try it it may be legal it may not be legal
3794772 i recognize that things could have been done better it was always my hope that once that audit is completed it will demonstrate that our office has not acted as recklessly if you will as the miami herald suggests
3794773 someone 50 years old in the system might be like someone 60 outside
3794774 they tend as a group to have smoked more to have used drugs more and to have generally lived higher risk lifestyles
3794775 pack and go that is what they need to do we do not need to keep wasting tax payers money with any more b s of lawyer and time
3794776 pack and go that is what they need to do we do not need to keep wasting tax payers money with any more b s of lawyer and time
3794777 pack and go that is what they need to do we do not need to keep wasting tax payers money with any more b s of lawyer and time
3794778 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3794779 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3794780 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3794781 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3794782 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3794783 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3794784 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3794785 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3794786 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3794787 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3794788 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3794789 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3794790 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3794791 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3794792 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3794793 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3794794 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3794795 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3794796 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3794797 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3794798 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3794799 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3794800 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3794801 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3794802 i think its critical for the integrity of the industry
3794803 its almost hard to believe that the state allowed this to go on for the magnitude that it did
3794804 ample evidence to show that crime in the mortgage lending industry has reached record levels
3794805 you always wish you could do better on certain issues
3794806 we were applying the statutes as effectively as we could
3794807 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone
3794808 you always do a great job i love reading all your stuff
3794809 even with a 10 minute look i can see that the quality of the data is good which tells me the instruments are working we can also see the timing of large cracking events that drain the lakes which stand out as dramatic spikes on the record

3794943 personality is what you are behaviour is what you do and its what you do that makes a difference
3794944 people are actually highly adaptable and far more flexible than personality typing gives them credit for
3794945 take a few minutes and write down the five things you do in your job that have the greatest impact on your performance
3794946 then ask someone who works closely with you and knows you well to write down the five things they see you doing that have the greatest effect on your performance be prepared to hear some things that come as a bit of a surprise
3794947 being a chief executive only says that an individual has the job not that they can do it well
3794948 leadership takes place everywhere once you understand that leadership is about performance improvement getting things done well done better done faster done on time done reliably then you realise that everyone in an organisation has a leadership role to play

3794960 senate democrats began the year suggesting that any state surplus should be spent to help families survive these difficult economic times
3794961 we remain committed to this principle and thats why we want to see the remainder of the budget surplus set aside in an emergency account that will be dedicated to helping families this winter i look forward to working with gov rell and legislative leaders to iron out the details and get this done

3794997 cashing in on the prevailing situation in jammu and kashmir for petty political interests
3794998 whatever be the reason for the ongoing crisis and whoever is responsible we should leave it aside as the time demands political and social leadership to stand up at this crucial juncture set aside personal and party interests and play a matured role of a leader so that the flames of anger revenge and hatred are extinguished
3794999 no one can be happy over the happenings in the state for the past several weeks the administration has miserably failed to deal with this sensitive and critical situation
3795000 i really expect the left to have a bigger role than it has had keeping an eye on the prize which is to remove the massive deprivation of the poorest in india
3795001 left attitude in politics is determined by certain political attitude but sometimes some attitudes are not very pragmatic
3795002 one place where the us government has really got respect is the left they believe that they the us are really powerful and they have to be in awe of them
3795003 the weak stock market has put a bid under treasurys but you still have this overhanging concern about inflation limiting gains

3795007 i am fully with koda and all ministers in the state are also with the chief minister how can we leave him as he is our leader
3795008 who respects the jmm chief more than his soren own son does
3795009 madhu koda government is doing fine and is fighting communal forces well upa government was formed in the state to fight the communal forces we appeal to congress chief sonia gandhi and senior congress leader ahmed patel and rjd chief lalu prasad to ensure that the upa government in the state is not destabilised

3795011 the film has five different stories that are at times interconnected and at times discrete the characters belong to different class gender age and community that represent a cross section of society
3795012 its like a dream come true to direct so many good actors they were very supportive i think being an actor myself i struck a special chord with each of them who have given their best in the film
3795013 i try to be part of stories that need to be told and heard
3795014 i can only say the present aerial search over thick forest growth in the absence of any vigorous ground search is just an eyewash if the government really wants to help us out they should hand over the search operations to the army without losing any time
3795015 but due to rainy weather and dense forests coupled with instructions to the chopper pilots to restrict themselves 1 000 feet above the ground owing to naxal area has made the present search virtually futile

3795017 we expect that kharif foodgrain and oilseed output may be at about the same level as last year while there may be some expansion in the rabi harvest
3795018 what follows from this is that petitioners zee group may be ready to roll out hits platform but the mib is not ready to give permission to broadcasters to provide content to hits licensees
3795019 it is high time that the government immediately takes a decision on this aspect in consumer interest
3795020 both emerging and development markets are down with china and india having dropped the most developed countries by relatively less and commodity exporting countries like south africa brazil russia and soudi arabia the least
3795021 having lost one fifth to one third of their value equity assets would appear to have greater upside rather than down side prospects if there are no major further shocks a slow albeit hesitant recovery may be envisaged
3795022 as various service providers have been given licences in different areas at different periods of time the authority feels that keeping the subscriber base as the criteria for deciding the priority of allotment shall be against the level playing field and the principle of equity

3795077 the fringe benefits of failure and the importance of imagination
3795078 imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation in its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared
3795079 how in the world does this remind her of me
3795080 if you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice if you choose to identify not only with the powerful but with the powerless if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped transform for the better we do not need magic to change the world we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already we have the power to imagine better

3795083 why is mike conaway grandstanding in congress instead of working toward real solutions to high gas prices maybe its because hes taken more than 200 000 from the big oil companies hes been part of a failed energy policy written by big oil in the last eight years weve seen oil profits soar as the price of gasoline has gone from 2 to 4 a gallon big oil keeps running the show getting millions in tax breaks now we have john mccain whos taken more than a million dollars from big oil in the last few months what do mccain and mike conaway want to do next drill offshore thats a gimmick not a solution we wouldnt see a drop of oil from offshore drilling for at least ten years by then who knows where prices will be but mike conaway is more interested in political stunts than honest solutions to rising gas prices tell him to hop out of big oils pocket and to start paying attention to the people who elected him
3795084 is like running ads in detroit against john dingell for supporting the auto industry
3795085 if these groups are hitting conaway then pretty much every republican member of congress can expect a love tap from the left

3795108 i had nowhere to train for the last four weeks my coach gabor salamon is very resourceful and he arranged for me to train with the hungarian modern pentathletes
3795109 it was highly irritating and i thought i could fight through it
3795110 mentally i felt ready i felt prepared and then i just sucked through the last three minutes
3795111 in the beginning i was relaxed and my hits were pure then my shoulder started to tense up and if you just watched the body language she was aggressive and i was tense
3795112 i guess that was the turning point she started taking my blade and i wasnt able to move enough i didnt have the relaxation to get around the blade
3795113 i imagine if i was a man its like getting kicked in the groin repeatedly thats how bad it feels you want to curl up and die
3795114 im trying to put it all into perspective and its tough you train so long and i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody

3795126 after completion of the household chores the women can earn some extra income for their families and afford children s education this has helped them use their time fruitfully
3795127 earlier this place was infested with militants but with the setting up of different factories and development projects the problem of militancy is almost over jobs are available now and youth are no more inclined to join insurgency
3795128 a few years back this place was known as a remote area and it was a home for the militants but now due to these factories which is developed over here it has changed a lot in the villages or in the remote areas people now realize that instead of accepting the weapons if they come over here if they work for their livelihood here there s a far better chance a good chance for their livelihood
3795129 now we try to get to the local police before garrett and lewis i want those two and any information they might have about mr dinkley
3795130 well i can probably interrogate them here im sure aberdeen has adequate facilities
3795131 i want to know when i get them for questioning about the murder of jeff stevens
3795132 stevens i thought they linked laura blacks gun to the scene
3795133 the scene is still the apartment that dinkley had been living in i want to talk to them
3795134 fine i just want to ask them questions for the dinkley case hes long gone by now if hes still alive after that hes all yours ill even give the three of you a ride back to sioux falls
3795135 honestly i think hes dead now remember that patch i found on the back of the medical examiner combine that with the exploding car at your police station and im sure hes gone now some people deal in stolen identities and if they dont get exactly what theyre looking for things can get a bit on the violent side he must have sold some bad papers to someone who needed them and then the someones who fronted the money must have came looking for him
3795136 theres one other possibility but the less said the better
3795137 listen im sorry things went down the way they did its not like youve always been the one stuck in this fashion remember new york or portland or salt lake city
3795138 none of those involved mokoto i know you favor her and her work
3795139 she has been mostly predictable and always accountable she has yet to fail me
3795140 you also keep around j amp j and theyre not exactly precise
3795141 that heavy touch broke my cover i could have gotten a lot more intel
3795142 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3795143 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3795144 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
3795145 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
3795146 one thing he pietersen will definitely bring is his absolute professionalism he pushes himself hard in all aspects of practice and preparation and if he can create that environment for the rest of the team then he should be successful
3795147 im very keen to find owners for these items and so im releasing pictures in the hope that anyone recognising any of the items will call the police

3795158 so there are things that congress can do and we have voted on this over and over again but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that
3795159 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3795160 if we can get some great things in terms of renewable energy resources a renewable electricity standard wind solar biofuels and the rest in that context because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming
3795161 i suspect that speaker pelosi is attempting to push legislation that would only allow for partial access to the outer continental shelf americans may just be better off just letting the current moratorium expire but the real objective is to secure an up or down vote on the american energy act the house gop must accept no substitutions
3795162 in the next election i know that we will strengthen our majorities increase their numbers and we will have a democratic president in the white house and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation energy security and global warming
3795163 the gop has persuaded the public of the wisdom of its fetish for populating the u s coastline with oil rigs
3795164 this is a welcome development with europe standing united against russian aggression
3795165 we now need much firmer british leadership in response to this conflict to back up the efforts of president sarkozy

3795169 children have been stealing scenes in movies as long as there have been scenes to pilfer most capitalize on their inherent cuteness while others can just flat out act
3795170 other young thespians whose adult careers displayed all the dazzle of a spent sparkler include the youngest oscar winner tatum oneal
3795171 clearly most child stars falter when they get older because the cuteness factor disappears others get sidetracked by other pursuits while the rest may have lacked the skill luck proper management or drive to keep their name on the marquee then there are those juveniles who when they reached adulthood simply quit the business or died river phoenix one of the best child actors of his generation died at 23

3795203 estuve ayer en el aut dromo siendo acompa ado por el ingeniero biancalani y realmente me encontr con una obra b rbara con nada que ver a lo que era anteriormente en la d cada de los 80 los trabajos se est n realizando pero depende mucho de los tiempos de ellos y las condiciones clim ticas que nos toquen porque si no llueve no puede crecer el pasto por ejemplo es una obra magn fica y estoy asombrado con las obras que se hicieron con el edificio de cronometraje o el asfaltado de la nueva extensi n pero debemos poner la cabeza en fr o y evaluar todo lo hecho a su debido tiempo si nosotros cuarenta y cinco d as antes vemos que no est n dadas las condiciones pospondremos la fecha para el a o pr ximo porque aqu con el apoyo del gobierno se ha hecho un trabajo impecable y merece estar a la altura de las circunstancias qu alternativas manejamos si hay que cambiar la fecha las mismas de siempre que son hist ricas como paran o balcarce santiago del estero pero primero deberemos ver bien que pasa con chaco no nos gusta mucho esto de cambiar el calendario pero si nos vemos obligados lo haremos sin inconvenientes

3795205 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3795206 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3795207 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3795208 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3795209 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3795210 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama

3795239 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china

3795254 there has been a lot of talk this year and many other years about how tough the nfc east is do you think a lot of this has to do with the talent level of the quarterbacks jason campbell is probably the worst of the four so far and he is a pretty solid young quarterback compare that to every other division where the team with the best quarterback is probably the favorite to win the division the last few years hmmm not sure if the team with the best quarterback in the division is automatically favored carson palmers the best in the afc north and the bengals are the third or fourth best team in that division drew brees is the best in the nfc south and are the saints universally favored this year doubt it but i do think it gives a team the biggest edge it could have at any position group obviously re campbell you will be pleasantly surprised how good he plays this year

3795315 it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured as a result of gully thieves selfishness
3795316 stealing gully gratings is mindless highly dangerous and places greater financial burden on the council tax payer
3795317 there is no reason for anyone to take a gully grating other than stupid high jinks or theft
3795318 whilst it might appear to be a minor problem the gratings must be replaced as quickly as possible and doing this diverts our people from doing core routine jobs and takes money from the public purse leaving less for essential services
3795319 there will be changes for the second game because i want to give all 19 players in the squad as much time on the pitch as possible
3795320 the conditions are demanding on the players out here in bulgaria which will test them the temperature exceeds 90 degrees during match time and the altitude is another factor because were situated 2 000 feet above sea level

3795333 the most important thing for us will be to keep our composure
3795334 they play with his passion with his dignity with his toughness and i have just loads of respect for him when we lost to him we just didnt play well and after the ballgame we could have made all sorts of excuses but i would never not dignify his great accomplishment he is truly a great friend but in saying that i want to turn the tables on him thursday well be ready were going to be a different team than we were then
3795335 weve had to live for two years with people saying we cant defend or we cant do this
3795336 and in that game we learned the finality of what it is if youre not at your best and theres an atonement for that its like a cleansing and as far as our pursuit of the gold medal thats part of the process
3795337 barbosa his whole purpose is to score and spanoulis seems to be more of a setup guard who will score more of a combo but he gets them into the offense quite a bit so itll be a little different
3795338 i will enjoy it you know he is a great player and he will come with his best for me
3795339 if i tell my guys were going to play a certain amount of zone its almost like saying our man to man is not good defense just psychologically
3795340 they may not be good against our man and over the years the championship teams ive had have made teams adjust to them and if youre constantly adjusting to who you play then youve got to be careful you never know who you are but again zone is part of our repertoire and im not saying were not going to use it im just saying i dont know how many minutes well use it
3795341 hes a slashing guy and nobody really talks about him but hes good
3795342 but if hes like carlos delfino a guy who if he makes his first two shots hes on if he misses youve got him
3795343 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
3795344 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
3795345 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
3795346 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them
3795347 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to insure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3795348 personally convey americas unwavering support for the government of georgia
3795349 the united states stands with the democratic government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3795350 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
3795351 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3795352 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3795353 americas reputation here since the cold war is going to hell now

3795360 this experience unfortunately was not good for me because i almost did not play i was quickly injured and i was far away from the pitch for nearly 9 months nevertheless the stay in scotland was enriching for me and my family professionally it was really difficult i could not show my real value and my potential which had me selected in national team in 1999
3795361 narcissus lament having fallen in love as a punishment with his own image in the river styx is one of the highlights a booming baritone capturing the sadness and loneliness of the moment slightly repetitive in places and slow in pace this is not necessarily for everyone but lovers of greek mythology and classical music will more than enjoy the sweeping score and haunting beauty which lie at the heart of this music led theatre piece
3795362 despite its setting in the underworld just out of reach has a strangely soothing effect fear and obsession are tempered by a five piece band and the lilting american voices of the strong cast with emotive song and dance the cast relay mystery and yearning but for us the significance of the piece is just out of reach
3795363 the pittsburgh new music ensemble cant do it all but they can do a lot making their fringe d but the group have produced a show of remarkable versatility that highlights their extraordinary individual talents just out of reach is an aural and a visual delight incorporating mime live score dance and comedy it as an ambitious performance that at times both challenges and enthrals its audience this is an elaborate work that may not be to everyones tastes but even if your existential and classics knowledge is zero the beauty of the music performed here and the sheer quality of the individual performances is utterly convincing if you want a show that is both strikingly original and genuinely entertaining then you could do much worse than just out of reach
3795364 thats going great but relative to other industrial companies that buy a lot of steel they are clearly lagging in terms of their ability to capture price

3795376 we couldnt wait to get into a game and get this thing started were so sick of practice
3795377 we are getting further and further from doing plays and more into doing social events
3795378 we dont think anyone in todays world has the time and patience to watch a beautiful perfect work
3795379 theres an urgency to our work we talk as fast as we can without pausing what we do is pretty simple accessible entertaining political theatre without lecturing we are talking to the climate we are living in
3795380 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3795381 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3795382 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3795383 yes im very surprised i thought if you go you get help if you dont oh well
3795384 specific requirements are in place to assure there is a lessening or even a removal of potential for damage in future storms

3795386 they include elevation and relocation of properties or simple things such as raising hot water heaters washers and dryers among other things
3795387 i stopped by here with 15 of my fellow hikers after a lovely day on schunemunk mountain we were hungry dirty and tired the waitress graciously
3795388 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3795389 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3795390 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3795391 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3795392 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3795393 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3795394 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3795395 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3795396 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3795397 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3795398 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3795399 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3795400 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3795442 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3795443 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3795444 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3795445 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3795446 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3795447 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3795448 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3795449 of what works and what needs correction thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
3795450 we want to continue to help influence this but it is not our position to demand a set dollar amount from sap
3795451 we cant go in there and say were going to demand that prices are only going to be at 17 percent because then were acting as a collective bargaining organization and we dont have the legal right to do that
3795452 share that data among members to establish a baseline and increase transparency of ownership costs as legally permitted segment by industry size region version number you can then figure out the money spent to date and the value realized to date
3795453 i have one question wheres all the talent going to come from and if you could find the talent would they want to be sitting on the support desk
3795454 nobody jumps up and down and says i called sap and got a great answer
3795455 when you get onto sap support desk and tell them that ive always thought they really rallied
3795456 but the people in maintenance mode what are they going to use what are they going to need
3795457 i can tell you we are talking absolutely with the top 10 and 20 in saps maintenance base in terms of dollars
3795458 the question we havent yet answered is will we be in a position to take care of everybody or take a small group of customers initially and then go gangbusters in january 2010
3795459 we dont put people on the road we allow them to live anywhere in the country or outside of it if appropriate
3795460 weve really been able to get people with 10 to 15 years of experience or more i think were going to find the same thing in the sap environment
3795461 customers have shown a preference for wanting support to come from the manufacturer

3795481 as we got going people started coming through to be on it

3795483 it still is a concept album but its taken a little bit of a different turn
3795484 violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent even obsessive theme of culture both high and low it engages the interest of children from an early age as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by grimm andersen and perrault are aware
3795485 to shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic but deforming it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it

3795489 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3795490 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3795491 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3795492 that we could try something else for him i mean he seems so out of it
3795493 i mean were moving to the country in three weeks and i thought if it turns out that jasper just needs more space to burn off that extra energy maybe he doesnt really need the ritalin
3795494 mrs crannitz we could always have jasper take the tests over again but i have to say i dont see any reason to believe that his results will be any different than they were the last time
3795495 but my recommendation is to wait until his eight week evaluation give him time to settle into the new medication it may be that hell need his dose reduced and if he does im sure well catch it
3795496 oh we love it its such a relief to get away from those annoying neighbors
3795497 you know janette you really do tend to run away from things im fine with you moving and i like the idea of the cockapoo business but running away its not healthy
3795498 ive been realizing for a while now that that i have a problem with not facing up to my difficulties
3795499 i feel so funny about this medication theyve put him on
3795500 and what do i tell the school nurse if jaspers pediatrician says to take him off the ritalin
3795501 sweetheart its ok you can have the doctor call the nurse if need be
3795502 you should pop in and see this all the kids have been making an art portfolio this year
3795503 for my masters degree im thinking of doing my thesis on the effect drugs have on creativity i suspect that the creativity gets trapped inside somehow
3795504 just thought youd want to see this before our big art show next month
3795505 hes stopped trying to pull down the other kids pants he eats no more cookies than hes told to hes getting wonderful grades
3795506 jasper makes these in my class too i thought it looked like a storm and i asked him and he said it was hes probably like one of those great landscape artists that focuses on brooks or mountains or something he loves to draw storms
3795507 you dont think its strange that all of the kids on ritalin do the same thing
3795508 mrs cranitz i dont think you have to be so hard on me i spend half my day with your son trying to teach him something
3795509 youd think they could have gotten him to smile for a portrait
3795510 the nurse had warned him that if he took too many he might get sick i think he was trying to show me it was bad by taking it to the extreme not really logical but i get it you know

3795518 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3795519 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3795520 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3795521 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3795522 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3795523 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3795524 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3795525 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3795526 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win

3795531 we drove half a block down the street we saw a bear over this lady and he was chewing on her
3795532 i got out of the van and quickly thought what do i do
3795533 im not sure if the bear grabbed her by the neck in his mouth or by the arm and he dragged her to the front door entrance of the house
3795534 there was blood all over the place there was blood on her driveway and on her steps

3795538 just as important weve inherited an immediate installed base of over 100 product lines and 5 exclusive distributor agreements throughout southern california from which to now channel our sales growth additionally we now maintain floor plan financing with several major financial institution we believe we are now on our way to establishing san west as a significant player within our segment of the recreational off road market
3795539 having worked closely with frank and the san west management team throughout this process over the past several months we firmly believe we are leaving the legacy of the buggy world brand in extremely capable hands as a new shareholder of san west i look forward to the successes which can now be achieved through the convergence of these two organizations

3795629 we evaluated a number of potential fingerprint solutions for this project and found that atrua delivered the superior combination of features and performance for mobile phones
3795630 because of the atrua sensors small size we were able to fit it conveniently on the edge of the p960
3795631 we are pleased to see a recognized leader in fingerprint for laptops adopt our technology for their mobile phone and we are delighted to have the opportunity to support such a leading global manufacturer in their ongoing effort to bring greater levels of security and convenience to users of mobile devices
3795632 we are all a little weird and lifes a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love
3795633 oh thats not such a big deal so and so did that before
3795634 look at him hes degrading our accomplishment how can he say that wah wah wah
3795635 this isnt such a big deal if youll remember jesse jackson won this state back in eighty eight
3795636 that was a regrettable comment from bill and its yet another example of my opponents fondness for rovian politics diversion and denigration and we need move move beyond this stale corrosive behavior in order to focus on the priorities of the american people like universal health care coverage and tax breaks for little kids with cancer
3795637 whoa now lets step back here for a second and look at this
3795638 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3795639 i felt ok i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3795640 i dont partner with anybody but this really was natural for me because ive been a fan from the beginning
3795641 one time i ate right before going on stage and i had to hide my belches from the microphone that was funny
3795642 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3795643 but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning
3795644 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3795645 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3795646 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3795647 i feel for sure ive made 100 the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3795648 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3795649 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3795650 its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3795651 its a great day for the club frank and english football
3795652 he has agreed and signed a new five year contract
3795653 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
3795654 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3795655 this summer has been very difficult personally for me and the club have been fantastic through that
3795656 in the end we got where we all want to be im very happy i have everything i need and always have
3795657 i sat down and realised this club has been great for me and i feel ive been good for the club
3795658 i dont see any squads as strong as us i feel very excited to be part of the future and now hopefully we can win back some titles
3795659 it is highly technical work and takes more than simple logistic transportation

3795669 restore is the trial lawyer bingo that can net jackpot jury awards while wreaking havoc on national standards
3795670 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3795671 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3795672 poor reputation for insensitivity towards racial issues has been further harmed
3795673 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3795674 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3795675 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3795676 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3795677 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3795678 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3795679 for us a few too many mistakes on the synchronized part
3795680 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys at least mistakes like we did
3795681 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3795682 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
3795683 conf an plenamente en la justicia para que se aclare todo lo que ha sucedido

3795685 hay que tener en cuenta otros criterios para saber si su conducta en ese momento era consciente
3795686 nosotros consideramos que l era perfectamente consciente y que act a de esa manera porque quiere causar el m ximo da o a jes s con lo que su conducta es dolosa y no se puede hablar de imprudencia

3795689 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3795694 vaccines are not the cause duh everyone knows its pesticides
3795695 let me take to the cemetery that has all the tiny graves
3795696 botulism is a neurotoxin do you know where you get botulism
3795697 vaccines are bad and evil and you shouldnt use them
3795698 we should look at a possible link between vaccines and autism
3795699 we should check to make sure the substances in vaccines are safe
3795700 oh you know it all astronomer what are you doing commenting out of your field
3795701 question has the thimerosal in vaccines been shown to be harmful to children note thimerosal has been removed from all routinely recommended childhood vaccines except some influenza flu vaccine and tetanus diphtheria td vaccine used in individuals seven years and older
3795702 if this is a non issue why is so much research still being conducted
3795703 that news conference was just drumming up support for john block
3795704 in our opinion a grouping of the anc cannot go to an office of the anc and convene a press conference
3795705 such blatant undermining is highly irresponsible and reinforces and advances a factionalist agenda
3795706 our viewpoint is simply that we are the same leadership collective under the leadership of john block which consolidated around the polokwane product and the leadership of jacob zuma
3795707 the rare privilege to assist to build hegemony between the anc and government
3795708 the premier rather defied the leadership and its mandates time and time again

3795713 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3795714 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3795715 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3795716 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3795717 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year

3795719 i am proud to have helped found the tahoe summit and the health of lake tahoe and its surrounding areas is hugely important to me
3795720 we have accomplished a lot in the past 11 years but we need to continue work on lake clarity and restoration and implementing the environmental improvement program so we can all enjoy lake tahoe for years to come my thanks to all the parties coming to the table to discuss where we are and where we need to go for the future of the lake
3795721 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3795726 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3795727 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3795728 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3795729 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan

3795749 jim puts forward in a very simple way how to grow your army of twitter followers
3795750 es que las autoridades han fijado los precios de los viajes de una hora un camello cuesta treinta libras unos seis d lares y un carro de caballos entre cuarenta y sesenta libras
3795751 no podemos sacar del turista el mismo dinero que le cobr bamos antes stas normas han afectado mucho nuestro trabajo
3795752 s lo podemos trabajar aqu los que tenemos un permiso de las autoridades que nos lo dan despu s de examinar nuestro historial y probar que nunca hemos causado problemas a los turistas
3795753 hiciera una limpieza de los j venes vendedores que molestaban a los turistas
3795754 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3795755 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3795756 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3795757 these are all small things and they all add up
3795758 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3795759 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3795760 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3795761 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3795762 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3795763 ballot access is one of the unknown evils of the american electoral process
3795764 there cant be change by electing a republican or a democrat
3795765 i dont think either of these guys are going to do much
3795766 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3795767 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3795768 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3795769 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3795770 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3795771 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3795772 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3795773 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3795774 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3795775 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3795776 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3795777 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3795778 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3795779 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3795780 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3795781 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3795782 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3795783 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3795784 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3795785 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3795786 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3795787 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3795788 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3795789 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3795790 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

3795797 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3795798 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
3795799 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give

3795803 im really worried because ive got loads of pigs a few cattle and horses and we were getting the pigs ready for slaughter tomorrow
3795804 the utmost priority is to cull the animals to control disease and to put movement control around so that reduces the risk of any further spread
3795805 big browns camps recent remarks about curlin inspired me to offer an incentive to get these two great horses to race at the legendary track at the spa
3795806 both horses are eligible for this race and both have plenty of time to prepare for what would be thoroughbred racing at its very best and in the name of a great cause
3795807 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3795808 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3795809 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3795810 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3795811 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3795812 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3795813 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3795814 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3795815 you have people like me who live in the industrial world and move 700 planes and 80 000 trucks a day what wed like to see is progress and what that requires is compromise
3795816 as wind power capacity rises the lower availability of the wind farms determines the reliability of the system as a whole to an ever increasing extent consequently the greater reliability of traditional power stations becomes increasingly eclipsed as a result the relative contribution of wind power to the guaranteed capacity of our supply system up to the year 2020 will fall continuously to around 4 figure 7 in concrete terms this means that in 2020 with a forecast wind power capacity of over 48 000mw source dena grid study 2 000mw of traditional power production can be replaced by these wind farms
3795817 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else

3795819 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3795820 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3795821 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3795822 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3795823 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3795824 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3795825 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3795826 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3795827 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3795828 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3795829 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that

3795833 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence

3795837 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3795838 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3795839 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3795840 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3795841 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3795842 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3795843 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3795844 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3795845 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3795846 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3795847 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly

3795859 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3795860 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3795861 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3795862 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3795863 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3795864 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases

3795876 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3795877 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3795878 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3795879 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3795880 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3795881 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3795882 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3795883 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3795884 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3795885 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3795886 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3795887 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3795888 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3795889 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3795890 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3795891 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3795892 real results by the end of my first term in office
3795893 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3795894 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3795895 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3795896 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3795897 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3795898 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3795899 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3795900 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3795901 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3795902 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3795903 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3795904 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3795905 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3795906 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3795907 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3795908 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3795909 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3795910 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3795911 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3795912 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3795913 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3795914 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3795915 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3795916 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3795917 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3795918 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3795919 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3795920 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3795921 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3795922 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3795923 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3795924 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3795925 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3795926 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3795927 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3795928 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3795929 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3795930 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3795931 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3795932 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3795933 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3795934 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3795935 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3795936 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived

3795940 we resolutely stand against that the counter terrorism transforms into islamophobia and acquires the form of open or hidden standoff with the islamic world
3795941 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3795942 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3795943 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3795944 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3795945 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3795946 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3795947 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3795948 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3795949 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3795950 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3795951 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3795952 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3795953 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3795954 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3795955 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3795956 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3795957 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3795958 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3795959 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3795960 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3795961 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3795962 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3795963 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3795964 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3795965 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3795966 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3795967 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3795968 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3795969 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3795970 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3795971 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3795972 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3795973 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3795974 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3795975 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3795976 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3795977 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3795978 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3795979 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3795980 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3795981 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3795982 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3795983 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3795984 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3795985 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3795986 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3795987 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3795988 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3795989 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3795990 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3795991 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3795992 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3795993 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3795994 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3795995 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3795996 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3795997 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3795998 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon

3796011 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3796012 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3796022 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
3796023 i knew i could play division i football but i was a basketball fan growing up
3796024 i was good at basketball but i couldnt play at the division i level
3796025 i knew i could play division i football so i decided to go that way
3796026 i didnt realize how good i was until schools started recruiting me i have a passion for football now
3796027 everybody i know is here in the valley all my friends and family can come to the games having the v on our helmet means a lot to our team because most of us are valley kids

3796029 a j was a nice story last year he is a great athlete and an explosive player but he is also the cover boy of everybodys scouting report now he has to work at continuing to improve i am not going to compare a j to devin hester but devin hester is the cover boy and he still returns kicks
3796030 he is as fast as he needs to be returning kicks is an instinctive thing there is a certain amount that you dont coach i just think he has to continue to work hard stay focused and do the little things well
3796031 i have a reputation to uphold as far as kick returns go
3796032 as far as playing corner i am going to come back this year and try and be injury free

3796035 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3796036 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3796037 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3796038 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3796039 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3796040 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3796041 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3796042 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3796043 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3796044 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3796045 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3796046 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3796047 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3796048 there are 10 kinds of people in this world those who know binary and those who do not
3796049 total 10 050 thats 50 for the time and 10 000 for knowing what switch to flip
3796050 so can you tell me what is the ability to define multiple classes with functionally different yet identically named methods or properties that can be used interchangeably by client code at run time
3796051 now can you describe that in terms a manager would understand
3796052 its an action ensemble comedy in the vein of where the casting becomes an event
3796053 lo justo es que la pol tica econ mica sirva a la gente y no que la gente sirva a la pol tica a costa de su econom a
3796054 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3796055 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3796056 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3796057 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3796058 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3796059 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3796060 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3796061 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3796062 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3796063 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3796064 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3796065 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3796066 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3796067 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3796068 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3796069 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3796070 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3796071 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3796072 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3796073 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3796074 industry respected designers elliot jay stocks and bryan veloso are known for their influential creations that think outside the box in this dual presentation theyll be looking at how we can innovate within the confines of the medium and how we can draw inspiration from other media to create bold brave original websites
3796075 cant wait this is a great line up and a subject that clearly requires constant discussion even at typecon this was being treated almost like a new issue when some of us have been figuring out creative ways to work within the technical constraints for 10 years or more
3796076 designers are still complaining about the limitations of web typography is their case valid and will it be in the future what myths are there about web typography and how do we dispel them this panel will discuss overcoming constraints on web to create elegant legible and expressive typography
3796077 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3796078 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up

3796081 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

3796083 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3796084 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3796085 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3796086 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3796087 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3796088 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3796089 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3796090 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3796091 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3796092 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3796093 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3796094 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3796095 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3796096 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3796097 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3796098 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3796099 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3796100 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3796101 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3796102 we have conveyed to the government that we will be launching blackberry service enabled handsets on our network and that we will abide by whatever decision is taken over security related concern
3796103 muchos de ellos vinieron exclusivamente a ver a messi y cuando en el segundo tiempo se dieron cuenta de que no entrar a a jugar empezaron a gritar vamos serbia
3796104 i am extremely proud of our kansas schools and students
3796105 you are my lord i have no good apart from you
3796106 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures
3796107 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is no male and female for you are all one in christ jesus
3796108 what is really bothering my black friends and how can i help
3796109 how can i understand the fundamental issues that effect both of us
3796110 how can i understand our great god from a different perspective
3796111 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3796112 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3796113 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3796114 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3796115 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3796116 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3796117 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3796118 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3796119 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3796120 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3796121 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3796122 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3796123 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3796124 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3796125 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3796126 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3796127 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3796128 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3796129 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3796130 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3796131 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3796132 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3796133 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3796134 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3796135 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3796136 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3796137 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3796138 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3796139 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3796140 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3796141 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3796142 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3796143 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3796144 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3796145 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3796146 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3796147 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3796148 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3796149 the old conservatives have more overlap with the progressives than they do with the neo cons

3796151 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
3796152 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3796153 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3796154 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3796155 there are of course some exaggerated moments during the movie
3796156 but five million people went to see the film it was exported to japan it boosted the popularity of handball in south korea and now we have a large number of fans
3796157 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
3796158 we athletes go through major sacrifices to get to this level it would be the right thing to do to remove the taxes from what we get here it would be a very good thing

3796174 it was wonderful enough to do it in the 100m if i could do it in the 200m it would be a dream come true
3796175 i was thrilled to bits i watched the television all day yesterday and all day today he had two runs today in the first run he had a two second penalty and he had a brilliant second run which is why he did so well
3796176 she was absolutely thrilled and delighted for david hes been receiving his medal and has been talking to gaby roslin and hes been talking to his family
3796177 davids really far too sensible to hope for anything because he knew better than anybody that anything can happen he was focussed and he was thinking positively and he was well prepared hes spent the last four years working towards it i think hell carry on for 2012 but i dont know
3796178 i put in a good final run there and in the pressure of a big final it is the most exciting time to do it
3796179 it was a bit nerve wracking watching the guys follow i was happy i had done a good run and that was all that i could do a medal is what i have been after for the last four years
3796180 this is by far the biggest competition he has ever won he is capable of holding it together under these big conditions

3796202 everything changes and nothing changes cloud computing is nothing new it is just virtualisation stuck on top of grid computing
3796203 the grid was all the rage four to five years ago and virtualisation was all the rage last year and is still strong in the pure commercial sectors
3796204 there is a bit of an overlap with grid computing infrastructures but cloud computing is an infrastructure that sits on top of a datacentre for efficiency
3796205 a grid is a set of machines that you run a programme on the grid is specificially designed for a particular job the cloud is designed to run a larger variety of workloads the cloud can become a confusing amalgam of hardware infrastructure network and software

3796220 a similar lack of understanding of the nhs has led to problems in the past within connecting for health so it is vital that they are brought up to speed quickly and make an effort to win over sceptical clinicians
3796221 both connelly and bellamy are experienced cios and used to running large it projects both will also bring skills from the private sector as is increasingly common for public sector cios neither of them are career civil servants
3796222 i think that most companies lack the skills to add internet collaboration tools to their environments particularly those that have traditionally focused on back end processing rather than front end applications
3796223 they are beginning to hire younger people who have the skills but they still need the corporate blessing to do something with them in the short term they usually hire some geeks from a company that has three people to help develop the applications
3796224 we have seen renewed interest in all things internet as a result of web 2 0 technologies but the kind of training people are asking for is less about understanding the issues and applications involved and more about effective communication and why and what is effective rather than how to do it
3796225 it is a new course area so was always going to be a bit more popular but we have noticed a lot of demand for podcasting which is surprising because it is almost an old technology for web 2 0 though people ask for videocasting as well
3796226 it turns out that in the photo shoot for the submission of our team one of our sponsors asked us to make as a wink to our participation in beijing an expression of eastern eyes we felt it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

3796249 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3796250 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events

3796256 our communities need funding for programs that help provide safe clean drinking water despite a 9 2 billion dollar price tag this bond doesn t deliver
3796257 expectations are that there will be a temporary sales tax some kind of spending cap perhaps like the one recommended by the legislative analysts office and that local governments will take a hit possibly those permitted under proposition 1a that allows local property taxes to be borrowed and requires repayment within two years
3796258 since at least some of these actions require a ballot item on the november ballot the calendar requires action this week
3796259 indeed time is also running out on prop 1 the high speed rail bond and efforts to amend and strengthen it there may be a deal which would place a separate measure prop 1a on the ballot that has these changes

3796282 defendants lawyer at the taking of the plea indicated to the court on behalf of the defendant that mcfaddin was not to blame whatsoever for this accident and that the bottom line cause of the accident was browns consumption of alcohol that evening his plea reflects that he told the sentencing court he accepted sole responsibility for the accident and was willing to take the consequences
3796283 the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving 5 party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law
3796284 summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed
3796285 judicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation
3796286 the purpose or function of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process or the integrity of courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries
3796287 judicial estoppel focuses on the relationship between the litigants and the judicial system
3796288 chameleonic litigants who seek to prevail twice on opposite theories
3796289 a party has formally asserted a certain version of the facts in litigation he cannot later change those facts when the initial version no longer suits him
3796290 because judicial estoppel is an equitable concept depending upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case application of the doctrine is discretionary
3796291 an injustice against the party being estopped while simultaneously subverting the judicial process

3796331 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
3796332 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
3796333 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
3796334 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
3796335 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
3796336 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
3796337 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy
3796338 the project is under progress we do not yet have any timeframe for launch
3796339 do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations theres no point in doing that
3796340 i dont think we should discount this advance if it happens
3796341 one of the concerns of the taskforce is that we havent been able to see enough of lets say the implementation of the security forces
3796342 we need to speak to the players and governing bodies and see if they are in the same position too if they want to see some more

3796353 were making progress but we still have much to do
3796354 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3796355 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3796356 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3796357 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3796358 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3796359 you just have to concentrate on your performance and and always give 100 per cent
3796360 fortunately ernie merrick coach is paid to make the hard decisions and ill just leave it with him
3796361 pressure can always bring out the best you need that kind of pressure every day and now weve got it in every position on the park its really good and hopefully were in a good position going into the first game
3796362 its been really easy to play with him hes just learning the way that we play and there really hasnt been any problems
3796363 weve been linking up well together so its been good
3796364 in terms of style hes probably in the middle of archie and myself hes got a good touch hes strong in the air he can hold the ball and score goals by getting in the right areas he does a lot of unselfish work for the team
3796365 hes been well educated we brought him here last saturday morning and steven king rode him he likes the horse he said hes a lot like his father
3796366 id say hes one of the best horses weve got
3796367 theres obviously a long way to go but theres a lot to like about this horse
3796368 you dont tend to move on until you get a chance to perform again
3796369 it was a good performance by the all blacks and there were elements that we werent proud of or happy with but its not the end its not terminal
3796370 he is quite a positive person and i think its rubbing off on the boys
3796371 it was supposed to be an eight week injury but it has turned into a four week injury with surgery
3796372 i will only miss one game so im pretty fortunate
3796373 a good game would be handy in my last month before i head up there
3796374 im going up there to put in a good performance
3796375 its been a great opportunity being at the titans ive learned a lot
3796376 ive matured as a player ill go up there as a better player and trainer
3796377 we lost 4 million last year and were budgeting to lose 3 million this year
3796378 if it means manly surviving its good to know there is an offer on the table
3796379 i think the game is recognised by all as being under funded centrally so any assistance would be gratefully received
3796380 ne rejettent pas la possibilit de discussion avec laide des europ ens

3796385 we started slow last season and thats one of the things weve addressed
3796386 we drew five out of seven last season and the season before we won seven out of seven its paramount that we start well but its not that easy because every other team will be saying the same thing
3796387 ive completed the last three sessions so ill definitely put my hand up for selection
3796388 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3796389 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3796390 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3796391 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3796392 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3796393 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3796394 our country faces very grave economic military and foreign policy challenges and many americans of all political parties will vote for a change in november barack obama is the only candidate who offers that change of direction we need

3796507 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3796508 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3796509 ask them to try to come up with alternate language
3796510 it may take time for people to get used to singing something different
3796511 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
3796512 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
3796513 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
3796514 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
3796515 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3796516 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning

3796810 in the sense im responsible for this archdiocese i have to accept the blame
3796811 grace is looks like hes trying to explain it away do you read it that way
3796812 despite recent declines the majority of food inputs are still priced above where they were at the end of 2007
3796813 that means food companies looking to hedge these commodities today would end up locking in at higher prices than a year ago
3796814 consumers trading down into at home food consumption is offsetting the negative of consumer price elasticity
3796815 recent problems with wheat streak mosaic high plains virus and triticum mosaic virus in much of western and parts of central kansas remind us of the importance of controlling volunteer wheat well before this year s crop is planted
3796816 in most cases an infection of wheat streak mosaic can be traced to a nearby field of volunteer wheat although there are other hosts such as corn millet and many annual grasses such as yellow foxtail and prairie cupgrass control of volunteer is the main defense against the wheat streak mosaic virus complex
3796817 hessian flies survive over the summer on wheat stubble when the adults emerge they can infest any volunteer wheat that may be present which will keep the hessian fly population alive and going through the upcoming crop season in years with a wet summer and or a long open fall there can be two broods of hessian fly in the fall and this is even more likely where volunteer is allowed to grow and become infested early
3796818 while this insect has wings and can be windborne for hundreds of miles the vast majority of fall infestations in kansas appear to originate from nearby infested volunteer
3796819 during some years infestations become established during late summer and early fall on volunteer wheat later as the quality of the volunteer deteriorates mites move from the volunteer into adjacent fields of planted wheat or other small grains occasionally mites will survive the winter and continue to spread into the planted wheat following greenup in the spring
3796820 where infested volunteer is allowed to grow right up until seedbed preparation just prior to planting early planted continuous wheat is likely to become infested similarly volunteer that is allowed to grow through the fall and into the following spring may also serve as an attractive chinch bug host
3796821 no matter what system is used the stocking rate is key
3796822 when considering the number of cow calf pairs a producer can put on summer pasture it s important to consider the fewest acres a grazing animal needs to meet performance targets plus the animal s performance needs to be balanced with what the pasture requires to maintain a desirable and vigorous plant community
3796823 although continuous grazing has a negative connotation i m not convinced it s all bad
3796824 it can maximize an animal s performance because the animal has the ability to select what it will graze
3796825 in a perfect world 75 to 90 percent rangeland and 10 to 25 percent introduced forages is a good ratio
3796826 sometimes producers wonder if fertilizing native pastureland is a good idea the answer to that is no
3796827 fertilizing tends to promote weed growth and changes the balance of native pasture and weeds in today s economic climate it is certainly not practical
3796828 every time i look at phoebe i know i made the right decision i never wanted to end my babys life just because of how she came to be

3796837 jullie hebben fantastisch werk geleverd jullie hebben veel wederopbouwprojecten gerealiseerd
3796838 er zijn grote offers gebracht ook voor het thuisfront is het zwaar geweest
3796839 ik heb er een dubbel gevoel bij ook hij zou rond deze periode zijn teruggekeerd
3796840 we worden tegenwoordig zelfs door de lokale bevolking op de thee uitgenodigd dat was een half jaar tot een jaar geleden onmogelijk geweest
3796841 het is relatief rustig in uruzgan terwijl in heel afghanistan het geweld toeneemt
3796842 stukje bij beetje winnen we het vertrouwen van de bevolking hierdoor krijgen de taliban steeds minder voet bij grond
3796843 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
3796844 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any real sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan
3796845 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorizing their emplacement across the province
3796846 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
3796847 finding one man intent on remaining hidden within a province measuring more than 22 500km2 is no easy feat
3796848 conducting an operation to capture him without loss of life is even more difficult and the success of this operation speaks volumes for the inherent capability within the sotg
3796849 australias special forces with support from the afghan national army and isaf have refined the process of identifying those in oruzgan who continue to wage their campaign of terror
3796850 the key facilitator in the provision of equipment money and foreign fighters to extremist operations and coordinated the actions of individual insurgent cells
3796851 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
3796852 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorizing their emplacement across the province he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
3796853 there was mullah abdul shukur the taliban governor of kandahar mullah kamran the chief of police mullah baaz mohammad chief of intelligence mullah sayed wali head of the bank mullah qader commander of the air force and mullah mohib commander from spin boldak

3796857 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
3796858 its going good i feel like i have a good grasp of the offense
3796859 i am jelling with the line and with the other backs
3796860 i went through this difficult thing it must be worth it
3796861 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3796862 youve got darkness youve got dust you know pilots under pressure because of potential threats and these accidents will occur and of course are unavoidable
3796863 we dominate the terrain and our active patrolling keeps the taliban well away
3796864 during the month of july only 1 372 households displaced due to the conflict received icrc essential food and non food assistance
3796865 for emergency events such as the indian embassy incident when a bomb killed some 50 people in july
3796866 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure killing eight civilians as well
3796867 taliban militants uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3796868 afghan and coalition forces always use extreme measures to avoid collateral damage
3796869 in this situation the taliban was attacking the afghan and coalition forces from a civilian compound
3796870 unfortunately eight civilians were killed and three wounded who were held by the taliban against their will
3796871 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3796872 on arrival at the site an isaf medevac helicopter was damaged in a hard landing rendering it incapable of completing its casualty evacuation task
3796873 nous ne connaissons personne de ce nom dans nos rangs dans la r gion cest de la propagande il se pourrait quils aient arr t nimporte quel innocent portant ce nom

3796876 served time in jail with al qaeda deputy leader ayman al zawahiri after the assassination of egyptian president anwar sadat in 1981
3796877 he has a massive void to fill and we are confident he will take this club to another height
3796878 we interviewed other coaches but we believe in his ambition and dreams
3796879 he will not lack the necessary support to enable him to achieve his aims and objectives
3796880 he must win the league again and also get us into the group phase of the champions league to earn an additional years contract
3796881 no pueden pretender que se abra un proceso de negociaci n porque evidentemente esa oportunidad la han perdido
3796882 francamente mal la barbaridad que signific la ruptura de la tregua
3796883 entiendo que dentro exista esa corriente que quiz s sea mayoritaria deben entender tambi n que las ocasiones pasan y cuando no se aprovechan se pierden y creo que es muy bueno que se planteen entregar las armas porque es una salida estupenda para una situaci n que ellos mismos han dinamitado
3796884 estamos en una sociedad democr tica una sociedad en la que cualquier idea puede ser defendida por m todos pac ficos a trav s del di logo y en consecuencia esa es la oportunidad que tienen
3796885 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3796886 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3796887 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3796888 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3796889 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3796890 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3796891 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3796892 of what works and what needs correction thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
3796893 we want to continue to help influence this but it is not our position to demand a set dollar amount from sap
3796894 we cant go in there and say were going to demand that prices are only going to be at 17 percent because then were acting as a collective bargaining organisation and we dont have the legal right to do that
3796895 share that data among members to establish a baseline and increase transparency of ownership costs as legally permitted segment by industry size region version number you can then figure out the money spent to date and the value realised to date
3796896 i have one question wheres all the talent going to come from and if you could find the talent would they want to be sitting on the support desk
3796897 nobody jumps up and down and says i called sap and got a great answer
3796898 when you get onto sap support desk and tell them that ive always thought they really rallied
3796899 but the people in maintenance mode what are they going to use what are they going to need
3796900 i can tell you we are talking absolutely with the top 10 and 20 in saps maintenance base in terms of dollars
3796901 the question we havent yet answered is will we be in a position to take care of everybody or take a small group of customers initially and then go gangbusters in january 2010
3796902 we dont put people on the road we allow them to live anywhere in the country or outside of it if appropriate
3796903 weve really been able to get people with 10 to 15 years of experience or more i think were going to find the same thing in the sap environment
3796904 customers have shown a preference for wanting support to come from the manufacturer
3796905 recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership
3796906 this is no surprise at all people believe the company is worth more and that roche can afford to pay more the game of chess has begun
3796907 is confident in the companys strong financial and clinical momentum and its uniquely productive r amp d capabilities which will continue to enhance shareholder value
3796908 there are no russian peacekeeping units or forces supporting them in gori
3796909 despite the assurances from the georgian side that they have ended all military activities
3796910 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3796911 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3796912 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3796913 a century of war anglo american oil politics and the new world order
3796914 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3796915 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a ceasefire
3796916 tis a sweet looking tool isnt it everytime someone gives me their pc to fix i slap that badboy on and let it do its business you would be surprised how many things it finds in peoples machines who use the likes of limewire one machine had over 1500 items main rig amd x2 4400 2gb ddr ram 2x 16x dvd rw 500gb hdd 250gb hdd 2x ati 1300xt gpus 2x 19
3796917 im pleased with the way the players worked together during the pre season matches and having lee shillito and ashley parillon fit again after long lay offs has given us a massive boost in midfield
3796918 we assess that intent to attack the u s homeland remains undiminished
3796919 it doesnt look as if this was premeditated until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
3796920 was forced to start this war by dick cheney to support the campaign of john mccain the only possibility for john mccain to win is to have some kind of war
3796921 dont let your friends in washington democracy promoting institutes or neoconservative think tanks or who are important american newspaper columnists or television talking heads convince you that if you attack russia the united states and nato will rescue you
3796922 dont give guarantees or make threats you cannot carry out
3796923 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgia territory
3796924 i know i speak for every american when i say to him president mikheil saakashvili today we are all georgians
3796925 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
3796926 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
3796927 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
3796928 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
3796929 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
3796930 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
3796931 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3796932 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3796933 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3796934 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
3796935 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders
3796936 we were looking at what kind of threats may arise from development of drugs for therapeutic use
3796937 what if they were used in some unintended way what is the future landscape of the type of threats that could occur and how could you detect these possible threats in the future as new drugs or medical technology become part of our health care
3796938 these may be areas that the intelligence experts would want to keep an eye on
3796939 i think its important for national security that analysts think about what sort of issues may arise in the future as academic and commercial research continues to rapidly expand technology and its abilities
3796940 i think any bloke whos honest about their lives can point to times in their lives when theyve got it wrong
3796941 i know what he would have done if i left he would have partied too thats what i wouldve wanted him to do so thats what i did with some friends
3796942 i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving by with a video camera on the roof filming me either
3796943 in q3 we had an excellent quarter financially bucking seasonal trends
3796944 north america had a very good quarter the financial sector was very strong that we hadnt anticipated and all the verticals were strong
3796945 probably their lack of 8 gig hit them and helped you
3796946 when i talk to end users they are really resonating with our story and our architecture
3796947 at this point in time and for the foreseeable future we have the best switches in the marketplace
3796948 kelly i came across your blog today while searching for yet another endocrinologist nurse practioner for my daughter who was also diagnosed at age 8 i am sitting here at work laughing and will share your site with her as soon as i get home i dont think she will get the rosanna rosannadana part but i know she will love the rest thanks for making the mom of a diabetic teenage girl smile this morning melissa r

3796955 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3796978 it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured as a result of gully thieves selfishness
3796979 stealing gully gratings is mindless highly dangerous and places greater financial burden on the council tax payer
3796980 there is no reason for anyone to take a gully grating other than stupid high jinks or theft
3796981 whilst it might appear to be a minor problem the gratings must be replaced as quickly as possible and doing this diverts our people from doing core routine jobs and takes money from the public purse leaving less for essential services
3796982 im very keen to find owners for these items and so im releasing pictures in the hope that anyone recognising any of the items will call the police
3796983 i think the iraqis are looking for love on the internet because there are no other places for them to meet
3796984 once they have completed their university studies girls tend to stay home
3796985 there were no girls working at the bank and i did not want my mother to find me a wife
3796986 i was overjoyed when i found out that evan was a christian as well
3796987 for security reasons we met only twice and briefly at the tea time cafe in mansur central baghdad
3796988 but i persuaded them that it was the only way to meet a girl
3796989 i had wanted to meet the man of my dreams but how could i when i was always stuck at home
3796990 many young women are unemployed because their parents are afraid to allow them to leave home
3796991 many men have also been victim of violence that has swept iraq and others have simply left the country
3796992 the internet has dethroned in some circles the traditional role of the matchmaker
3796993 we chatted for hours but we waited eight months before seeing each other secretly
3796994 youre out there by yourself against the clock and the strongest rider usually wins i think the americans we have a culture of time trialing we do a lot of these races in america and we have a history of being strong time trialists
3796995 not being in the tour de france really motivated me to prepare as hard as i could it made me very motivated for the olympics and ive got to say its fantastic to get a medal for the united states
3796996 this is what i worked so hard for for so long
3796997 we had a dinner that night and i told somebody that this was easily the greatest day of cycling in my life
3796998 the government stands behind the 2 percent inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target

3797000 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth

3797004 consideram ca sunt necesare aceste precizari avand in vedere ca in ultimul timp au aparut diferite interpretari ale acestor termeni
3797005 consiliul concurentei a transmis presedintelui autoritatii nationale de reglementare in comunicatii si tehnologia informatiei si membrilor comisiei de licitatie rugamintea ca interpretarea dispozitiilor acestui act normativ sa respecte atat scopul pentru care a fost initiat cat si principiile concurentei cuprinse in avizul conform emis de autoritatea de concurenta
3797006 o alta interpretare a acestor termeni ar putea conduce la anularea scopului care a stat la baza adoptarii acestui act normativ si anume promovarea concurentei in sectorul comunicatiilor electronice prin crearea unui nou operator de servicii si retele de comunicatii electronice in acelasi timp s ar crea premisele aparitiei unor discriminari intre agentii economici care detin cel putin o licenta nationala de utilizare a frecventelor radio si care fac parte dintr un grup si cei care detin o licenta asemanatoare dar nu sunt parte a unui grup
3797007 first of all its very possible and likely that people can come to a game and enjoy alcoholic beverages or beer and do it very responsibly what we dont want is there to be abusive behavior that includes foul language that includes disrupting other people who are there to enjoy the game were just saying come and enjoy yourself but dont ruin it for others

3797013 the fact that we lost peoples trust is reflected in the polls and by elections we need to remind people what we stand for and then put the tories on a bit of a run
3797014 i believe the disease has been around for many years unnoticed
3797015 so it is possible that it could be just the tip of the iceberg
3797016 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3797017 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3797018 conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3797019 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard
3797020 if the mekons at this tory thinktank had even bothered to go north of watford theyd discover that these very towns that they want to give up on have experienced a remarkable renaissance under labour
3797021 it would be easy to dismiss this as the work of a bunch of wonkers but its quite clear that
3797022 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3797023 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3797024 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3797025 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3797026 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3797027 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3797028 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3797029 the government has fixed new sanitary conditions for importing beef
3797030 the government will prioritise public health and safety in carrying out its policies
3797031 i dont think we can justify the confusion that takes place in the consumers mind
3797032 as there will no longer be any market for cattle that are too weak to rise or walk on their own
3797033 the u s beef supply is among the safest in the world
3797034 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3797035 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3797036 more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home
3797037 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3797038 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3797039 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3797040 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3797041 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3797042 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3797043 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3797044 although its more like a one two three four punch
3797045 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
3797046 south korea last week agreed to lift restrictions on u s beef and according to one u s government official the country did so on the condition that the u s strengthen its livestock feed rules
3797047 fight tooth and nail against government intervention unless it would help out my buddies

3797049 the appointment as poet in residence with spt is a wonderful opportunity for me to return to glasgow as a fully fledged poet

3797051 im very keen to encourage anyone to take an interest in poetry and writing
3797052 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available

3797057 if we pop up then something happened that was not planned
3797058 its not a question of marketing and publicity we are not a consumer company
3797059 were integrating so many suppliers we have no control over
3797060 you cant use the contract and incentives to motivate people in the same way
3797061 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3797062 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3797063 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
3797064 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate
3797065 the good news is that in a pinch the rba has a big 7 25 percentage points to work with

3797076 there are going to be a whole lot of people working in that area and we want to give them a place to eat and shop
3797077 there werent protectors in the state law that would have protected
3797078 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3797079 the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine
3797080 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

3797106 the nw corner of 17th and south has approved plans for commercial first floor and condos above pretty nice plans from what i remember
3797107 the owner of the lot is from ny and was asking around 1 000 000 for the property which seemed a bit excessive to me and apparently the rest of the market the sw corner of 18th ad south is approved for a walgreens i was under the impression that we would be seeing construction soon but so far no signs of progress

3797110 i joined the network because its a win win situation for both bloggers and advertisers i know the ads placed on my blog will be relevant to my readership the advertisers know that my readers are engaged and interested in their products no one is trying to sell fake pharmaceutical drugs or sketchy weight loss products on my blog
3797111 our placements throughout the network on industry blogs and related sites have given us great exposure to hr professionals looking for information on icims or on talent management technology platforms we look forward to continued success with the program
3797112 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3797113 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them

3797119 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3797120 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3797121 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3797122 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3797123 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3797124 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3797125 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3797126 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3797127 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3797128 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3797129 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3797130 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3797131 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda

3797137 we chose the nabp dmepos accreditation program because we are a pharmacy
3797138 we looked at the processes of the different accrediting bodies in the market and decided that nabp had the most well laid out procedures as we went through the accreditation nabp followed up quickly every step of the way returning phone calls promptly processing our application quickly and approaching us in a professional manner they did exactly what they said they would do and the deadlines they quoted were right on target
3797139 with more than 100 years experience in pharmacy regulation nabp understands the complexities of pharmacy practice and regulation and invites pharmacies seeking dmepos accreditation to apply to the nabp impartial and independent accreditation program
3797140 as the only pharmacy specific organization approved for dmepos accreditation nabp provides pharmacies with a cost effective and straight forward accreditation process that meets cms requirements

3797151 i think bipasha is the sexiest actress in the film industry and for me she will remain the sexiest for another 50 years to come after working with her in bachna ae haseeno i realise why shes often described as bollywoods ultimate sex symbol i cant think of any other girl who deserves the title more than her
3797152 even when i compare the three of them bipasha is still the sexiest
3797153 bachna ae haseeno is an excellent film and i enjoyed the company of all three girls we were comfortable working with each other and i hope that the film will really do well at the box office
3797154 i remember my nervousness when saawariya was released i have the same feeling once again i guess it happens with most actors and since i am a newcomer in the industry i feel even more pressure at the time of a films release
3797155 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3797156 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3797157 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3797158 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3797159 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3797160 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3797161 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3797162 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3797163 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3797164 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3797165 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3797166 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3797167 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3797168 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3797169 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3797170 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3797171 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3797172 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3797173 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3797174 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3797175 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3797176 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3797177 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3797178 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3797179 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3797180 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3797181 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3797182 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3797183 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3797184 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3797185 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3797186 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3797187 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3797188 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3797189 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3797190 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3797191 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3797192 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3797193 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3797194 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3797195 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3797196 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3797197 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3797198 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3797199 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3797200 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3797201 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3797202 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3797203 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3797204 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3797205 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3797206 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3797207 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3797208 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3797209 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3797210 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3797211 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3797212 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3797213 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3797214 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3797215 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3797216 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3797217 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3797218 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3797219 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3797220 who are open to doing something on the production side
3797221 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3797222 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3797223 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3797224 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3797225 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3797226 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3797227 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3797228 have you always wanted to model but dont know where to start maybe you dont know the right people

3797233 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3797234 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3797235 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3797236 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3797237 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3797238 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3797239 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3797240 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3797241 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3797242 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3797243 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3797244 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3797245 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired
3797246 while the book remains a work of fiction it has an underlying reference to emedha philosophy which is a realistic paradigm for it world this unique combination of a new it paradigm being presented through a fictious storyline will make this book an interesting read

3797300 we carry out regular inspections and we take pest control and eradication very seriously
3797301 we do not have a pest problem and the aggressive approach we take whenever concerns are raised prevents this

3797303 such findings are truly revolting how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business trust boards must get a grip
3797304 its pathetic and childish i want a written apology we came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in the police didnt tell us much so i went to the station to ask why they had broken in when i told the desk sergeant i didnt know who they were looking for they just werent interested when i came home i noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged these are for children not for the police to leave a message that theyve raided your house it makes me feel like theyre treating me like some sort of scruff and laughing at me i work for a living we try hard to keep our heads above water with the baby and everything so i dont want to be treated like a scruff who hangs about on the streets all day i dont find it a laughing matter when my two year old son is in bed at night and the door can easily be pulled off
3797305 my son cant play in the back garden and ive written to the chief constable to ask for a new door
3797306 i want a written apology so i can show it to my neighbours i only moved into the street 11 days ago because its a quiet area so ive had to go round to my neighbours and explain im not an idiot or a criminal the back door boarded up makes it look like a crack house

3797308 we know where you live and your families will be told
3797309 drugs and prostitution are the biggest problems in this area and we felt we had to do something about it
3797310 the police can only do so much we spoke to some prostitutes and told them to leave they are not only destroying these communities but putting their own lives at risks we told their punters that we know who they are and that their families will be told
3797311 when we first decided to do this we only expected about 20 people to turn up but when over 100 people turned up we realised the local neighbourhood wants action and is prepared to take on the responsibility we warned people on the streets that we will tell their families if they are seen approaching prostitutes or using drugs and the message to drug dealers is that we will go to the police the local community will find out who they are and they will have nowhere to hide these issues are a growing concern among many families in the area and it isnt getting better there are more young people taking drugs and some are robbing from their own families to fund habits there are concerns that if we drive the drug dealers and prostitutes away from this area they will then go to other areas but i suggest that more groups like ours patrol all different areas of oldham when people realise they have nowhere to go and there is no business for them they may stop we wont just sit here and let the situation get worse

3797382 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3797383 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3797389 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3797390 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3797391 when i showed up there were a lot of people there people on the left and people on the right and then boom i got hit and passed out
3797392 those in the crowd were yelling hey white boys youre in the hood now we were yelling back we dont care we live here
3797393 es absolutamente inaceptable y no tiene parang n en la experiencia de la regi n porque desastres iguales o peores ha habido recientemente en colombia o m xico y ha habido esfuerzos serios y concertados de reconstrucci n que con todos sus problemas han logrado frutos

3797397 foreign vessels are not only poaching our fish but also using our waters as transit for their trade in hard drugs
3797398 90 per cent of all stunted children live in sub saharan africa
3797399 the effects of childhood malnutrition on our human capital base permeate all sectors of the society
3797400 let us identify and establish linkages with other partners and strengthen existing ones bearing in mind quality professionalism and loyalty
3797401 our political ethnic and religious affiliations we must not forget that we are one people with one destiny
3797402 we must avoid the use of abusive language during out campaign
3797403 as we remove the waste that has piled up open access roads and light up the market places to enhance security we shall be promoting the safety and dignity of persons who ply their trade at these market places
3797404 before the end of the year countrywide we intend to support 50 market based organizations with credit facilities so that they could acquire their own haulage vehicles
3797405 we also expect to cover 30 markets and 10 garages in all the regions before the end of this year
3797406 the police are investigating the matter and will soon get to the bottom of the matter
3797407 this will be based on human resource development economic empowerment health good governance and access to quality education
3797408 my strategy under education is to team up with stakeholders to ensure the effective functioning of school management committees smcs intensify supervision and advocate strongly for incentive packages for teachers
3797409 this university will place emphasis on courses that can train people to take advantage of the emerging oil industry in the western region
3797410 a letter to my very anal husband who is asleep in the other room

3797416 common denominator israel at every level is prepared to strike iran
3797417 the crisis in georgia 9 11 and the lessons of gratitude
3797418 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3797419 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3797420 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3797421 we were looking at what kind of threats may arise from development of drugs for therapeutic use
3797422 what if they were used in some unintended way what is the future landscape of the type of threats that could occur and how could you detect these possible threats in the future as new drugs or medical technology become part of our health care
3797423 these may be areas that the intelligence experts would want to keep an eye on
3797424 i think its important for national security that analysts think about what sort of issues may arise in the future as academic and commercial research continues to rapidly expand technology and its abilities
3797425 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3797426 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3797427 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3797428 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
3797429 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders
3797430 and the next thing we know the glass is flying he unlocks the deadbolt and he comes into our house after us
3797431 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea
3797432 it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides
3797433 research has shown that inhaling secondhand smoke is more harmful than actually smoking primarily due to the unfiltered nature of the smoke and its having been cooled by the air
3797434 20 minutes of exposure to tobacco smoke stiffened clogged arteries
3797435 weve coordinated for more than 20 months thats all for this event so we should be focused and concentrate very well this gold is so important to my life

3797441 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3797442 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3797443 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3797444 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3797445 every single tear shed and all the toil in life the emotional battles its all worth it
3797446 la pol tica hace extra os compa eros de cama
3797447 aits growth over the past several months can be attributed to our quality service continued investments in state of the art technology enhanced testing methods and the skills of our highly qualified staff of professionals
3797448 in 2007 ait experienced 80 percent growth in revenues and 170 percent growth in net profits the company has experienced record growth in sales in each of the first seven months of this year
3797449 we are currently on pace to double our 2007 sales
3797450 it is vital for the success of ait to recruit and employ top talent from indiana
3797451 the higher educational institutions in indiana both large and small are producing great talent and ait is providing those graduates with high tech high paying jobs
3797452 this schedule demands the ability of both drivers and teams to master a variety of venues and the challenges each one brings with the end result being a true champion and a driver that is fully prepared to be an indycar series driver
3797453 the opportunity to compete on carb day at indianapolis in front of more than 100 000 fans is an experience that is second to none for our drivers teams and sponsors
3797454 adding two events in canada will also allow us to showcase the future stars of indycar series racing to a new audience
3797455 it will be absolutely fantastic to see the firestone indy lights name back on the streets of long beach where we held our very first firestone indy lights race back in 1991 and in toronto another great venue at which we have a lot of history and as the sole tire supplier to firestone indy lights the diverse schedule presents our engineers the opportunity to provide different tires and technology that are suited to the both the ovals and road street courses we are quite eager to see the 2009 challengers in action in st pete
3797456 its been an amazing recovery for indianas corn crop considering the challenging weather
3797457 this report shows an amazing recovery for the corn crop and we have pulled back from a crisis in food supply and crop availability
3797458 the united states is a major supplier to world markets of food
3797459 when you combine the tight food supplies with the flooding in june we were just right on the edge of not having enough supply and availability
3797460 but compared to what weve been thinking the last three four five months this is a blessing
3797461 the yield numbers for soybeans reflect that the crop is just not very far along and that theres still potential to be had on beans
3797462 typically the crop looks best in june and this year it looked the worst in june
3797463 but with the good weather weve had the last few weeks and a few rain showers it has gotten much better weve even seen a 30 percent drop in prices from the highest point as the weather has gotten better this years 2008 corn crop is priced at 5 40 per bushel
3797464 its still high for the u s average at 5 40 but again we had anticipated higher prices with the flooding we saw a couple of months ago
3797465 thats the bad news prices are lower some producers will wonder why they didnt go ahead and price more of their crop back in june but most producers know that high prices are not good for the livestock producers the consumers and the world trying to feed itself and so this makes them feel good
3797466 while the central indiana real estate market continues to stabilize and even improve in a couple of submarkets home buyers are still in a good position to find an affordably priced house throughout the indianapolis area
3797467 sellers too should be encouraged by the fact that central indiana homes are maintaining their value and buyers are paying on average 95 percent of the sellers asking prices in central indiana
3797468 the recent passage of the housing stimulus bill should help with our real estate market recovery and greatly benefit first time home buyers with the 7 500 tax credit
3797469 we are pleased that borealis and gic si see oncor as a solid long term investment
3797470 this transaction will not affect our employees or the service we provide to more than 7 million texas consumers our dedicated employees will continue to provide superior reliability while deploying one of the most advanced utility technology platforms in the country
3797471 the upgrade is a strong vote of confidence by an independent voice of the structure that was put in place to ring fence oncor from the obligations of efh and its subsidiaries
3797472 a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer
3797473 pride comes before a fall and cameron shadow chancellor george osborne and the rest of the tory brideshead set may believe they were born to rule but it is foolhardy to show even a glimpse of smugness in public a general election is up to 21 months away thats 89 of harold wilsons long unpredictable and potentially fatal weeks in politics
3797474 the industry is facing the possibility of a serious threat caused by a combination of rising costs and the economic downturn that could result in delays and at worst cancellation of some of these schemes
3797475 no one predicted inflation at these levels and some projects may have to be scaled back
3797476 there are already arguments about who will pay for major infrastructure work such as crossrail and those debates are likely to increase as budgets climb
3797477 have you ever wanted to know what it takes to promote your own work

3797487 worsening human rights situation and an overall deterioration of services infrastructure and shelter
3797488 in coming years the political role of the united nations in iraq will grow
3797489 support for president saakashvili is now a matter of principle for the majority in georgia as we face a military aggression from russia
3797490 but when this nightmare and tragedy is over many of these people will start asking questions people understand that saakashvili made a mistake by not thinking about the consequences
3797491 it would have been better not to start this war in the first place but to seek a political solution
3797492 a lot of young people are dead now wheres the sense in this
3797493 it was a very well planned trap which we walked into
3797494 but saakashvilis political future will depend on how hard the west will push russia
3797495 it wont be easy to get the russians out of here he should have thought about that
3797496 another sign of the times prime borrowers are defaulting on their home loans at increasingly high rates
3797497 wamu reports similarly disturbing losses and it is clear that this latest trend is doing nothing to help the already struggling housing sector on the road to recovery

3797506 we do not offer advice and we do not coordinate with private homeowners regarding the renting of their houses
3797507 i dont know that wed be in a position to give advice
3797508 people are less likely to take a gamble on a place on the internet rather than dealing with somebody they have a face to face relationship with
3797509 and our clients love to deal with an organization that has strong local ties here and have everything taken care of under one roof

3797526 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
3797527 whatever the outcome the fortunately relatively small scale war over south ossetia has highlighted the present unsatisfactory situation between russia and what one still has to call the west
3797528 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3797529 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here

3797531 talk about lyrically is a song i wrote with my good friend derek sperry over the course of about 40 to 50 hours
3797532 the song is a detailed account of the disagreement between two very intertwined and opposing existences it deals heavily with the isolation bitterness and occasional violence felt in something as simple as an argument or difference in opinion
3797533 we just wanted to come up with the most ridiculous and exaggerated metaphors of some lowly human interaction

3797540 this tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within the musical growth of this band cannot even be charted they are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry
3797541 the secret of staying young is to live honestly eat slowly and lie about your age
3797542 well she didnt look good in that cause it made her look a lil bit big
3797543 she told me lauren i would just be very careful
3797544 she was huggin on them trying to get them to talk to her
3797545 i just kind of got a bad feeling i was nervous and i told jim that it was kind of like i was taking kelleys place the kids wanted to be with me more than they wanted to be with her
3797546 if they messed up but look really great let them through

3797549 zero jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote he actually said that and we were like wow its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here
3797550 hes of questionable sexuality at least as a slug they tell me that these slugs can be either male or female depending thats something i guess that slugs and snails do i wasnt aware of that but i have continuity experts that tell me these things
3797551 this place will be full of pounding rap music atmospheric haze and ominous darkness
3797552 it will basically be like walking into an abercrombie amp fitch only more so

3797554 it has all the heart pounding excitement of being lost at night in a bad neighborhood only more so

3797560 when you worked the opry they wanted you back on saturday night
3797561 i thought about it but seems like things worked out that i didnt
3797562 it brings memories of when i was a trustful wife
3797563 she was a soft spoken modest nonthreatening performer and yet that was what it took in the early 50s for a woman to gain that acceptance
3797564 most of the time i just make fun of me which is easy

3797573 people use superlatives and get real excited and thats awesome but i dont think were the greatest live band in the universe i know better than that
3797574 we feel a lot of give back from the crowd which makes the energy go up in a natural way rather than it all coming from us
3797575 honestly its a little bit easier to do a long show when you feel like you dont have to go out there and kill yourself
3797576 its definitely a worrisome thing trying to keep your stamina together its a matter of pacing yourself a juggling act to try to figure out all these factors but at the same time not get too cerebral
3797577 honestly i look forward to playing a longer show than a half hour set at a festival we just dont even feel like we can get started you get going and its over
3797578 i have trouble listening to a band for more than an hour or two so im sensitive to that
3797579 you dont want to keep playing for the sake of playing

3797588 various of our companies had rented out the darkhorse on consecutive weekends so we simply decided to package the plays as a group effort but now we have a movement a collective celebrating what is good about african american theater
3797589 michael walkers plays tend to have historical value about the black experience plus more poetry and music
3797590 but the other pieces were producing have a comedic aspect and feature characters that are often aspiring or upwardly mobile poverty and anger have to be addressed but so do relationships family and friends and weve been getting enthusiastic feedback on the contemporary shows
3797591 were growing naturally weve got more events and we know that audiences want to see the african american experience portrayed on a more relatable day to day basis
3797592 and weve been seeing a spike in our attendance among non blacks with recent productions like 70 club and topdog underdog

3797623 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
3797624 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
3797625 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
3797626 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
3797627 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
3797628 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
3797629 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
3797630 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
3797631 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead
3797632 aparentemente es un virus que se encuentra dentro de su cuerpo y que se ha acentuado debido al calor sufrido durante el primer d a de trabajo el contraer tal virus parece ser una posibilidad en un mill n
3797633 voy partido a partido y cada uno de ellos es complicado y muy importante porque aparte de por m estoy jugando por mi pa s y eso es una motivaci n extra por eso cuanto m s lejos llegue mejor aunque no logre medalla por eso estoy feliz por haber alcanzado los cuartos de final
3797634 about 30 years ago when i was a newly minted preacher more full of myself than with the spirit my dad sent me a letter written in longhand script in which he basically said
3797635 packed with practical insight and direction for ministry written in a warm and fatherly tone
3797636 i remind you to fan into flame the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands
3797637 when we mentor a timothy we do something that has eternal significance my dad poured his experience into me handing me the tools of faith in my life i have mentored some who are now passing the faith along to those they know and that is something that pleases my heavenly father and changes destinies
3797638 ive kind of been struggling but i took a lesson a couple of days ago with carmello benassi i went through a swing change and its helping me a lot i hit it a lot better today
3797639 it meant a lot to me to win this tournament again
3797640 im coming along ive struggled but its starting to come together slowly but surely
3797641 our goal was to break 290 thats always our goal up here but it was a hectic day with a shotgun start and trying to get done before dark
3797642 and i think thats why jared won hes a young man with a calm demeanor he never goes too far in either direction hes level headed cool about things and on a day like today with people rushing he made a lot of pars and was just being steady
3797643 hes a great example to our younger players of mental preparedness and a good positive attitude
3797644 one of our goals is to win our own tournament the flyer classic win the frankfort cup win the gene hilen cup and then we start thinking about the conference the region and state
3797645 the hilen cup is very very important to our program and im sure it is to the other two schools because of what mr hilen meant to junior golf
3797646 we definitely want to respect his memory with honor and integrity and a good competitive effort and in the 11 years ive been coaching this program i think the kids have always done that
3797647 we were doing wide receiver versus defensive backs one on one and it happened while i was doing a route
3797648 its just a little tight says uk offensive coordinator joker phillips of fields hamstring
3797649 i dont think he tore it its just tight and tender aggravated
3797650 the hamstring is a tough call we just hope we can get him back on the field soon so we can see if he can help us this year the longer hes out the tougher thats going to be hopefully he can get healthy enough to come back and see if he can compete for us at some point in time this season
3797651 in track it kept me out a couple of weeks
3797652 but track is a whole different thing than football at least sprint wise i dont think you ever run as fast in football as you do in track
3797653 i felt like everything was good because it was in the middle of practice we had already done a lot of stuff so i felt like everything was fine
3797654 better it must have been really something over the weekend make no mistake about it this is a big blow for fields mentally
3797655 im in rehab right now just trying to strengthen it back up im taking it day to day it is feeling better now but its hard to tell hamstrings can fool you theyll make you think youre ready when youre really not so now im just pretty much watching from the sidelines and learning
3797656 hes doing well in the football classroom in picking up stuff
3797657 but thats a little bit different from the field it happens a lot faster here on the football field so hopefully hes got a good grasp of it the offense and can get caught up to speed on the field so we can make a determination on whether he can help us this year or not
3797658 as time goes by well see but im not really thinking about it right now
3797659 five days after the initial start of preseason practice heading into the opener aug 31 at louisville 3 30 p m on espn
3797660 the thing you dont realize is how big he is how big and fast we have fast guys and we have big guys but we dont have anybody big and fast like he is thats the thing you dont realize until you see him out here in uniform
3797661 i just have to i dont know be patient and take it day to day

3797666 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year

3797668 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue bushs ratings are terrible but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead

3797671 the dominant image of atheism blogger pz myers wearing a scarlet letter

3797673 consumption of premium internet video content to date has been low
3797674 services have been available only on less than optimal screens pcs and portable multimedia players but new connected products that link to premium internet video services are emerging at a rapid pace moving the internet video viewing experience into the living room
3797675 allow me to be among the first to call bullshit
3797676 veteran bigfoot tracker tom biscardi said hes examined the body and that scientists will get their chance soon
3797677 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3797678 it was a great show and i hope we have many more
3797679 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3797680 the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3797681 i dont know how to better represent them than to sit here with a gold medal in my hand
3797682 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go
3797683 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

3797686 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3797687 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3797688 i think the iraqis are looking for love on the internet because there are no other places for them to meet
3797689 once they have completed their university studies girls tend to stay home
3797690 there were no girls working at the bank and i did not want my mother to find me a wife
3797691 i was overjoyed when i found out that evan was a christian as well
3797692 for security reasons we met only twice and briefly at the tea time cafe in mansur central baghdad
3797693 but i persuaded them that it was the only way to meet a girl
3797694 i had wanted to meet the man of my dreams but how could i when i was always stuck at home
3797695 many young women are unemployed because their parents are afraid to allow them to leave home
3797696 many men have also been victim of violence that has swept iraq and others have simply left the country
3797697 the internet has dethroned in some circles the traditional role of the matchmaker
3797698 we chatted for hours but we waited eight months before seeing each other secretly
3797699 i tried on three separate occasions to set up an appointment to see her parents but they turned me down they think that the internet is not a good way to get to know each other but i will not give up
3797700 social dialogue between the west and north korea is very limited
3797701 the invitation means that pyongyang is beginning to have non political talks with western society
3797702 well you know it was very interesting because at first i thought im not happy with the way the chinese are treating the tibetans because i dont think anyone should be unkind to anyone else
3797703 for the families who have lost their loved ones or lost limbs or suffered severe injuries your statement and act has caused extreme emotional distress
3797704 if you want to see my husband pound the hottest bitches in porn log onto rockstarpimp com dont go anywhere else
3797705 why i am doing this because i can its pure excess rubbing it in the face of the world that im getting away with this
3797706 regular guys who are married everywhere might say that guys living the dream i know if i was stuck in a situation where i wasnt happy fantasy would be the release whether its dungeons amp dragons or sports or porn
3797707 were closing in on 90 something scenes exclusively for the site and weve already cut the first 11 or 12 dvds
3797708 the way im going about marketing it is totally different we think this is a different kind of consumer i think if people are fans of the website itll be branded as rock star pimp presents on the dvd side we didnt want to be too broad and too general alienating the niche consumer who knows what they want thats why weve broken it up into genres tera actually came up with the name shes my smoking hot wife and im always saying this is smoking hot or that is smoking hot i think weve got 10 different genres so far
3797709 were even doing contests so members can vote for any girl they want to see next
3797710 what really sets this apart from everything else on the web everything in the reality niche is that unlike all these other reality sites everyone in the industry knows that its all fake
3797711 with all of the heavy hitters and all of the programs that are out there its contrived reality its like when you watch reality tv
3797712 it does pay homage to the ogs of porn kind of like a show it gives respect to guys like randy west ed powers and john stagliano
3797713 we film the same hot nasty sex and present it in a different light the gimmick is that less is more
3797714 whats up this is evan seinfeld my guest this week is audrey bitoni shell be here any minute and well find out a little bit about her fuck her every way we can and then shes going to be on the receiving end of a massive money shot
3797715 i dont care if anyone thinks im a great performer or not a great performer or if i have the biggest dick or not the biggest dick im very confident in my sexuality and im doing it
3797716 i imagine that there will be copycat sites thats cool it doesnt matter what anyone else does i know what im doing and im enjoying it
3797717 happier learn the secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfillment
3797718 a brain tumor the best thing that ever happened to me
3797719 i quit watching the news on tv in the morning i prefer reading the news on your website why start the day with negative information when you can start it with positive information it really has improved my attitude towards everyday life im in a good mood after reading the news on your website everyday people need to learn to focus on the postive rather than the negative theres so much good in this world
3797720 thank you for writing your newsletter some good news i enjoyed reading the positive stories i am heartened by thegoodness and generosity that i see in people keep up your good work
3797721 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site
3797722 when i get to work in the morning iget my coffee jump online and read the news every day i went home sadand depressed then i found your site and after reading the first storyi immediately felt my spirits lift i never went home sad again reading ordinary news gives us a sense that thats all there is butyour site reminds us that there is more and the world is not as bad asthe news would lead us to believe thank you for everything

3797724 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3797725 quick we need another headline about sex to distract the proletariate while we continue to f ck the rule of law and representative government
3797726 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
3797727 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
3797728 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
3797729 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
3797730 this gets at the stability of the framework the us thought was going to govern the post cold war world
3797731 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3797732 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3797736 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3797737 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3797738 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3797739 i wish you well in your strugles or i wish it goes well with you
3797740 i think they thought heres a different voice its different there are people who connect with it and we love this voice it sounds different nobodys voice sounds like stephen as so for better or worse depending on your point of view that was his calling card
3797741 i know there are some great bloggers but how do we know what that blogger knows of course im giving you the cynicism of people who have cut their teeth in this business and had to sort of pass an exam every day for years and years and years when readers would ask how do you know this
3797742 reading habits are very difficult to form and even more difficult to break wed like to think weve built up some trust so before i believe this blogger this persons got to build up some trust again youre getting this point of view from someone 49 years old
3797743 when its in good fun im not that serious a guy when it isnt im real serious when it becomes admonishing and sanctimonious then i come back with fire and brimstone thats the way i combat stuff when these things are treated as they should be in my opinion which is with some sense that it is hilarious and some context then it is what it is but when people get sanctimonious i come out swinging
3797744 i wear shorts starting the moment i come home from the nba finals i wear shorts virtually everyday virtually so lets say 95 of the time until labor day or so probably late september when the temperature gets back in the 70s thats what ive do ive done it for seven years im going to continue to do it i told pti dont put the camera done there then we dont need to see my legs
3797745 theyre adult film star oh boy what reaction should i have had other than its funny people who would suggest i would have another reaction you know i would love for somebody to say that to my face
3797746 if you come at me with sanctimony i will verbally try to cut you deep

3797771 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3797772 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3797773 the deleterious effect of video games gets more press coverage than beer so it makes sense to me also most parents havent played gta but most have had a beer so they are less concerned about the devil they know than about the devil they dont know
3797774 sounds like a lot of parents believing what theyre told by the media about these games rather than having a look for themselves and realizing the sex and violence elements are blown out of all proportion
3797775 we specifically chose the game because it has emerged over the history of games as the most controversial of games out there it is a game clearly marked mature but there are still parents out there who dont understand that and their kids are playing it
3797776 its been interesting the conversation that the press release has sparked its certainly one of the intentions for us we want to create dialog amongst parents we certainly didnt set out to be hyperbolic about it we just simply wanted to report some of the findings we had in our community
3797777 instead of asking the question in the most basic terms we put a little bit of twist to it we asked our question in a more interesting way in the case of the second poll it was done the same way

3797782 gm researcher jihui yang said a metal plated device that surrounds an exhaust pipe could increase fuel economy in a chevrolet suburban by about 5 percent a 1 mile per gallon improvement that would be even greater in a smaller vehicle
3797783 in an internal combustion engine only about a quarter of the total energy from gasoline is used to actually turn the wheels while 40 percent is lost in exhaust heat and 30 percent is lost through cooling the engine that means about 70 percent of the available energy is wasted said gm

3797809 anyone who is serious about people being free to express themselves with their votes wants a secret ballot the problem for labor unions is that workers in the private sector increasingly vote against being represented by unions the proportion of workers in the private sector who are represented by unions has fallen below 10 percent since unions are losing the game under the current rules their obvious answer is to change the rules specifically they want to do away with secret ballots when the government conducts elections to determine whether the workers in a particular company or industry want to be represented by a union with labor unions being major supporters of the democratic party spending hundreds of millions of dollars in this years election campaign it is hardly surprising that congressional democrats have lined up solidly behind legislation to let union organizers simply collect signed cards from a majority of workers in order to be certified as the officially recognized union for those workers of course the union organizers will then know who did and who did not vote for them and they may have long memories or short fuses or both moreover the workers themselves know that so they may find it prudent to sign up for a union whether they want one or not
3797810 this legislation passed the house of representatives last year but did not make it through the senate i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states barack obama has said to the afl cio senator obama has also said many times that he is against special interests but like most politicians who say that he means that he is against other politicians special interests his own special interests are never called special interests neither are the environmental extremists who support the democrats called special interests but the green zealots who have for decades blocked the country from using oil within our own borders more oil than in saudi arabia by the way are also among the special interests with a big voice in the democratic party they are also a major factor in shutting down the democratic voting process in this case in the house of representatives where speaker nancy pelosi refuses to allow a vote on drilling for oil in places where the green zealots dont want drilling the congressional democrats could of course vote to continue forbidding drilling in those places but voters paying 4 a gallon for gas are not likely to agree with the green zealots and recent polls show that they do not rather than lose votes in the november elections by voting with the green zealots or lose the money that the green zealots contribute to the democratic party coffers nancy pelosi simply shut down the house of representatives so that there could be no votes and turned off the lights so that c span could not broadcast republicans speeches protesting what happened after all what is democracy compared to support from the green zealots
3797811 it is the same story when it comes to the teachers unions the biggest special interest of all in the democratic party they not only contribute money they can contribute people who walk the precincts on election nights rounding up the faithful to go vote even the congressional black caucus dares not vote for vouchers or any other form of school choice that the teachers unions oppose better to let a whole generation of black children be trapped in failing schools that employ union teachers

3797813 h e was also assured by project manager at the national works agency linval ramdial that with proper river training water should not be able to wash out the structure this river training henry later said was ongoing work which should continue into the next couple of months
3797814 most people know the tragic state of black education today we know that billions of dollars are spent on federal government programs such as no child left behind and the billions spent by state and local governments if you were to ask an education expert to explain the tragedy youd get answers such as racial discrimination and underfunding my colleague dr thomas sowell has written volumes on black education and an article worth reading is one he wrote some years ago in the public interest spring 1976 and reprinted in his book education assumptions versus history washingtons paul laurence dunbar senior high school is one black school that sowell writes about from 1870 to 1955 most of dunbars graduates went off to college earning degrees from harvard princeton williams wesleyan and others as early as 1899 dunbar students had higher scores on citywide tests than students at any of the districts white schools dunbars attendance records were generally better than those of white schools and its rate of tardiness was lower latin was taught throughout the period from 1870 to 1955 and in the early decades greek was taught as well large classes were the norm 40 students per teacher it was more than 40 years before dunbar had a lunchroom which was then so small that many children had to eat lunch on the street blackboards were old and cracked it was 1950 before the school had a public address system most of the parents of dunbar students worked in unskilled and semiskilled occupations white collar and professional parents totaled 17 percent sowell also writes about baltimores frederick douglass high school whose education tragedy was featured last june in the hbo documentary hard times at douglass high and my column black education july 23 2008 frederick douglass was founded in 1883 as the colored high and training school before it was renamed in 1892 it survived for decades with inadequate support located in a succession of hand me down buildings that whites had discarded old textbooks used years before by white students refinished desks from white schools secondhand sports equipment and so on teaching styles at douglass approximated those of rigorous colleges discussion rather than lectures reading lists rather than day to day assignments and papers rather than reliance on objective tests the interest of teachers in the students was reciprocated by the parents according to alumni the school could do no wrong in the eyes of parents douglass produced distinguished alumni such as thurgood marshall and cab calloway as well as several judges congressmen and civil rights leaders douglass high was second in the nation in black ph d s among its alumni dunbar highs distinguished alumni included u s sen ed brooke and physician charles drew
3797815 these successful black schools and others contradict what the experts say is needed to improve black education todays dunbar and douglass high schools teachers and students have resources that would have been the envy of their predecessors class sizes today are a fourth of what they were yesteryear what about the argument that segregated schools as in brown v board of education are inherently unequal or as argued in serrano v priest that equalization of expenditures per student is essential for equal education these observations are not arguments for segregation or unequal school financing they merely challenge assumptions that have become gospel
3797816 former teachers and alumni whom sowell interviewed said that the most basic characteristic of their school was law and order respect was the term most used to describe the attitudes of students and parents toward the schools the teacher was always right was a frequently used phrase without a civilized learning environment academic excellence is impossible no matter how much money is spent
3797817 thats the way we have funded school construction in the past
3797818 i would expect that would be part of the discussion what level of funding can we provide for school construction and can we afford to do it with a bond

3797820 nothing has changed the football operation is the same as it was when i first signed as manager of the club and were looking ahead to an important uefa cup game
3797821 there have been misunderstandings in any organisation if you make big changes which there have been at the club both on the football side and the business side then until those areas understand how they work in relation to each other then on occasions messages will be misinterpreted
3797822 its been a difficult week in many respects but its happened fairly early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better
3797823 there were circumstances that needed to be understood and learnt from but thats happened and its not an issue from my point of view
3797824 their futures are here theres been a lot of speculation and there always will be about good players
3797825 ive made my views very clear to everybody that those two players wont be leaving
3797826 ive been reassured of my position i think people are concerned that maybe funds wont be available for me to bring good players to the club but thats not the case
3797827 it is likely darius will not be available for something like 10 weeks
3797828 he will be in a brace for six weeks and then will need another month to build up his fitness
3797829 it is a very strong squad and its a sign of our intent for the season coming up not just for the under 21s but the seniors as well
3797830 fraizer campbell is a player that the hull fans will know well and he was a massive part of hull getting into the premier league
3797831 the fact he has been around the manchester united squad in pre season shows he is progressing and he showed an excellent attitude when he was involved in the under 21s at the end of last season
3797832 newcastle united midfielder joey barton has admitted a charge of violent conduct and requested a personal hearing
3797833 the charge relates to an incident involving bartons then manchester city team mate ousmane dabo at citys carrington training ground on 1 may 2007
3797834 there are some young fellas but theres still quite a few guys whove played over 50 caps here
3797835 its up to all of us to make sure that the guys who havent been here before are relaxed and understand what theyre in for and that well help them out
3797836 i think the best way to lead is to get out there and get your performance right and thats what the senior players have got to do
3797837 its always tough watching the first couple of games from the sidelines but it all blacks tri nations results could have been worse too
3797838 i think for this all black team having had two wins and two losses this is a game that we really have to put a performance together
3797839 about one fourth of all known fish populations are already overfished to the brink of extinction including once abundant species cod and tuna
3797840 according to the united nations food and agricultural organization fao another 50 percent are considered completely exploited
3797841 the number of players is decreasing but those that remain are getting bigger more global and more powerful
3797842 stupid american healthcare and damned hmos just know that the best people in all of this have been the people at blue shield
3797843 la singularidad de la crisis en alicante es responsabilidad directa de camps
3797844 las mentiras sistem ticas del consell y la burla permanente a los ciudadanos que esperan una vivienda digna para acabar en un sorteo de apenas 400 pisos del ivvsa al a o
3797845 en lo que llevamos de a o el ivvsa ha sorteado un total de 322 inmuebles protegidos en la provincia de alicante de los cuales 40 corresponden a adjudicaciones en r gimen de alquiler en la provincia de valencia las viviendas protegidas sorteadas ascienden a 79 todas ellas en r gimen de compraventa y ninguna en castell n
3797846 un insulto a la inteligencia de los ciudadanos las afirmaciones de camps y la manipulaci n sistem tica de canal 9 cuando la realidad es que no llegaremos a las 400 viviendas realizadas por sorteo y las miles de viviendas prometidas no existen
3797847 por jugar con sus derechos y mentir en las cifras
3797848 si hiciera lo que dice el impacto habr a sido infinitamente menor
3797849 el consell ha disminuido un 42 las obras publicas en la comunitat valenciana en el primer semestre de 2008 frente al incremento de las inversiones del gobierno de zapatero
3797850 ni hay viviendas protegidas ni inversiones en los servicios p blicos que sufren un grave deterioro en la sanidad y la educaci n mientras rambla se pasea por el circuito de formula 1 y camps act a como el guadiana aparece y desaparece
3797851 de agravar la crisis econ mica por su pol tica de endeudamiento hist rico y que difiere en el pago a las futuras generaciones con m s de 11 000 millones de euros que hipoteca a los valencianos en los pr ximos 30 a os mientras se gasta en lo superfluo y el apoyo al sistema productivo es nulo
3797852 camps ha creado un red de fundaciones casi una treintena que incrementan el descontrol en el gasto p blico mientras en la sanidad las facturas en el caj n por pagar superan los 1 200 millones de euros por no hablar de la insolvencia del ente de televisi n al servicio del pp y que nos cuesta m s de 1 100 millones en p rdidas acumuladas
3797853 con m s de un mill n de euros para propaganda y contrataciones a dedo as como la reducci n de cargos pub licos que en la actualidad son el doble que frente a la etapa de zaplana
3797854 frente a ocho a os sin un euro y ni una gota de agua con el gobierno de aznar
3797855 los valencianos tendremos solucionado el problema h drico en 2010 con las desaladoras y modernizaci n de regad os pero vamos a garantizar aportaciones externas all donde haya garant as de suministro y no como ocurre con el ebro dado los prolongados periodos de sequia que sufren los r os de la cuenca mediterr nea frente a los caudales vertidos en el litoral atl ntico
3797856 un trasvase derogado que hipotecar a el crecimiento futuro de la comunidad dada la falta de garant as de suministro
3797857 asuma su responsabilidad en la crisis que golpea a la econom a valenciana
3797858 camps no puede mirar a otro cuando lidera el paro la destrucci n de empresas la morosidad y el endeudamiento en espa a y sin embargo sigue en su pol tica de no hacer nada y trata de eludir su responsabilidad directa distrayendo la atenci n con falsedades
3797859 la singularidad de la crisis en alicante es responsabilidad directa de camps
3797860 camps elude su responsabilidad en la crisis y bancarrota del consell prometiendo vivienda que no hace y trasvases imposibles
3797861 la singularidad de la crisis en alicante es responsabilidad directa de camps
3797862 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3797863 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee
3797864 everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3797865 i dont know what the doctors are going to tell me about playing golf down the road
3797866 as a two time defending pga champion it was a lot more frustrating not to be competing and that hurts the most
3797867 the thing i miss the most about not competing is the fight ive gone through this experience before so i knew what i was in for
3797868 id be surprised if nick went for monty though from what ive heard wild cards go to players in form and paul mcginley told me that the last thing you want is to go to a ryder cup playing badly
3797869 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing
3797870 its hard to criticise them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here
3797871 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
3797872 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl
3797873 at the same time the transaction represents a good return for our shareholders many of whom are our employees
3797874 we believe talecris has demonstrated a track record of the utmost integrity and ethics and has some of the most widely used life enhancing plasma derived therapies available
3797875 patients count on talecris to provide them with the therapies they need we are committed to growing and enhancing the business to the benefit of all stakeholders
3797876 you can continue to torment yourself over what you saw or you can recognize that you only can work at the ability that you have
3797877 significa la vida la carrera y la calidad de cada uno
3797878 its good to see that we were ranked in the top three of both polls
3797879 its exactly where i thought we were going to be voted based on how we did a year ago our goal is to finish among the leaders of the southland conference
3797880 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
3797881 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
3797882 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
3797883 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
3797884 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
3797885 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
3797886 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
3797887 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
3797888 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead
3797889 a r ssia deve manter a sua palavra e agir para p r fim a esta crise
3797890 est o preocupados com as informa es de que as unidades russas est o a assumir posi es a leste da cidade de gori o que lhes permitiria bloquear a auto estrada que divide o pa s de leste a oeste e amea ar tbilissi
3797891 os estados unidos est o ao lado do governo democraticamente eleito da ge rgia e insistem para que a soberania e a integridade territorial da ge rgia seja respeitada
3797892 durante esta viagem ela far esfor os para unir o mundo livre em defesa da ge rgia
3797893 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou
3797894 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful
3797895 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
3797896 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the scale of casualties
3797897 by day five of a conflict one normally expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured or at least an indication of their age and gender but here there is no information absolutely nothing
3797898 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3797899 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3797900 it is a problem especially like on a saturday night
3797901 weve had problems with some of our officers just waiting around for a vehicle
3797902 and it seems like we just cant get enough vehicles to help get our officers out there
3797903 we have a bottleneck that we need to improve we have to admit that
3797904 were working to put police marked squad cars as more of a priority
3797905 weve been scouring the workforce trying to get qualified mechanics
3797906 because we have been spending overtime to get the cars out quicker and we have put police marked squad cars as a priority over other types of fleet like sanitation
3797907 competencies maintenance reallocation fleet management its all of that together that needs to be improved in order not to get to this point
3797908 officers were waiting hours they were riding three to a car four to a car
3797909 some officers were not even making it out and doing half their shift what we have currently is nothing close to what was occurring in 2006
3797910 we need to hire more mechanics and hire them as soon as possible and make sure that this doesnt happen again
3797911 the responsibility stops with the council and the city manager
3797912 its our responsibility to ensure that a mechanism is in place for this not to happen again
3797913 the company plans to produce and market its carbonless power system for green electricity in stationary facilities
3797914 while developments of hydrogen powered vehicles are still progressing there is a compelling need and desire from our customers for a parallel initiative to bring clean hydrogen fueled stationary electrical power to the market
3797915 paradoxically hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but it is not readily available on earth and has to be produced by chemical industry manufacturing systems
3797916 from wastes the plasma converter can actually be the source of startech hydrogen on site and in house for our customers
3797917 when hydrogen as a fuel combines with air the principal resulting product is h2o water
3797918 last summer the company successfully completed a three year contract for the us department of energy in its hydrogen initiative in a comprehensive program demonstrating the production of hydrogen from processing wastes in the plasma converter followed by our starcell tm system starcell is the companys proprietary membrane technology system that separates the hydrogen from the pcg synthesis gas produced by the plasma converter system
3797919 my reaction to dianes well considered post was sideways it seems to me that the seductive nature of our materials and processes can keep us from seeing the wip with a critical eye beginning students in painting studios are often asked what their favorite part of a wip is then told to get rid of it its a hard lesson and often painful but sometimes that wonderful bit is exactly the barrier between something working or not working
3797920 always one step ahead bmw together with continental and mobileye is first to leap ahead and go to market with a multi functional camera in the area of driver assistance
3797921 what is special about the bmw solution is that it runs the three functions sli hba and ldw all using the same camera and microprocessor resources
3797922 the technical challenge is very high compared to a standalone system because the requirements from the camera control are conflicting the combined system must run at a higher frame rate than a standalone system and must share images among the different customer functions the combined system has the advantage of reducing the overall system cost and saving windshield space rather than populating the windshield area with multiple sensing systems the integrative approach allows a single sensor system to perform all the functions and hence reduce space and cost
3797923 ensure that all tcc employees and students are aware of and dedicated to sustainability principles which will be reflected in campus operations curricula and in our interactions with one another and with the community
3797924 the growth of carillion in recent years has resulted in the need for a well managed and structured vehicle remarketing programme and manheims wealth of experience and expertise will contribute greatly to this process
3797925 manheims extensive auctions and remarketing capability and expertise were key factors in the decision to award this contract and i am confident that the team will meet all of carillions requirements and expectations
3797926 we at ford see this years consumer shift to smaller vehicles as an opportunity and one that ford is uniquely positioned to answer using the strength of our european small car lineup and our fast moving global product plan
3797927 we plan to answer the call with dynamic fun to drive small cars and we intend to make them profitably
3797928 weve reduced the number of orderable combinations in north america including series packages and options by 90 percent for the ford brand alone in the 2008 2009 model years
3797929 if you look at the c segment focus will provide approximately 150 combinations by the 2010 model year more than a 95 percent reduction versus the 2008 model year
3797930 were making stylish high quality products to appeal a new breed of buyers
3797931 our small cars need to be more ambitious vehicles than ever delivering style perceived quality and appealing to lifestyle not life stage
3797932 we are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of 2008
3797933 we continued to experience significant growth in all of our major markets we are particularly pleased to see our business in india growing rapidly along with the continued expansion of our business in the chinese bus market we are also very satisfied that our efforts to improve our gross margins continue to produce positive results as our margins remain well above last years level although we expect to continue to make progress in all of these areas during the second half of the year we can also see certain challenges ahead first due to the implementation of new emission standards in the china as of july 1st 2008 we believe there may be a trend on the part of chinese oems to increase orders in the first half of the year which may have a significant downward impact on oem orders during the second half of the year secondly due to government mandated traffic control related to the olympics some of our key customers will halt production during the third quarter it is difficult at this time to project the precise impact these factors while we still expect to have a strong year it is possible we will not be able to duplicate the growth rate of the second quarter
3797934 we are concerned about reports that russian units have taken up positions on the east side of the city of gori which allows them to block the east west highway divide the country and threaten the capital of tbilisi
3797935 we are concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armed vehicles are blocked access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
3797936 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected russia has stated that changing the government of georgia is not its goal
3797937 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
3797938 on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3797939 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3797940 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3797941 mazda wanted to add to the experience of taking part in the mazda london triathlon
3797942 so we introduced a theme to the event heroes and created activities as part of that theme which we hope made the weekend even more memorable for competitors and their families as well as other spectators
3797943 mazda believes that everyone who competes in the mazda london triathlon is a winner whatever their level of ability
3797944 triathlon is about the individual challenge and sense of achievement when crossing the finish line which mazda is reflecting through the heroes theme

3797947 in what is a tough market overall this gives our lexus centres a great advantage in being able to offer the type of car customers want but without the penalties in running costs they would incur with models from rival brands
3797948 the letter confirmed that an investigation into the complaints had been completed the results would be reviewed and recommendations formulated
3797949 management was copied on this letter to further demonstrate the seriousness with which the complaints were being treated
3797950 this major trafford council order reflects the versatility and choice available in citro ns comprehensive lcv range local authority and other operators are able to select citro n lcvs which efficiently match a wide range of operational requirements
3797951 we were asked to provide trafford with new vehicles quickly to replace its ageing fleet the citro n lcv range fulfilled our requirements offering the latest technology best value for money and good availability on all models
3797952 we are currently overhauling our whole vehicle fleet the recent delivery of citro n models is part of a continued and consistent investment to bring our transport activity up to date
3797953 pointer continues to grow and profit we have a healthy geographic breakdown of revenue and an excellent mix between services and products international revenue was responsible for 27 of revenue in q2 2008 and was derived from activities in over 25 countries our technology and products sales generated 40 of our revenues our strong cash generative business model yielded six month ebitda of 8 0 million which enables us to broaden our products and services offering to more customers and look toward expansion into more countries the recently announced partnership in romania is a first and important step in duplicating shagrirs successful economies of scale business and operational model in new territories based upon our financial results in the first six months of 2008 and with better visibility of our business potential both in services and in products we have increased our financial guidance for fiscal year 2008 the increasing demand for high quality technology and services from automotive manufacturers car dealers fleet operators as well as insurance companies continues to provide favourable business opportunities for our company

3797959 to you has been given the secret of the kingdom of god but for those outside everything is in parables so that they may indeed see but not perceive and may indeed hear but not understand lest they should turn again and be forgiven
3797960 truly truly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not marvel that i said to you you must be born anew the wind blows where it wills and you hear the sound of it but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes so it is with every one who is born of the spirit
3797961 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
3797962 the eye is the lamp of the body so if your eye is sound your whole body will be full of light but if your eye is not sound your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness

3798025 im fired up about watching the texans practice against the saints
3798026 i like to see fights as long as no one gets hurt its just players blowing off steam and when linemen go at it against players in different jerseys its bound to happen i cant wait to see the saints defensive linemen react to cut blocking
3798027 its always exciting when the saints are winning because their fans deserve a super bowl team more than any team in the nfl in my opinion
3798028 my opinion has nothing to do with the hurricane it has to do with the loyalty of saints fans since the team was founded by john mecom jr of

3798102 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3798103 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3798104 global political effort must be channelled into securing long lasting green farming solutions that put people not corporations at their heart and the uk government must look at the evidence before falling for gm industry hype
3798105 prince charless comments are a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate about gm crops around the world some of the strongest opposition comes from small and family farmers in south america and india who are already experiencing the social economic and cultural impacts of gm crop monocultures driven forward by global corporations the prince has also focused on the environmental impacts of gm crops especially on the soil very little research is available on such impacts in south america where there is enormous pressure on farmers to adopt gm crops in this country the government decided to ban four gm crops because of their impact on wildlife until very recently research has ignored the impacts on soil and consequently our knowledge of how gm crops will impact on life below ground is very limited the debate about gm crops is not only about science and the prince charless comments will enable the wider social economic cultural and political issues to get the attention they deserve

3798168 la costumbre de buscar si hay elevador o caminar pasos extra hasta las escaleras el ctricas es mala pues le quita a las personas la oportunidad de movilizar su cuerpo utilizar las escaleras ofrece un beneficio cardiovascular y respiratorio que tiene al mismo tiempo efecto en la musculatura
3798169 el sistema m sculo esquel tico se beneficia cuando se ejerce fuerza sobre los miembros inferiores y realmente subir y bajar escaleras es parte de sentirse bien estar bien y poder ser funcional lo que implica una ganancia de la fuerza muscular
3798170 probablemente no es una gran cantidad de energ a la eliminada y no se alcanza a mover grasa sino hasta 15 minutos despu s de iniciado el ejercicio pero s se utilizan az cares para subir unos pisos
3798171 hay m s implicaci n de esfuerzo en las articulaciones de las rodillas en especial la r tula y subir tiene m s impacto en la fuerza muscular y cardiovascular
3798172 es importante que s trates de tener en tu vida diaria una actividad f sica que te genere un aceleramiento del coraz n para tener un beneficio de salud como una caminata en forma programada de 30 minutos
3798173 no hay un estudio cient fico que diga que subir escaleras es mejor que caminar o correr lo que s hay son estudios que dicen que el ejercicio aer bico es mucho mejor y si comparamos caminar o subir escaleras contra el elevador definitivamente es mucho mejor
3798174 la recomendaci n es que intentes ver el gran beneficio que te puede producir subir y bajar escaleras donde quiera que te encuentres o donde transites

3798186 simply not the way that international relations can be run in the 21st century
3798187 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3798188 that is a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a 19th century way of doing politics
3798189 i think it is very very important as a european level but also at the un that we assert that this is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3798190 the russians want to assert this concept i think of ex soviet space somehow denying that these are independent countries on their borders with sovereignty and rights of their own i think that is unacceptable
3798191 the soviet union does not exist anymore there is no such thing as ex soviet space there is a new map of eastern europe and the border areas of russia
3798192 that new map needs to be defended in the interests of security and stability
3798193 i believe it is actually in russias interests to come to terms with that it is not in russias interests to continue to hanker for a soviet past because frankly its gone and its good that its gone
3798194 it is unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days

3798209 once you put that gene in its there for the rest of that persons life
3798210 gene therapy has now broken out from what seemed to be too little progress and has now shown real therapies for a couple diseases and more coming
3798211 please give me new instructions soon so that i can order the product before christmas
3798212 ive had athletes come to my lectures and go to the microphone and say if i took this drug would it work with epo and growth hormone i mean they would ask this publicly
3798213 based on athletes ive talked with id say that its a reasonable possibility that gene doping will be used in this olympics and i think theres a very high probability that it will be used in the next olympics
3798214 a key part of our project is to try to define what we call signatures of doping
3798215 we are looking at the impact of those kinds of genetic manipulations at different levels
3798216 in sport you dont know where that gene will be put what virus was used or even what particular variety of gene was used
3798217 you dont have the advantage of knowing where to look and for what so the argument is to look everywhere
3798218 no ones expecting that an athlete will agree to a muscle biopsy
3798219 the reality is that you can just inject naked dna directly into tissues
3798220 direct injection could be more local and harder to detect
3798221 there will be a body wide response no matter what gene you use or where in the body you put it
3798222 and those changes can be used as a signature of doping
3798223 theres good reason to think thats likely to work and a number of labs are having some nice results
3798224 we never say when our tests are going to be in place
3798225 with stored blood and urine samples one always has the option of going back some months or years later and checking again with the newest tests
3798226 la verdad objetiva de los hechos vistos a traves de mi subjetivo cristal pero toda la verdad solo la verdad y nada mas que la verdad sin jurar sobre biblia alguna
3798227 due to my experiences of having to implement policies which i knew and my political masters knew were unsupported or even contradicted by evidence
3798228 what harms society is the illegality of drugs and all the costs associated with that
3798229 what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves
3798230 yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be
3798231 current period will be temporary and inflation will return to the two per cent target
3798232 the authors of this report have themselves admitted it is barmy it isnt it is insane
3798233 regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past three years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities
3798234 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3798235 claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3798236 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes
3798237 internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3798238 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new labour government has invested heavily in urban regeneration
3798239 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3798240 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3798241 reaffirms policy exchanges long standing commitment to localism a commitment we have pledged in our previous reports on urban regeneration
3798242 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people

3798245 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
3798246 these managers are available at a reasonable cost and most use a sliding compensation scale
3798247 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3798248 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee

3798279 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3798280 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3798281 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3798282 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3798283 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3798284 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3798285 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3798286 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3798287 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real

3798290 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3798291 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3798292 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3798293 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3798294 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3798295 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3798296 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3798297 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3798298 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3798299 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high
3798300 in 1998 and 1999 stocks were really down but the companies then were not really full of assets now the boxes are full
3798301 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3798302 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3798303 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3798304 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3798305 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3798306 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3798307 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3798308 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3798309 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3798310 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3798311 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3798312 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3798313 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3798314 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3798315 there is no way the regime in south ossetia can be in any sense called
3798316 it south ossetias government is a joint venture of siloviki generals and ossetian bandits for making money in a conflict with georgia my boldface for me the most surprising thing in this entire story is the complete lack of any strategic goals on the part of the south ossetians
3798317 whenever someone starts telling us about shelling in tskhinvali it is important to keep in mind exactly what tskhinvali is it is not a city somewhere in the middle of a republic that is being fired upon by saboteurs on three sides tskhinvali is surrounded by georgian villages the edge of tskhinvali is a military outpost south ossetian forces fire from there into the georgian villages and the georgians respond with fire of their own to help keep georgian fire from hitting civilians in the city all the south ossetians would have to do is move their military base forward a couple hundred meters but of course it is a fundamental principle of terrorists the world over set up firing points in civilian areas and then when your enemy fires on you you gleefully parade the bodies of your own children in front of the television cameras kokoitys terrorists are following this same principle if south ossetia can in any way be considered a state it must be considered a terrorist state when we are told about peaceful civilians in south ossetia we must keep in mind that the situation there is similar to that in palestinian refugee camps south ossetia like the palestinian liberation organization before it is not a state or an ethos or a territory it is a peculiar form of mutated government in which residents have been turned into militarized refugees

3798322 the election confirmed the emergence of a two party system in american politics a development that must have seemed ironic to some federalists and democratic republicans
3798323 because most of them had believed with george washington that the appearance of parties would do more harm than good washington commanded respect enough to engineer unanimous presidential victories in 1789 and 1792 but during the presidency of washingtons successor john adams political factions began warring openly adams and the federalists had led the nation into an undeclared naval war with france and in the process expressed an activist concept of government that vice president thomas jefferson and the democratic republicans thought contradicted democratic principles

3798327 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football

3798366 while the wipeout animations have been given a much needed boost in realism things were fine in the first skate when you were on your board but if you so much as clipped a bench it would result in your character going strangely limp only to greet the concrete with no objections whatsoever now youll see your character flail during high drops brace himself for impact and kick out his board when a landing seems impossible considering the steep learning curve of the control system these new touches should give newcomers an entertaining show while they learn the ropes and it all plays out in 60 frames per second double that of the previous game

3798461 on day one we were given instructions in terms of implementing a green agenda
3798462 there was a general objective that this was the green olympics so we had to consider energy conservation and water recycling but in terms of details it was up to designers to come up with solutions
3798463 the water cube is very much a green building because of the way the buildings features work it had inherent advantages of saving energy and also retaining and recycling rainwater
3798464 china is going through a green push and theres a lot of buildings that have these elements water recycling maximizing natural light etc its all moving in that direction
3798465 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea

3798467 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3798468 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to b
3798469 personally im very happy and i hope ive made the fans happy
3798470 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3798482 chinas leaders know the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development

3798500 since then attackers have fine tuned their exploits resulting in even more widespread attacks
3798501 the snapshot viewer issue impacts any internet explorer 7 users that have the activex control installed and any internet explorer 6 users regardless if they have the control installed or not the nature of the control allows the attacker to install malicious code and exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction
3798502 once exploit code for the dns vulnerability announced in july became available microsoft took the unusual step to issue this security advisory that encouraged customers to update their dns servers asap even though the original bulletin rating was an important and not as critical
3798503 given the publicly available exploit code and the possible compromise of critical dns services it teams that have not deployed this
3798504 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3798505 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3798506 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3798507 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3798508 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3798509 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3798510 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3798511 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3798512 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3798513 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3798514 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3798515 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3798516 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3798517 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3798518 they injected an anesthetic but didnt wait long enough for it to take effect

3798521 violence will keep increasing to the extent that mexican law enforcement doesnt take away the attraction of committing a crime
3798522 the media and society as a whole has finally recognized that there is a problem
3798523 we cant tolerate any more of this level of impunity and criminal activities
3798524 its criminals who should be afraid its the bad politicians who should be afraid its the judges who set these murderers free the ones who should be afraid its the corrupt police officers who should be afraid not us
3798525 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
3798526 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
3798527 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected

3798531 he really knows how to use his body to create space
3798532 he may be the most muscular back i have ever seen that has excellent agility
3798533 he demonstrated excellent power speed and change of direction all three days at fbu
3798534 he also gives each practice rep 110 percent similar to what i saw in when he was at the georgia rising senior camp two years ago
3798535 thomas might not look fast when hes lined up man to man against a cornerback but when he gets going he can blow past defensive backs with his long strides
3798536 he also carries his weight well and still is lean when he fills out and hits the weight room he should be able to develop into one of the most athletic tight ends around
3798537 brown is extremely quick for a back his size 6 0 215 and also has nice hands coming out of the backfield
3798538 he is one back who is physically ready to compete at the next level right now richardson is probably the most physically impressive athlete i have seen he has soft hands out of the backfield and really knows how to use his muscular frame to get open most backs this thick are not as nimble
3798539 wood once he starts heading vertical his acceleration is off the chart his running style is reminiscent of darren mcfadden he also will be a threat catching passes out of the backfield but he just needs to add some size to his lean frame 6 0 192
3798540 he is what i call a five tool back he is fast has a great change of direction good hands great physique and is a real leader
3798541 i came in with a lot more confidence and i came to compete
3798542 thats awesome coaches can go their whole career without an all american player and ive had two former arizona state and current nfl tight end zach miller and now devon

3798545 conducting a gigantic experiment with nature which has gone seriously wrong
3798546 no scientist working in the agricultural sector doubts that the intensification of cropping over the last 50 or so years coupled with climate change in some cases has led to severe challenges including areas of land becoming unsuitable for the cultivation of conventional crop varieties it is scientifically and morally indefensible not to explore without prejudice gm technology as one possible solution to these problems
3798547 prince charles claims that gm crops will be an environmental disaster but his vision for agriculture would be a much greater disaster for the worlds poor whose primary concern is to find their next meal recent studies demonstrate that gm crops can generate crop yield increases particularly in the developing world where so much food crop ends up in the belly of an insect or destroyed by drought meanwhile while much of the world starves prince charles tells the poor to eat organic cake and spends a fortune converting his aston martin to run off surplus wine as a display of conspicuous environmentalism yet to drive from london to his highgrove estate in his converted aston consumes wine produced from about a ton of grapes food resource that would be far better diverted to feed hungry mouths prince charles showy environmentalism is a luxury that makes the poor poorer
3798548 prince charles indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them these problems arise from a collective failure of societies all of us to live within the resources of our planet to blame all of these problems on a single technology is to deny our collective responsibility for the mess weve created
3798549 genetic modification is and will continue to provide valuable solutions to improve the sustainability of our agricultural systems but maintain the yields that are essential for global food production genetic modification is not a threat to small scale farmers we function in a free market and small scale farmers just as large scale farmers can choose to plant gm seed or not the princes ill informed and confusing statements are counterproductive to a rational debate on our food production systems
3798550 to label gm crops as either good or bad for the environment completely misses the point the scientific evidence shows that some gm crops for example those resistant to insect pests can actually bring environmental benefits by reducing the application of synthetic pesticides
3798551 gm crops are being grown on a large scale in many countries of the world a total of 114m hectares in 2007 mainly in north america brazil and argentina it has been estimated recently that over the last 10 years they have provided an economic benefit to the farmers growing these crops of 33 8bn also the reduction of energy needed to cultivate the crops is estimated to be equivalent to taking 6 5m cars off the roads

3798561 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components

3798563 im not another blah blah blah person ranting about how bad the world is and how guilty you should feel for taking up space in it
3798564 its a conversation about what it means to be a new kind of christian not an angry and reactionary fundamentalist not a stuffy traditionalist not a blas nominalist not a wishy washy liberal not an new agey religious hipster not a crusading religious imperialist and not an over enthused bible waving fanatic but something fresh and authentic and challenging and adventurous
3798565 they share my belief that the versions of christianity we inherited are largely flattened watered down tamed offering us a ticket to heaven after death but not challenging us to address the issues that threaten life on earth
3798566 why hasnt the christian religion made a difference commensurate with its message size and resources what would need to happen for followers of jesus to become a greater force for good in relation to the worlds top problems how could we make a positive difference
3798567 did north american church leaders teach the early colonists to treat the native peoples with love and respect did they consistently and with one voice oppose slavery because it was an assault on the dignity of fellow human beings later in our history did they express outrage over the exploitation of factory workers or the second class status of women did they stand up for refugees and immigrants did they oppose white privilege segregation anti semitism stereotyping of muslims and other forms of ethnic prejudice
3798568 we considered how this message of the kingdom contrary to popular belief was not focused on how to escape this world and its problems by going to heaven after death but instead was focused on how gods will could be done on earth in history during this life we described gods kingdom in terms of gods dreams coming true for this earth of gods justice and peace replacing earths injustice and disharmony
3798569 the whole christian world is pretty much screwed up and misguided and im going to set it straight
3798570 learning about the dark side of the christian religions track record the crusades witch burnings colonialism slavery the holocaust apartheid environmental irresponsibility mistreatment of women
3798571 more and more reflective christian leaders are beginning to realize that for the millions of young adults who dropped out of their churches in the late twentieth and early twentieth first centuries the christian religion appears to be a failed religion
3798572 truly good news they feel would confront systemic injustice target significant global dysfunctions and provide hope and resources for making a better world along with helping individuals experience a full life
3798573 but to hold our faith in good conscience we need to debug it from the viruses modern western colonial imperial rationalist reductionist and other types of viruses that seem to have invaded its software
3798574 we find nested in the larger framing story shared by both rich and poor a huge bank of patriotic and religious stories that celebrate how redemptive violence has helped good people us to defeat evil people them throughout history
3798575 news of course means a story a story of something that has happened or is happening that you should know about
3798576 jesus was saying in essence there are a lot of bad stories in our world
3798577 of course there arent really just two views there are hundreds at least as many as there are denominations of christianity and maybe even as many as there are individual christians since each of us has a view of jesus both like and unlike the views of others
3798578 jesus came to be the savior of the world meaning he came to save the earth and all it contains from its ongoing destruction because of human evil
3798579 prevail over the evil and injustice of humanity and lead to the worlds ongoing transformation into the world god dreams of
3798580 poses little or no significant challenge to the dominant framing story that currently directs our societal machinery in its suicidal trajectory
3798581 the conventional view relegates jesus to practical irrelevance in relation to human social problems in history his message is about the soul its guilt before god and its afterlife not about our world and its crises
3798582 jesus in the conventional view has little or nothing to say regarding the worlds global crises the real issue is our individual souls and their eternal postmortem destiny
3798583 dont let your lives be framed by the narratives and counternarratives of the roman empire but situate yourselves in another story the good news that god is king and we can live in relation to god and gods love rather than caesar and caesars power
3798584 the bibles purpose we assume is to explain how to go to heaven to legitimize certain religious institutions to define in detail universal timeless truths to provide a detailed timeline for the end of the world and so on
3798585 from jesus perspective outside the imperial narrative and within gods liberating framing story the steward is wise rather than unjust wise enough to defect as the rich young ruler should have done from the service of the wealthy elite to give a break to the poor who are being crushed by the societal machinery driven by the imperial narrative
3798586 jesus is saying risk everything including your life to stand up to caesar and join me in my revolution not by fighting and killing but by being willing to die with me
3798587 in this light exorcisms become signs and wonders prophetic actions that first depict the possession of israel by the demonic forces of empire and then predict their expulsion by the kingdom of god
3798588 this emerging understanding of jesus locating him in relation to the narratives and counternarratives of empire
3798589 for jesus to lead his disciples to this city then would be an intentional move evoking many layers of meaning perhaps akin to a leader today bringing his followers to auschwitz hiroshima soweto or the gaza strip
3798590 jesus says using a phrase that could aptly be paraphrased the authority structures and control centers of evil
3798591 my kingdom is not of this world then means the very opposite of my kingdom is not in this world instead it means my kingdom is very much in this world but it doesnt work the way earthly kingdoms or empires do
3798592 these fundamentalist movements also underestimate how equally situated their own interpretations and applications are
3798593 too few of them realize how the very scholarly terms they use constantly gain and shed negative and positive connotations nor are they aware of the power dynamics hidden in their methods and vocabularies this na vet is so pervasive and so accepted that one can hardly blame people for being taken in by it yet with suicide bombings in the news day after day we can see where this na vet can lead
3798594 it requires the ability to get a sense for the shape feel and direction of jesus life and words in the swirl and spin of his times and find patterns of resonance with our own it is from start to finish a matter of interpretation which like reading itself is as much art as science
3798595 the empire uses crosses to punish rebels and instill fear and submission in the oppressed jesus will use a cross to expose the cruelty and injustice of those in power and instill hope and confidence in the oppressed
3798596 clearly jesus is deconstructing the dominant system of exclusion not fortifying it
3798597 no less striking than his family imagery though less often appreciated is jesus sensitivity to ecology evident in his many parables about farming and fishing and weather
3798598 to address the global security crisis jesus might speak of the
3798599 the equity gap that separates rich from poor renders them enemies rather than neighbors so everyone is caught up in the ultimate vicious cycle of terror and counterterror violence and counterviolence hate and counterhate
3798600 jesus might confront the global prosperity crisis by announcing the
3798601 jesus might encapsulate his alternative framing story in the image of
3798602 like lovers whose mutual affection overflows and seeks to express itself in the triune miracle of intercourse conception and birth the living god creates a universe to express and share a generous overflow of love joy and life
3798603 sadly because we are so fully indoctrinated by the imperial framing narrative of our day few of us can begin to imagine how different it would be to live in the framing story of jesus
3798604 what barry calls true religion a proper love and respect for all gods creatures names the sacred ecosystem of god which is the kingdom of god which is the only sane alternative to the destructive economies and narratives that drive our world today as it was in the days of jesus
3798605 please please dont make what i am saying ridiculous by calling it a flower child theology or relating it to some kind of idealistic romantic nonsense please ask yourself what if jesus isnt being cute and romantic in the sermon on the mount
3798606 this version reflects a deconversion a return to trust in the power of pilate not the unarmed truth that stood before pilate refusing to fight
3798607 this is why i believe that many of our current eschatologies intoxicated by dubious interpretations of johns apocalypse are not only ignorant and wrong but dangerous and immoral
3798608 we can begin rebuilding our societal system not as a suicidal machine but as a beloved community the kind of garden city envisioned in johns apocalypse
3798609 we are in the early stages of a radical reassessment of jesus
3798610 he gains new insight into the god given scope of his mission
3798611 for jesus the motto is peace through nonviolent justice peace through the forgiveness of enemies peace through reconciliation peace through embrace and grace
3798612 just as fine wines and well crafted beers offer much for aficionados to appreciate as would i imagine a well bred strain of cannabis or opium war offers many fine and noble things to be celebrated and appreciated
3798613 jesus good news of the kingdom of god addresses the security system as we have seen in powerful and far reaching ways it offers not a prescription but a way not a formula but an adventure of faith hope and love it is not a matter of na ve ignorance about the power of evil or a deluded romanticism about the good heart of the enemy it is rather a loss of naivete about the power of violence to cure violence it is a dose of realism about the futility of seeking security through living by the sword matthew 26 52
3798614 become powerful forms of religious broadcasting evoking fear and hope love and hate obedience and rebellion forming souls under the guidance of famous spiritual directors
3798615 every living system of earth is in decline every life support system of earth is in decline were leaving a terrible legacy of poisoning and diminishment of the environment for our grandchildrens grandchildren
3798616 if jesus is indeed a hero who can inspire others to heroism at this critical moment then he must address this carelessness about future generations inherent in our contemporary societal narrative he must expose the intergenerational tyranny and suicide insanity of theocapitalist faith he must bring a better story
3798617 with no apologies to martin luther john calvin or modern evangelicalism jesus in luke 16 19 does not prescribe hell to those who refuse to accept the message of justification by grace through faith or to those who are predestined for perdition or to those who dont express faith in a favored atonement theory by accepting jesus as their personal savior rather hell literal or figurative is for the rich and comfortable who proceed on their way without concern for their poor neighbor day after day
3798618 those who dont express faith in a favored atonement theory
3798619 youre just promoting salvation through expressing faith in your favored atonement theory
3798620 that man has his wealth because he stole it from the poor
3798621 both the poor and the rich need saving one needs liberation from addictive wealth and the other liberation from oppressive poverty
3798622 as it rewards the aggressive the dominant and the hasty the prosperity system withholds rewards from the peaceful the humble and the morally sensitive those who arrive first to a field of competition especially those with the needed tools or weapons to commander resources from others are given an insurmountable unfair advantage
3798623 the successful succeed only at the expense of the unsuccessful
3798624 we must take seriously the full dimensions of collective sin
3798625 i think about the united states growing ever more conservative because it has so much to conserve
3798626 our current politicians and religious leaders as those in jesus day seem hell bent on trivial matters
3798627 im suggesting that if we go deep enough we will realize that democrats and republicans left and right even terrorists and free world are generally playing by the same rules and part of the same system in much the same way as in jesus day complacent herodians and sadducees and activist pharisees and zealots were for all the squabbles playing within the same system defining their lives in relation to caesar
3798628 more and more of us see this eschatology of abandonment and despair to be an example of the biblical story being rewritten to aid and abet the dominant system we believe the vision of the new jerusalem like all prophetic visions seeks to inspire our imaginations with hope about what our world can actually become through the good news of the kingdom of god
3798629 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

3798631 three or four years from now no mobile device vendor no matter what their market position today will be in a comfort zone

3798633 robotics trends is delighted to announce the robodevelopment academic outreach program
3798634 with this announcement robotics trends continues its long history of working with leading academic and research institutions to expand the personal service and mobile robotics industry while it is true that the robodevelopment conference and exposition focuses on the design and development of commercial robots and robotic technology it is equally true that todays college students are tomorrows robotics leaders and the next generation of innovative commercial robotics products are currently under development in university laboratories across the world in essence therefore the robodevelopment academic outreach program is a workforce development and productization initiative
3798635 i dont see this always as an area of problems
3798636 i see this as an area of possibilities where we think about historic neighbourhoods and what they provided to the city what they provided to the province

3798641 the original smiley was created in 1964 by commercial artist harvey ball
3798642 i often think there should exist a special typographichal sign for a smile some sort of concave mark a supine round bracket
3798643 like so many things plato was doing emoticons and smileys online and on screen years earlier in fact emoticons on plato were already an art form by 1976 plato users began doing smiley characters probably as early as 1972 when plato iv came out but possible even earlier of plato iii
3798644 emotions have become an important part of the online culture
3798645 they make it easy and quick to communicate emotions something that many people find difficult to express using words particularly when dealing with people from diverse social and educational backgrounds
3798646 it is true that e mails do not accurately capture our feelings how could they most are written quickly with little regard for nouns or are just official communication i recall an incident at work when a young lady caused a lot of aggravation to a co worker due to her perceived abrasive style confronted by the manager she was at a loss and started crying she simply was not good with written communication emoticons may help somewhat i personally do not use them i rely on my words to do the whole job i think a lot also depends on who the recipient is style or the rapport of the sender with other person if the two correspondents do not know each others style mishap can occur emoticons introduce a note of informality i can hardly imagine an e mail from our corporate heads bearing emoticons it is suitable for peer to peer communication
3798647 emoticons may seem silly but they fulfill an important function though emoticons cannot replace the full range of non verbal communication
3798648 they can go a long way towards changing the mood of written statement and the or the acronym that i think looks like smileys can make it clear that you mean something in a light hearted manner just as a reassuring smile or laugh might if you were speaking so while i personally do not use a wide range of emoticons or use them very often i believe they are important tools for online communication
3798649 the primary purpose of emoticons in e mail and live chats is to minimize misunderstandings especially when a joke could be misconstrued as a serious statement and therefore hurt the recipients feelings hence the frequent use of smiley faces however emoticons should not be overused or take the place of good writing and clear communication even in live chats
3798650 the last thing i want to do is writing more than what is absolutely necessary so i use these typographical smileys that are computer equivalent of handmade drawings advantageously whenever i can the problem is that smileys are yet not standard there are so many different dictionaries each defining them differently dictionaries each defining them differently many have to be explained every time they are used even while communicating within it professionals community

3799054 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances confronting both hispanic immigrants and hispanics born in the united states
3799055 upon inspecting the problem i found that the video would turn on the screen would flicker for a second each of black and the video a few times and then the blue screen of drm came up it also wouldnt play any premium channels
3799056 how many billions has the industry spent on drm schemes that the bad guys break in weeks how many perfectly legitimate users has the industry annoyed and driven away how many lost dvd sales has it caused how many lost sales of microsofts media center software and windows vista has it caused because the drm sub system randomly decides that you must be a criminal

3799166 as soon as they saw it they went right in according to a monroe district police lieutenant
3799167 they started banging on the doors and getting people out according to the lieutenant who said two officers one male one female suffered smoke inhalation but were treated on the scene
3799168 the office of fire investigation has determined the cause of the fire at 1508 1510 1504 w 18th st as incendiary
3799169 and at this time the police bomb and arson section is conducting a further investigation
3799170 dress rehearsal for an all out cyberwar once the shooting started between georgia and russia
3799171 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so youd be foolish not to
3799172 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3799173 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3799174 defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
3799175 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
3799176 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
3799177 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
3799178 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
3799179 this level of investment in our network is a testament to our ongoing commitment to providing the best levels of service and support in the industry
3799180 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3799181 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3799182 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3799183 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3799184 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3799185 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3799186 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3799187 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3799188 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3799189 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3799190 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3799191 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3799192 i made the cover very plain so a guy could read it in coffee shops and no one else would know hes reading a book about getting laid
3799193 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3799194 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3799195 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3799196 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3799197 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3799198 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3799199 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3799200 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3799201 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3799202 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3799203 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3799204 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3799205 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3799206 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3799207 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3799208 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3799209 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3799210 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3799211 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3799212 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3799213 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3799214 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3799215 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3799216 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3799217 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3799218 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3799219 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3799220 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3799221 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3799222 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3799223 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3799224 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3799225 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3799226 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3799227 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3799228 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3799229 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3799230 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3799231 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3799232 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3799233 social dialogue between the west and north korea is very limited
3799234 the invitation means that pyongyang is beginning to have non political talks with western society
3799235 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3799236 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3799237 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3799238 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3799239 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3799240 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3799241 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3799242 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3799243 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3799244 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3799245 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3799246 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3799247 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation ame capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3799248 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours
3799249 would you be happy with that delay if it were your son
3799250 its like john madden we can circle guys draw arrows and show where everyone is going
3799251 maestro dobel is a luxurious silver tequila with the complexity of an aged spirit
3799252 i felt like a lot of americans were there so it felt really good
3799253 it is a little slow in the press so i can go see sister serena play im ok with everything
3799254 to win here singles or doubles is the same as winning a major
3799255 maybe even more precious its right up there for me
3799256 support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending ten billion dollars a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy
3799257 barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
3799258 and when he had given thanks he gave it to them saying for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
3799259 its time to break tradition you must consume my life as it is given as an offering for you
3799260 my house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers
3799261 i cant say if the card was justified or not because i didnt see the play but it is extremely difficult to play a game when you lose a man by the fourth minute u
3799262 it changed the game completely the lineup is affected the whole mentality is in the trash maybe the referee made a rash decision but thats behind us and theres nothing we can do
3799263 make harsh comments about the officials but nowak then said
3799264 just killed the game and he thought the referee should have issued a caution rather than ejecting orozco
3799265 this match was harder than we thought nigerian forward victor anichebe said
3799266 they even hit the bar near the end and they were good despite being reduced to 10 men very early
3799267 we created something really special in a short amount of time and came really close to going to the quarterfinals we tied the netherlands 2 2 and should have won and then we fought hard with a man down almost the whole game we have a lot to be proud of
3799268 significa romper barreira e combater a discrimina o em rela o popula o afrodescendente
3799269 historicamente aconteceu isso vai mais para o ponto emblem tico para aqueles que entendem que n o poss vel poss vel
3799270 if theres one public official who has consistently put his country ahead of his party working across party lines to get things done in washington it is john mccain
3799271 sen obama has no record that i can see of taking on positions that are held by a lot of people within his own party
3799272 john mccain does that all the time its part of the reason it took some while for a lot of republicans to come to his side sen mccain has worked across party lines on the big issues of our time because he knows he has no patience for partisan politics and all those games
3799273 we fought equal to equal we were two very strong teams and unfortunately we had this break
3799274 we are proud of each other no matter what i think that we represented usa very well
3799275 my goal was to come out and know that at the end of the competition id have no regrets
3799276 i definitely have no regrets im happy with how everything went and to say that you have an olympic medal is just amazing
3799277 its the olympic games and we have a silver medal the chinese were the better team today we had a few mistakes the only disappointment for me was that i couldnt contribute more to the team
3799278 leaving beijing with a silver medal is such an honor
3799279 to have a medal hanging around my neck from the olympics is remarkable were all so proud of everyone
3799280 you have good days and bad days and i just wish that today was a good day for me
3799281 my teammates were amazing today but i just wish that my performance was a little better
3799282 we gave it our hearts but china was just having a really good day today
3799283 uma boa pauta para as atividades da c mara para esta e a pr xima semana
3799284 cada dia temos de resolver um problema novo que se apresenta a paralisa o da casa com a obstru o e a falta de acordo tinham de ser resolvidos hoje s quero comemorar
3799285 we have ron paul supporters on staff and volunteering in our campaign offices and in our field organizations around the state
3799286 what would you like to say about abortion and euthanasia in washington state
3799287 my wife terry and i are catholic and we believe that every soul has a value
3799288 these are not issues i am running on but ones i will continue to believe in they are issues of conscience
3799289 in my own life i have seen loved ones struggle with the infirmities that accompany age and illness my mother battled and eventually succumbed to breast cancer but both she and our family valued every moment that we were able to spend together until the end
3799290 i do not believe the state should force pharmacies to stock or sell plan b or any other drug
3799291 just as government shouldnt tell grocery store owners that they have to sell certain types of groceries or hardware store owners that they have to sell certain types of tools it shouldnt tell pharmacists which drugs to sell
3799292 as governor i will be committed to improving our public schools
3799293 but i will also support the rights of parents and students to decide the course of education thats best for them
3799294 when i balanced the budget in 2003 we had a democrat controlled house and a democrat in the governors mansion
3799295 the key to success was working to find a philosophical majority rather than a partisan majority that is exactly how i will work to address the deficit as governor
3799296 it was important to prove to the team that were not done yet
3799297 thats why i was back on the bike an hour or so after the crash were a team and i needed to do the best i could for them i think it was the right thing to do
3799298 i had a good start and i was behind chris
3799299 i thought he was overriding the bike he was really pushing i needed to lead the most laps for the two point bonus it was win or lose if you dont try you dont crash i tried a little too hard but i had to
3799300 i was sitting on the pit wall and i started feeling my fingers again
3799301 i had no grip on the tank but once i got used to riding with the injury i got more confident
3799302 im sure if i had started from the front row i could have finished as high as eighth the last few laps i was crying in my helmet but it was worth it
3799303 i wanted to try and get him at the last corner but i just didnt have enough
3799304 about five or six laps in i couldnt feel my left hand
3799305 so i was working with just one hand then at halfway the fingers on my right hand went numb the last few laps i wanted to pull in every lap but i knew i had a good enough gap that race was the hardest one of the weekend
3799306 i wish i could have got third in the pro 600 race on sunday because that would have given me more room for shannonville
3799307 but well be good for the next round the wrist isnt as sore now i just have to take it easy and if its good enough that i can ride my bike a week before shannonville it will be nice to get some training in
3799308 elle a galement indiqu avoir consomm du cannabis dans la nuit de samedi dimanche chez ses parents o elle avait organis une f te loccasion dun anniversaire

3799310 it seems that the bomb was detonated wirelessly by remote
3799311 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes
3799312 although the policeman was in civvies the mob identified him by his identity card they set fire to his motorcycle and beat him up mercilessly
3799313 its too late for that now just move on and let it go
3799314 i think the statements of your vice president of this sort are the same as an unsuccessful hunting shot
3799315 leave the past behind it not worth losing tru luv to the ones who did u wrong they had there chance and they fuked it up so fuk da past and heres to present and future
3799316 baby i admit i was wrong for treating you the way i did im sorry i never showed you the love i hold so true in my heart im sorry i never took the time to make the lil things counts im sorry for ever hurting u in any way i know i am realizing this way too late but am i too late i took a big step and grew from it and i just only wanna prove it i really dont want to use my changes on someone new i want to use them on u the love of my life the one i want to marry but am i really too late did i realize everything 2 late
3799317 if you care about what others think youll never feel comfortable
3799318 democracy is second only to tyranny for its implicit evil
3799319 we have an economy which is diversified we have a workforce that we have upgraded year by year better educated better able to earn more because we are connected with the world and our incomes can rise because of our higher skills and higher technology
3799320 we have succeeded so far in housing in health in education in job facilities we will do our best to re train people who are being retrenched to upgrade their skills but we must face facts this gap is going to remain for five ten or more years
3799321 i liked the idea of being my own boss and i had this picture in my head that i would make the sixty second commute to the computer in my socks and spend my day being focused and hyper productive
3799322 all these things needed to be done they all seemed important i was always torn
3799323 our atlantean ancestors differed more from present day man than anyone would imagine whose knowledge is confined wholly to the world of the senses this difference extended not only to external appearance but also to spiritual faculties their knowledge their technical skills indeed their entire civilization differed from what can be observed today
3799324 hey martha lookie here that aprill brandon girl used the word affect wrong lets call the neighbors and get the pitchforks
3799325 so exactly what is it you want me to write
3799326 any of the ways these militant feminists are trying to take down men
3799327 you know what i cringed when i saw you were a woman i want to talk to a male reporter you dont understand and i just dont trust you
3799328 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3799329 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3799330 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3799331 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3799332 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3799333 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3799334 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3799335 when things go bump in the night im the sissy who bumps them back
3799336 love is a chemical attraction between two people influenced by environmental and cultural factors for the purposes of finding a suitable mate to further ones family line
3799337 we were not built to be happy but to reproduce
3799338 today we have to re establish consciously that vital connection which we willfully broke we have a mind which can soar into the highest regions but how few of the wonderful thoughts conceived there can we really bring to practical fruition potentially the strongest and noblest of natures children we have become what we actually are now the weakest and most helpless of all simply because of the pride and conceit which let us to separate ourselves from universal powers in order that we might be self sufficient our roots are dangling in the air
3799339 i stay at home and take care of this little guy
3799340 oh so you have kids youd like to stay at home with
3799341 roxanne you dont got to work for money no more
3799342 how blessed is the man in whose spirit there is no deceit
3799343 surely you desire truth in the inner parts you teach me wisdom in the inmost place
3799344 god is light and in him there is no darkness at all
3799345 walk in the light as he himself is in the light
3799346 well last night i was working on our taxes i had guessed that we were going to receive a slight refund but this morning i got up and finished entering all our gifts and exemptions and babe were getting back almost exactly 3 200
3799347 i will take care of you i will receive glory for this gift i am the benefactor you are the beneficiary
3799348 you have never in the entire time i have worked for you since 1985 paid me even close to what i was worth i gave up my fucking life to help make you the evil queen you are today 15 years listening to your bitching egotistical ranting mediocre talent and lack of taste that would stun the ages every ounce of talent you have you have sucked dry from me and the people around you i certainly never worked for you for the money now you accuse me of lying and cheating you youve got some fucking nerve as usual you have lost all sense of reality i guess i always thought that one day youd see my worth and behave accordingly but you never did a little respect was all i ever wanted from you and you couldnt even manage that
3799349 when things go bump in the night im the sissy who bumps them back
3799350 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3799351 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3799352 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3799353 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3799354 there are people who dont agree with something and they try to express themselves you have people like this in your country
3799355 within this framework our hardware maintenance services can support pcs servers laptops printers and peripherals
3799356 in addition to this we can maintain their sun and other unix platforms making it much easier to manage by having a single point of contact for all hardware needs not to mention much more cost effective than the traditional sources
3799357 but advances in nanotechnology in recent years have finally allowed us to build these structures
3799358 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
3799359 the software is exceptionally cost effective and really helps us
3799360 the relevant maps went blank as soon as fighting broke out
3799361 google has not made any recent change to georgia armenia and azerbaijan in google maps
3799362 we do not have local data for those countries and that is why local details such as landmarks and cities do not appear
3799363 a t il expliqu mais lorigine de lintoxication ne sera formellement connue que jeudi soir au plus tard
3799364 quer amos dar una imagen perfecta y pensamos en lo que ser a mejor para la patria
3799365 se cumple la m xima la suerte de la fea la bonita la desea
3799366 the language in the platform is a real step forward
3799367 for those women who want to take the child to term it strongly supports that choice and provides necessary support
3799368 historic moment that does a lot for democrats catholics and women
3799369 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3799370 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3799371 might well place the topic of obamas blackness along with his patriotism and his candor about what he heard in the pews in all those years at trinity church squarely at the center of the national debate
3799372 barry was muslim he was registered as a muslim because his father was muslim
3799373 yeah you liberals always coddled the soviets and were anti reagan nothing has changed has it

3799396 the goal is to walk on all the trail miles in the wilderness
3799397 i really like the idea of the mapping weeds and finding out where they are and getting them treated
3799398 ive definitely gained a knowledge of invasive weeds and their ecology
3799399 theres a direct correlation between the amount of use and the kind of use and the amount of weeds the farther back you go theres fewer weeds
3799400 learning about the weeds was great even though we didnt see that many
3799401 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
3799402 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
3799403 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
3799404 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
3799405 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
3799406 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
3799407 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3799408 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3799409 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3799410 stumbled at stumbleupon they understood and immediately decided to hold off any suspension of my blog
3799411 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3799412 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3799415 a questionable education a lot of american christians would have good reason not to want their kids subjected to german state schools the sex education curriculum is often pornographic even for young ages and the occult is often celebrated missionary robinson told cbn news i know of schools right in our area where its not just mixed swimming but mixed showering after the swim class is over and mixed locker rooms and then they leave and go to the next class german home schooler heiko krautter told us he would be sinning to put his children in a state school he said these things in the school the official state school they destroy the children and we teach the children in the things of god and the people in the official school teach the children in other things against god krautter fled germany after this interview and took his family to norway thornton believes germanys war on home schooling is just a part of europes war against christianity this is a battle to eradicate spiritual life from every person in europe to eradicate spirituality and christianity from the culture he said and the unfortunate victims in this battle are the families who believe educating their children is their god given right

3799417 solar panels are usually very expensive and difficult to make so g24i chose a different route one thats somewhat comparable to photosynthesis the process by which green plants convert sunlight into energy g24is panel is also green and flexible just like a green leaf its advantage is that this makes it unbreakable so it can for example be folded around a post or moulded to a corrugated roof and not end up in anybodys way it delivers a little less energy than a standard solar panel yes but its about one hundred times cheaper
3799418 it actually provides very little light but the light it does produce is very bright picture it this way if you go outside when theres a full moon you can see everything around you but if you were to switch on a light metre it would register nothing there would simply be too little light for it yet at the same time you can see so much with this lamp weve imitated the effect of full moonlight its really turbo moonlight a boosted version of the light you get when theres a full moon
3799419 we intend to use the money to set up an initial pilot project in rwanda with african users what we dont intend to do is say look heres a new light instead were going to listen to what the people themselves actually want were going to make a couple of different versions and study the practical applications whether its easy to steal how reliable it is whats the best design for it to have and whats the best way to distribute it were also considering a form of micro financing
3799420 we are all agreed that we should first reach a ceasefire all sides can observe and that humanitarian aid needs to reach the stricken parties in the area as quickly as possible
3799421 we first need to ensure we extinguish the flames we can go on to discuss our relationship with russia and with georgia at a later stage
3799422 the idea was to ensure that we can always maintain deliveries to our clients but some of our clients increased their orders before the games began so they would have enough products in stock but now the games are here theres a lower demand for our products one we can meet from our existing stocks and that means the factory doesnt need to operate at full capacity
3799423 we use buses to bring our employees to the factory because the amount of traffic has been reduced those buses get to work earlier what that means is that during the two weeks of the olympics our people can set off for work later because the buses are leaving later because theres less traffic on the roads
3799424 we made sure we took a lot of extra precautionary measures but actually if you look at how everythings turned out in practice our business hasnt suffered and on a personal level were all enjoying the olympic games now that theyre here

3799426 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3799427 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3799428 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3799429 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3799430 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3799431 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3799432 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3799433 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3799434 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3799491 the market is coming down today due to the decoupling after the stronger dollar and lower oil price driven rally over the last week

3799496 i appreciate the medias concern about the fate of farmers who have taken loan from private moneylenders according to our information most of the moneylenders operating in rural areas dont have the licence for the same hence their moneylending business is illegal and farmers are under no legal or moral obligation to repay these illegal loans
3799497 i will write to all the state governments asking them to protect farmers from the moneylender in fact state governments should create a separate machinery to look into farmers complaints of coerced recovery of loans at the taluka level also workers from political parties including the ncp should come forward to protect farmers
3799498 out of the rs 60 000 crore package for loan waiver the government will have to provide only rs 40 000 crore as under the prime ministers package loans of rs 20 000 crore to farmers have already been rescheduled and banks will be paid this rescheduled loan over the next three years
3799499 and with institutional credit line being opened for these farmers we hope the country will see a major growth in agriculture production and productivity
3799500 if every medium and large farmer of the country comes forward to avail the benefit of the one time settlement scheme the size of the package can go up to rs 65 000 crore
3799501 but to stop them one has to ensure adequate institutional credit and irrigation through this budget the upa government has tried to address both these issues
3799502 like the middle class which has vivid loan options available the farmers of our country do not have such variety of loans available for them the government is considering ways and means to make consumption loan available from financial institutions
3799503 it seems as if only the media is gearing up for the election perhaps you people dont realise how difficult it is to contest elections we still have around 15 months to go and we are not at all in a hurry to face the elections

3799517 with us england going to the champions trophy and me leaving after this game for the one day series this will be my last game for notts for the season
3799518 it was going to be a decent pitch and a test of whos got the better seamers and better batting
3799519 we were really thinking it was going to be a tough match but one we could definitely win after playing them a week ago and dominating a lot of that match
3799520 but unfortunately its turned out its going to be a struggle to get a proper game of cricket in

3799524 jessica was well developed and every guy in high school wanted her and practically every girl hated her
3799525 jessica put on a brave face but it was a campaign of terror that just devastated her a nasty clique of girls constantly spread rumors about jessica and one that spread like wildfire was that she was gay
3799526 when i got the call i was a bit shocked
3799527 originally i thought geoff was only calling me for the england lions games but obviously he added the full squad as well which was very good
3799528 its been a bit too quick for me the last two weeks my mind has been going 100 miles an hour ive been overwhelmed that ive been picked ive just got to keep doing what ive been doing for notts and hopefully it will work for me i cant wait to go and play for england
3799529 it doesnt matter who you are playing for the boys here will do their best to beat to beat south africa and make sure they need to work on a lot before the one day series
3799530 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
3799531 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
3799532 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
3799533 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
3799534 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3799666 calling upon the elected political leadership of our community to bring to a swift close the saddening saga which has been mayor kilpatricks failure to fulfill his responsibilities as the mayor of detroit this call is not taken lightly but only after every reasonable effort has been given to the mayor to address the charges that have been leveled against him
3799667 we believe that it is not humanly possible for anyone to adequately address the demands of family the city of detroit and his criminal defense simultaneously we urge the mayor to see first to the needs of his family and his own defense
3799668 this drama is causing national and international damage to the reputation of our home for our common good this must come to an end
3799669 this mayor while the legal system must address any alleged legal offenses is certainly in violation of the public trust extended to him as the elected leader of this city while mayor kilpatricks freedom is his right the office of mayor is a privilege and a responsibility it is now a privilege which kwame kilpatrick no longer deserves we have been considerably patient enough is enough mr kilpatrick needs to leave office immediately either by his own volition or by his involuntary removal by those who have the political capacity to do so
3799670 strongly urge the mayor to step aside and address his problems his issues are holding the city hostage

3799721 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
3799722 once you start the process of fat synthesis from fructose its hard to slow it down
3799723 the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body
3799724 its basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence
3799725 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to low fat diet foods are often those that contain the most fructose
3799726 decreased signaling to the central nervous system from 2 hormones leptin and insulin
3799727 the long term consumption of diets high in fructose is likely to lead to increased energy intake weight gain and obesity
3799728 the potential for weight gain from increased fructose consumption may only represent one aspect of its metabolic consequences

3799874 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3799875 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3799876 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3799877 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3799878 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3799897 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3799898 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3799899 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3799900 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
