30042 it sure is oh hold on im just being told that this is called an alley oop yes that is easier to say

30047 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi im asking you to regulate it officialize it tax it legitimize it
30048 i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
30049 big white p on a yellow license plate that says the driver works for an accredited photo agency
30050 a law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject keeps everybody safe and misbehavior becomes accountable
30051 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
30052 regulating the paparazzi wont bring an end to modern day media coverage just as the newly enforced hands free law hasnt stopped people from talking on cell phones while they drive
30053 8 being very lucky and sounding like part of the phrase
30054 we want to show our support for the olympics a century old dream for china and take part in a major event
30055 a century of the olympics a century long dream a century long prayer for happiness a century of perfect marriage

30058 jason bay is the most underrated player in the national league
30059 he can do many things well ive always enjoyed watching him he can run play defense hit hit for power hell grow on you when you see him every day because hes a quality all around player
30060 no question about that but jason can do a lot of things that manny cant do he brings a lot to the table
30061 i could feel our big pane of glass in the lounge moving
30062 we have invested heavily to build a performance based local centric advertising platform for local resellers and advertisers that integrates online and call based advertising products and services at scale
30063 our goal is to accelerate the adoption of local online advertising and to deliver the highest volume of quality local leads
30064 we invite the help of americas boating public to assist the coast guard in keeping our waterways safe and secure

30068 its under the legal amount but thats all one can say about it
30069 endosulfan is the worst pesticide still in use in new zealand
30070 we are conducting more tests on new zealand capsicums and cucumbers its costing a lot of money but were very concerned
30071 if the consumers are eating them id be more worried about that than the below level endosulfan
30072 if the environmental risk management authority or the government bans endosulfan as they are being called on to do new zealand growers will have a clear marketing advantage over their australian competitors
30073 this is where endosulfan has been used very occasionally in a controlled way
30074 specifically one target specific application was undertaken approximately 14 months ago to reduce the worm population within the marked sports field lines at oliver and a amp p parks
30075 even the milk we give to babies is not free of endosulfan
30076 early exposure of our children to hormone disrupting compounds may play an important role in new zealands high incidence of breast cancer to continue allowing the use of this chemical on our crops fruit and vegetables sports grounds and parks is unbelievably short sighted and harmful
30077 people doing the other work have in most cases been much more important in the process than i have actually been
30078 a lot of memories came back there would have been over a thousand names in that heap of paper and each one always had an unpleasant story attached to it
30079 your professionalism your intellect your humanity has been well commented on by a number of people
30080 if there is an economic slowdown no one bothered to tell the mobile device buying public
30081 in particular consumers in emerging markets in asia the middle east africa and south america shrugged off inflation fears to sign up as mobile phone users these healthy gains in net subscriber additions are stimulating replacement and upgrade sales in developed markets handset purchases tended to be flat but those consumers who did purchase dug deeper and paid out more for coveted higher end handsets and smart phones
30082 there is admittedly turmoil in the global economy but the mass markets fascination with getting the latest and greatest handset shows no sign of abating
30083 the level of penetration of high powered rfics into the mobile wireless base station market right now exceeds what most observers would ever suspect
30084 it is a major force in the device market for base stations these parts are shipping in the millions the accepted wisdom about high power rfics simply no longer applies
30085 one major supplier controls so much of the rf high power amplifier rfic market that there is a risk of permanent market distortion
30086 were hopefully going to get some tips about getting signed and in blenheim theres not many opportunities to play your own music

30095 this book is a work of fiction no characters are based on real people whether living or dead any resemblance to a real person is pure coincidence anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar
30096 all characters in this book are the productive of the authors imagination any resemblance to a real person whether living dead or someone in between is purely coincidental except for david bowie hes real however he is used in a fictional context and not intended to resemble the real david bowie entirely
30097 all chuck norris jokes are used in a fictional context chuck does not really use sharon stone as a chew toy for his dog

30113 im just saying he was good for steve at the time molitors taken away what hes learned from that man and added a component to it with stephane larouche thats taken him to another level
30114 hes happy to have all this stuff behind him and hes just chomping at the bit to put on his best performance on august 29 at casino rama
30115 he hasnt really fought a lot of tough guys but i always worry about the mentality of an undefeated fighter because he doesnt know how to lose
30116 we have an agreement in principle with warriors boxing the promoters of caballero to fight molitor here at casino rama on november 21st
30117 hes still a young man and hell be a better person for having gone through it
30118 im very proud of him how hes handled it ive taken him around and had him apologize to the broadcasters and the casino its a very humbling thing especially for a professional fighter he did it like a man and their respect for him is growing so that helps the healing process along
30119 i have to share this with the people i love i cant do this justice with my description i have to take photos
30120 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
30121 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
30122 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
30123 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
30124 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
30125 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
30126 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here
30127 a new dimension a lifestyle shopping center that we dont have in york county
30128 i think it would be a shame to lose it for the sake of another big box store
30129 it hasnt been the immediate success that id hoped for and the investors had hoped for when we opened
30130 im not sure why the creator felt this is a necessary project but i enjoyed my visit and would recommend it to anyone traveling through the area theres a snack bar and picnic tables so you can eat drink and bask in presidential history

30133 the global homeland security business is now worth an estimated 200 billion more than hollywood and the music industry combined
30134 is to use the latest people tracking technology thoughtfully supplied by american giants like ibm honeywell and general electric to create an airtight consumer cocoon a place where visa cards adidas sneakers china mobile cellphones mcdonalds happy meals tsingtao beer and ups delivery to name just a few of the official sponsors of the beijing olympics can be enjoyed under the unblinking eye of the state without the threat of democracy breaking out
30135 every supposedly liberating tool of the information age cellphones satellite television the internet was transformed into a method of repression and control
30136 the global corporations currently earning superprofits from this social experiment are unlikely to be content if the lucrative new market remains confined to cities such as shenzhen like everything else assembled in china with american parts police state 2 0 is ready for export to a neighborhood near you
30137 i regret to inform dodger fans everywhere as well as my boss frank mccourt that i may have screwed up here a bit
30138 when red sox gm theo epstein told me that we could steal manny by giving up dodger prospect andy laroche i was so ecstatic that i forgot to confirm mannys last name upon further review of the contract i signed it seems that i gave away laroche not for manny ramirez but for
30139 i am truly sorry and apologize for any confusion i may have caused
30140 when theo told me i was picking up a three tool player i assumed it was ramirez
30141 still im hoping that man e faces alternate human robot and monster faces might give our lineup the flexibility it needs to adapt to game situations

30146 if you are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
30147 in the last race we didnt find the performance level we expected
30148 since then we have understood what the reasons were but its not something i want to explain i feel we have solved these problems now thanks to a lot of hard work from everyone in the team both in jerez and in the factory because of this i think we can expect to have a very different weekend here in hungary that doesnt necessarily mean we are going to win because we are up against a mclaren team that is very strong at the moment but at the very least i think we can be very competitive here
30149 it is very easy to say that mclarens are the
30150 they have obviously done a good job in the last two races but to some extent they were helped by conditions that did not suit us so well before the last two races they were getting criticised for not performing and that is how this sport works in that the balance can change quickly there is still a long way to go in the championship and i know we have a good team which is in the lead in the constructors with me and kimi second and third in the driver classification it is all very close and things can change very quickly as a team we are all one hundred percent motivated to do our very best this weekend and in fact from now on until the end of the season only then will we know who did the best job comparing this point of the season with the same time last year we are in better shape now so we do not need to over react to the situation and change the way we work during a season you can have great days and bad days so the important thing is to stay focussed on our targets without taking notice of what the media is saying about us we have been pushing very hard on the car development front trying to bring as many new developments to the car as possible
30151 for the moment kimi and i are very close on points
30152 if later in the year one of us has a lot more points than the other then maybe it will be time to see what we do but that is not yet the case so we continue to work in the same way
30153 on the grounds that femas actions are arbitrary and capricious an abuse of discretion and contrary to law without observance of procedure as required by law and unwarranted by the facts

30160 el gobernador creo que contest la pregunta y ah lo empezaron a abuchear entonces para mantener en control a los muchachos que hicieron la pregunta los trataron de sacar hubo un forcejeo creo que con la escolta
30161 comenzaron a insultar y a lanzar improperios inmediatamente la producci n decidi sacarlos se hizo como se hubiera hecho con cualquiera
30162 la escolta cuya funci n es proteger la integridad del gobernador sac a los muchachos del estudio y hubo un forcejo estas tres personas aseguran que fueron agredidas por la escolta del gobernador ellos se resistieron a que los sacaran
30163 falso le faltaron el respeto al gobernador y la producci n les llam la atenci n y el propio mantenedor del programa hizo expresiones en c mara
30164 esperamos que bajaran los humos y salimos sin problema la gente incluso aplaudi al gobernador

30167 con esa propuesta se comienzan a hacer otras gestiones como lo es la b squeda de fondos para realizarlo pero no quiere decir que el proyecto se va hacer tal cual es la idea de la cual se va a partir
30168 existen mecanismos procesales para realizar vistas publicas sin la necesidad de q los cuerpos est n en sesi n ellos lo saben
30169 no voy a convocar la extraordinaria hasta que el pa s no sepa qu es lo que ellos est n dispuestos a aprobar
30170 cuando ellos digan qu es lo que est n dispuestos a aprobar si cumple con estos dos principios que el alivio sustancial sea para la clase media y que se proteja el empleo de los empleados p blicos que se diga de d nde se va a financiar entonces yo convocar a a una extraordinaria
30171 la ltima vez que hicimos una reforma contributiva bajo esta legislatura ellos se negaron a llegar a acuerdos con la rama ejecutiva la rechazaron echaron al zafac n el proyecto que yo le envi y lo que se aprob es lo que ahora todo el mundo critica que es el proyecto de ellos esa es la iron a

30177 i dont think that was a very fair judgement for him to make or the choice of words on his part were pretty poor
30178 you can smell that dump all the way from topeka
30179 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
30180 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
30181 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
30182 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
30183 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
30184 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
30185 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
30186 we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
30187 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population
30188 i cant be caught thats one thing i cannot be caught im too advanced and too smart
30189 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
30190 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
30191 we might have to bring him along a little slower in spring training but everything looked good
30192 i think at the end of the day they didnt feel as comfortable maybe going forward to finish off the trade
30193 its something i think at the end of the day we may have been able to get the player but it would have been at a very very steep price
30194 i dont know if that would have helped us going forward as opposed to maybe setting us back a little more
30195 we got some hits on barajas but we didnt get any on zaun
30196 i believe we still have a shot at the wild card
30197 but i dont intend to mortgage the future if we were a game behind in the wild card right now i would say well im prepared to risk something but im not prepared to give up some of the gems we have that weve developed over the last few years for this type of shot
30198 if its possible to make roy a blue jay for the rest of his career we would explore that for sure

30201 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
30202 this changes what you see and how people interact socialize and communicate
30203 to me that was the standout of the whole iphone deal
30204 we believe that over the long term the subsidized iphone 3g will drive increased sales volume and revenues among high quality data centric customers
30205 the 199 price point should be a big hit with consumers
30206 this is going to bring in a whole new demographic
30207 its a no brainer that if you bring down cost more people will buy it
30208 hell start his rehab and hopefully hell be back with us for the dallas game
30209 all i know is he works hard to get back hell do everything he can

30211 en t rminos comparativos uruguay ha obtenido ndices relativamente bajos de corrupci n pero esto no quita que no exista
30212 en el tema aduanas la corrupci n es un problema mundial no es exclusivo de uruguay
30213 es una actividad que se presta para la corrupci n porque hay mucho dinero en juego
30214 estos episodios de corrupci n est n asociados a una estructura estatal muy vieja que facilita este tipo de acciones il citas si la aduana tuviera mecanismos giles y eficientes si existiera mayor tecnolog a ser a mucho m s dif cil para los funcionarios cobrar esas coimas
30215 desde tiempo inmemoriales existen pr cticas que no se han podido erradicar
30216 dentro de ese 50 hay un gran porcentaje que no comete actos de corrupci n pero los conoce y no los denuncia y por eso tambi n es culpable
30217 muchos funcionarios est n convencidos de que es algo el soborno a lo que tienen derecho es incre ble pero es as pero claro que hay aduaneros que de ninguna manera aceptan ni un peso de coima
30218 en este caso los funcionarios admitieron el cohecho y est n pagando por eso todo el mundo habla de que los aduaneros piden coimas pero hasta el momento las denuncias se han manifestado a trav s de los medios de prensa los ciudadanos tienen mecanismos para realizar las denuncias correspondientes cuando un funcionario act a fuera de la ley eso hasta ahora se ha constatado muy poco
30219 el gobierno ha demostrado su intenci n de empezar a combatir estos niveles de corrupci n
30220 depender de la eficiencia del sistema judicial y del gobierno de la capacidad que tenga la comisi n de notables de investigar y destapar los casos que se presenten

30222 like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
30223 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
30224 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games
30225 the ioc cannot sacrifice the olympic ideals in the name of harmony with its host city

30232 voy a llevar un equipazo tevez s seguro voy a llevar a los mejores y agregar a alg n muchacho nuevo que no haya sido citado recientemente todos se merecen oportunidades
30233 you find that there are many people who are depending on this person who are looking up to this person and who see this persons success as their own success
30234 as you go up the ladder its not always easy to simply say to them ok now im in this new position
30235 a lot of players get in trouble because they want everyone around them to lead the same lifestyle
30236 you buy this big house for people and they no longer want to drive the low end car to go with the big house so the big house leads to the big car to the better clothes to the better restaurants and stuff its a snowball effect you see how guys live
30237 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
30238 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
30239 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
30240 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
30241 having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
30242 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
30243 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
30244 we seem to be in the midst of a perfect storm leading to more bankruptcies high levels of debt high energy and raw materials costs and weakness in the u s economy
30245 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
30246 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
30247 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
30248 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
30249 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
30250 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
30251 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
30252 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
30253 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
30254 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing
30255 theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
30256 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
30257 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
30258 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
30259 conservatism has branced off into a very snide nasty divisive brand of politics without any real thought
30260 by the way you probably should read it to find out the ideological origins of your current political beliefs
30261 bush has never tried to make the presidency with absolute power
30262 to vera just like a good martini strong chilled and slightly bitter
30263 thanks for the typical liberal arrogance condecension and outright dishonest bullsh t dave its predictable
30264 drooling pshychotic hateful lie filled etc liberals and democrats are one in the same theres no f cking difference anymore
30265 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
30266 i will not have this debate trivialized by their excuse for their failed policy
30267 and when you win the election you win the majority and what is the power of the speaker to set the agenda the power of recognition and i am not giving the gavel away to anyone
30268 drooling psychotic hateful lie filled totally biased baseless uncivilized fact free rants
30269 no simulation has ever gotten to the point of identifying this important stage in the birth of a star
30270 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
30271 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
30272 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
30273 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
30274 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
30275 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
30276 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
30277 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
30278 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
30279 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
30280 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
30281 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
30282 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
30283 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
30284 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
30285 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
30286 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
30287 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
30288 we shall find peace we shall hear angels we shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds
30289 we shall find peace we shall hear angels we shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds
30290 some say the path we take is guided by fate or unseen forces
30291 he didnt seem to be an axe murderer or anything
30292 little did i know that it would change my life
30293 every once in a while you ask yourself what am i doing
30294 you cant just walk away its in your blood its what you know its what you are no matter how hard you try you het sucked right back in youre in for life and sometimes that feels like an eternity
30295 it is almost impossible to say how much father leopold loved the madonna the tone of his voice when he spoke of her the light in his eyes when he looked at a picture of her cannot be put into words at all you would have to have seen him in order to comprehend something of the ardent love for mary in the heart of this capuchin
30296 during his assignment at the friary in thiene near vicenza in the years 1906 to 1909 father leopold often helped the lay brothers humbly with the household chores washed the dishes cleaned the cells and set the table since his soul was turned constantly toward god he wanted them to pray during their work especially the litany of loreto at the invocation cause of our joy he interrupted his work lifted his eyes to heaven and remained for a while in this attitude as though enraptured once a confrere asked him father leopold why do you interrupt your work at this invocation of the litany of loreto and raise your eyes to heaven at that he exclaimed o madonna the madonna the cause of our joy then he remained looking up to heaven for a long time his face beaming

30343 mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy requiring nothing but abundant non toxic natural materials
30344 the key component in nocera and kanans new process is a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water another catalyst produces valuable hydrogen gas
30345 a catalyst is a chemical compound that acts to speed up a reaction but in the process is not itself changed therefore the catalyst at the end of the reaction is free to act again to assist another reactant through the reaction catalysts work by lowering the energy barrier between the reactants and the products
30346 so it probably requires much less electricity than traditional electrolysis
30347 with todays announcement mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy
30348 with a goal to make the large scale deployment of solar energy within 10 years
30349 i start with the problems because other than those the d3 simply blows away any dslr nikon has previously produced im almost tempted to say that you can shoot at any iso up to 1600 at any camera setting sharpening jpeg compression etc with impunity
30350 this camera looks big feels big and produces big images of outstanding color and detail i should emphasize that the color this camera captures is very accurate and even the finest of details are clearly visible with high quality optics what that equates to is picking up more of the textures to things
30351 iso 6 400 is normal use it all you want without any excuses i know of no other digital camera that can do this here are some crappy party snaps made in almost no light at iso 4 000 the d3 did a perfectly fine job even if the color of the lighting didnt cooperate
30352 okay so there is no perfect camera at least ive never found one there were a few things i didnt like about the d3 the first was the menu hierarchy though the d3 is not menu driven like some cameras it still took me a while to learn how to navigate through an extensive array of menu items to find and change even basic things however after using the camera for about two weeks the functions and features i habitually use started to fall into place so this wasnt so bad after all
30353 nikon leads in low light capability not a great lead but none the less it leads rhis review compares popular canon cameras and even the d300 in head to head low light iso sensitivity test shots
30354 if you are looking for a camera that is perfect for optimized for sports news and wedding photography the d3 quite possibly is the perfect choice because of the superior method and outstanding high results that can be achieved with the d3 it literally redefines low light and indoor photography
30355 one of the things this camera offers that makes it a must have camera for serious photographers is full frame sensor offering wide angle and depth of field lens performance like a 35mm film camera very nice sports and photojournalism is the primary target market but wedding photographers who regularly find themselves in low light will find the d2 perfect bottom line is everything about the d3 is breathtaking and that includes the price tag
30356 this camera is big and heavy another glitch is the lack of firewire and as the reviewer indicates usb 2 0 is not as fast as firewire on the plus side this camera uses power very discriminately and for such a big camera it handles remarkably well also the auto focus does a superb job even in low light and low contrast situations
30357 with all its power the reviewer felt it could use some kind of built in flash if nothing else to fire off remote units another item is the beautiful lcd and that it would be really nice if the d3s lcd would swivel which a lot of photographers would appreciate since it would allow odd shots last but not least is too bad it does not have a sensor shift image stabilization system and nikon expects everyone to by the vr lenses
30358 if we look at the iso range that would comfortably deliver consistent worry free images then on the d3 it would be in the 200 to 800 range its clear this a well built fast and responsive camera from nikon about the only negative items so far is the afs 70 200mm f 2 8 vr lens autofocus likes to have hard edges to get a solid lock and the inability to active a grid in the view finder is annoying
30359 after being deeply committed to shooting strictly canon for years to this reviewer it appears nikon now offers features and functions that are above canons many of which translate directly into increased production efficiency nikon has sent a challenge to canon with the emergence of the d3 and d300 that their dominance in the pro digital market is over
30360 live performance photography has its own uniques set of challenges low light and fast moving subjects can challenge even the most sophisticated photographic tools one speed bump encountered was nikons decision to reposition the manual control readout traditionally the read out was along the bottom of the image area however the manual read out on the d3 is now displayed vertically on the right side of the image area
30361 in the d3 nikon has provided photographers with a superb imaging tool and we enjoyed reviewing it a beautifully designed piece of equipment like this makes you want to keep taking pictures and allows you to record better images than you ever have the menu system is intuitive and anyone who has used nikon slrs will quickly feel at home
30362 as the latest in a long line of professional dslrs i didnt expect the d3 to present a poor handling experience and it doesnt but there are a few minor irritations first like the d2 and d1 series cameras before it the af ae lock button on the rear right hand side of the camera is not replicated in the vertical format instead if you need it the af on button must be reassigned via a custom function second i have never liked the rubber on rubber feel of the front control dial in nikons d2 series cameras and now the d3 the rear dial stands proud from the metal body of the camera and clicks positively into position as it is turned but the front dial barely projects from the rubber lip of the handgrip and i sometimes found myself rubbing the top of the grip wondering why the aperture wasnt changing
30363 as i wrote a little while earlier based on initial impressions of the d300 and now their first full frame cmos camera the d3 nikon is now back in the iq game canon has enjoyed a deserved reputation for high image quality especially at high iso but now with the d3 nikon has upped the ante producing a camera that appears to offer lower noise than canon at least against the flagship 1ds mkiii and higher available speeds as well
30364 a unique virtual horizon indicator appears aircraft style during live view and even shows up in the optical viewfinder while its useful in some situations we found other features far more appealing among our favorites hdmi output that allows you to play back images in hdtv resolution and the remote control and live view on a computer using supplied software thats something any pro whether in the studio or on location will find useful if not indispensable
30365 now the bottom line is would i buy this camera actually i pulled out my amex card three times and asked nikon to sell it to me and three times they declined to me it really was that good but as i stated earlier i am predisposed to like nikons
30366 so what are my impressions first of all color accuracy has been greatly improved when i used the d200 to capture a water spring in the wood the whole image took on a green tint due to the sunlight reflecting off green leaves with nikon d3 the colors are much more neutral this is also true for the nikon d300 which also has the new scene recognition system apparently this is more than just a bit of marketing fluff and actually works
30367 predictions have come true with the introduction of the fx format new moniker created by nikon d3 which features a 36 x 23 9 mm 12 1 megapixel cmos sensor as well as a vast array of new features which absolutely raise it another notch above previous single digit nikon dslrs important headline improvements include high sensitivity support by default up to iso 6400 with 25600 available as a boost option 14 bit a d conversion a new standard image processor a new shutter new auto focus sensor focus tracking by color nine frames per second continuous dual compact flash support dx lens support albeit at lower resolution and a 3 0 922 000 pixel lcd monitor which it has to be said is lovely
30368 why no sensor stabilization nikon seems committed to lens vr indeed they produced slides showing how much better lens vr is than sensor vr at the d3 launch and introduced the remaining exotic telephoto lenses in their vr versions and its at the telephoto end that the differences become more pronounced curiously the 24 70mm didnt have vr a critical mistake as far as im concerned as nikon continues to send mixed signals to users will there be a vr mid range zoom that covers fx at some point there should be if nikon continues to stand by lens stabilization but the fact that we havent got it yet is a silly marketing mistake and one that leaves them out of parity with canon
30369 i think a lot of agencies are facing these issues
30370 with the economic downturn its made it more difficult for everyone an agency such as ours depends a lot on transportation and with the transportation costs increasing it has obviously significantly increased our costs
30371 our income comes exclusively from my wife the kids mother
30372 ive been having trouble finding a job because i was spent time in jail right now coming here its actually a necessity for the kids
30373 theyre having a hard time feeding themselves and their children especially with the gas prices being so high and all the other utility costs increasing as well many people dont have the extra money to buy the food
30374 well give them whatever we can but if theyre unsatisfied or we dont have enough to give them well direct them to another food pantry
30375 thats 15 000 that we dont have for food now
30376 there was also a 6 percent increase in individuals served in june 2008 compared to june 2007
30377 this trend could indicate that we may continue to see a rise in the number of individuals we will serve through the remainder of 2008
30378 the rising cost of heating and also electricity could also have an effect
30379 if the number of people using the food baskets continues to rise we might be a bit more worried
30380 were having trouble feeding everyone too theres just not enough money for us to supply everyone

30391 who though he was in the form of god did not count equality with god a thing to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross

30475 girl youd better get your red head back in bed before the morning
30476 a world series for me would make this trade successful
30477 hes one of the best no 4 or 5 hitters in baseball
30478 it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
30479 ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively over the next two months
30480 and this gives us the chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch
30481 eli eli my god my god even you have forsaken me
30482 because of your unfailing love even yet i will trust
30483 its an exciting time for our organization our fan base and the whole baseball team
30484 hes a personality but it really is warped by his pure baseball skills
30485 he is one of the best hitters in baseball and certainly one of the best hitters ive seen in my lifetime
30486 it is the manager the coaches and the players that make this possible we see them pointed in the right direction and starting to come together as a team and really working hard in each and every inning of every game and that is really when you want to step up and help a team i feel very good about our team
30487 im not concerned with his behavior until he makes me concerned there is no downside to getting him this is huge
30488 hes a public figure and theres a lot of things out there some fabricated some real
30489 i talked to his agent scott boras and he said hes thrilled to be coming we dont control anybodys behavior we just expect him to be respectful
30490 i guess well find out manny being manny could mean hell hit a lot of home runs drive in a lot of runs and be a clutch player for us i think we know what were getting if hes a distraction its probably minimal we couldnt turn away from that bat that presence in the lineup and that hell be a free agent at the end of the season
30491 with his world series experience his charisma his electricity when he walks into that clubhouse tomorrow theyll know who he is
30492 having played with manny obviously what he brings to the table offensively is special
30493 i love manny as a person as well that being said the dodgers were a team we were going to have to compete with down the stretch and that hasnt changed
30494 hes going to go up there and give quality abs every time and he makes a quality team that much better
30495 i think the way our offense has been swinging lately i think gm josh byrnes had the confidence that wed be all right our pitching is one of the best in baseball and if we can throw up four or five runs weve got a pretty good shot to win every game im not disappointed at all that we didnt do anything
30496 i like the addition that we made in adding jon and im sure they like the additions they made with respect to casey blake whos an outstanding player in his own right and manny
30497 obviously its going to help their lineup but its really not a concern of ours
30498 i really dont think stuff like that affects us weve just got to play our game
30499 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven

30517 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
30518 this first section contains the days of creation this is the only section which due to it being the first does not start with the generations of showing that the world was not generated but was made in an act of creation having established that the number one represents god and his sovereign nature let us follow the thread further into prime numbers numbers which have no other known significance in themselves and are prime numbers divisible only by themselves and one are also stamped with this theme of god first jesus first recorded words properly put into perspective his highest priority and also what ours should be and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business this is especially relevant when his last words are remembered it is finished also of note is jesus first words in his ministry after he was baptized by full immersion by john the baptist in the river jordan he received the holy spirit he then went and prayed and fasted in the wilderness for 40 days at the end of that time he was tempted by the devil his responses to satan at that time are the first words he spoke in his ministry thus jesus not only used the word of god the resist the devil but also showed that the first place any ministry should start is with gods word when the angels sang to the shepherds to announce the birth of jesus they sang first they sang glory to god before good will toward all men in all of these first words god is given priority hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord it does not deny the trinity but it absolutely excludes the possibility of another lord it excludes therefore all idolatry interestingly the term one lord occurs only five times in the bible firstly in deuteronomy as mentioned above and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him one lord one faith one baptism the sum of the verse numbers that these occur in is 4 9 29 6 5 53 which is a prime number which representsm potential children of god the sum of the chapter numbers in which these occur is 6 14 12 8 4 44 which is divisible by 11 a prime number which represents revelation one god also has similar numeric features it occurs seven times in the bible have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus 19 thou believest that there is one god the same value we saw earlier in the sum of the chapter values for the term one lord it can be seen that the two different words sum to 13 and 31 respectively a nice pattern in itself also the digits of the sum of each word sum to four almost a preview of the total sum being 44 this is the exact same number that we saw for the sum of the chapter numbers of table gt this is a prime number just like the the sum of the verse value for the occurence of the phrase one lord this phrase is stamped with the significance of prime numbers and the meaning of one the first occurrence of the word one in the bible is in the phrase one place which has a numeric value of 199 a prime with no other known significance and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so the hebrew word ra ah meaning to tend a flock to pasture it to associate with as a friend or often shepherd this word is used in the most famous of psalms psalm 23 this word occurs in the bible 173 times in 144 verses 173 is a prime number with no other known significance thus god puts his seal on it as indeed the lord is my shepherd friend does sum up our relationship with him it is also of interest to note that the 144 verses in which it is found is 12 times 12 this number is also used symbolically in revelation of the lords perfect government so this word shepherd friend is also associated with gods perfect kingdom to come any perfect government must entail a relationship between the ruler god and his people in which the peoples best interests are sought ie they are shepherded but also there must be love friendship so not only does this word sum up our relationship with god but also the qualities which are required in a perfect government words that only occur once in the bible are especially stamped with gods sovereign authority and power such words can be especially instructive for example he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death of salvation is the hebrew word moh shah oth which is only used this once so god puts his especial stamp on it for salvation is from god and none other we cannot earn it or achieve it ourselves no statues of wood stone metal or any other material can give it to us no philosophy or belief can win it for us only god hs wbt teb oo saw which means destruction is only used once and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab this single use of this word speaks of a fulfillment of the purpose of god the house of ahab kings of the northern nation of israel had been very wicked in idolatry and leading the nation to worship false gods thus after prolonged warning from several prophets god removes them from ruling the nation and brings punishment upon the house however ahaziah was the king of the southern nation of judah at this time he and his family that went with him was slain because they were with the evil house of ahab when judgment fell galatians 3 24 tells us that the old testament is to teach us the lesson that we should not keep company with bad influences could not be clearer d b a ob dawn which also means destruction is only used once 6 for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred 7 then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews in this instance queen esther is pleading with the king for her people this passage also shows the completion of gods purpose haman the enemy of the jews was completely defeated and the things he had planned for the jews was done to him by using this word only once the great emphasis is placed upon he who wrought this salvation god for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart kritiko

30538 it hit me in march that this thing was going in the right direction and then we hit spring ball and i was really impressed with how our team played
30539 even from then to now this is a different football team a stronger football team i see something special in this team
30540 its a little different for me at center taking snaps with three guys
30541 be we are confident in all three guys they all do something different it just means that the returning starters need to increase our leadership roles and make sure we gel as a unit
30542 i go by the weight room and i hear the weights clanking and the chalk flying
30543 players are talking about accountability and guys are fighting to take responsibility i like how they are talking about their teammates about the team not about themselves when stuff like that starts happening it can explode in a big way
30544 we need x ramirez does x well so well look past y and z
30545 we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it i guess you could say in all fairness if hes going to replace somebodys reps hell take those first team reps
30546 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
30547 its strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say it a month from now im going to be ready its my job to be ready
30548 because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where he is
30549 thinking about if im more comfortable than anyone else is not an efficient use of what i want to be doing right now in camp
30550 its about preparing to come out here and play well and then playing well
30551 theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough
30552 hes competitive hes resilient now if he can play quarterback thatd be great
30553 you want to be out there getting the reps but im just trying to get mental reps back there and be ready to go today
30554 its going to happen in fairness ive got three guys competing for it
30555 just because of the way reps are its difficult to be 100 percent fair with reps but were doing the best we can
30556 theres no gray area get your feet in or youre out it also gives the defensive player an opportunity to make a good play you dont have to quit on something
30557 if his efforts make it so theres only one foot in then his efforts count hes rewarded for them i think thats the way the game ought to be
30558 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud
30559 when youre facing good pitching you need to find a way to score were getting shut down too frequently
30560 the dynamic is not like that as far as our personnel
30561 other teams ive been on they do that it hasnt happened here yet it doesnt mean guys arent frustrated it means we go about it in a different way
30562 he has to be careful theres a molina behind the plate
30563 the reason were not disappointed is that this is an ongoing process
30564 will not be an impediment to what we need to do
30565 well meet with the staff friday and see how we introduce the younger kids and who has to take a backseat because of that
30566 they all have a good relationship with the ballclub and the manager and us in the front office
30567 they understand the program they dont have any problem with the path were following
30568 to take the pressure off bochy and to make sure everybodys on the same page he understands that
30569 we did all the work and there was no interest
30570 ive enjoyed my years for the giants ive been waiting for an opportunity like this where they say ok youre going to be one of our lefty guys youre going to help us out of jams in the seventh or eighth and help brian wilson out thats something i wanted here to have the team youre with be committed to you is a boost
30571 but early on i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt take the last couple of days to figure out that wasnt going to happen that type of player wasnt moved so that should tell you what kind of climate it was
30572 weve had a lot of changes but i think the new team will be a lot of fun
30573 we have so much talent and everybody is so young
30574 with the contract comes bigger responsibilities and you are expected to do more
30575 i knew we had a really great relationship with the warriors so i thought sooner or later we would get the deal done
30576 of course there was a little bit of stress because other guys were signing and i still didnt have a contract
30577 i told my agent that i wanted to see all of the opportunities but my first priority was the warriors
30578 makes it so much fun to play basketball and the warriors have really taken care of me for the last four years
30579 hes doing a good job he just needs to keep getting better
30580 were trying to improve some of his technique and just trying to have him be more of a physical football player
30581 even when i got picked up as a free agent i was being negative with it i was still mad
30582 i dont think louis has ever been scared of a challenge
30583 he works hard its not surprising not one bit hes doing well i expect him to continue to step up to the challenge
30584 you just could see the difference with velocity that hes just not letting it go which is fine
30585 hes such an explosive player that its something we have to look at
30586 we were having quite a few conversations and some of them were initiated by other teams who wanted our young players
30587 some of the names you saw traded some of those calls came to us
30588 we really want to see it through and stay disciplined
30589 we have a real foundation and were willing to bite the bullet the process is painful and were not going to do something to make everyone feel better for the next couple of weeks we have a long term plan which is why we made the trades we did before the deadline
30590 my focus here on out is to finish strong finish these last two months in a positive way
30591 and also put up numbers that are indicative of where i believe myself to be you cant focus on what youve done in the past because you cant change it
30592 in the bullpen if i pitched poorly i always felt better if i had a day off to see what i was doing wrong
30593 lets say you have mechanical problems and youre not throwing a certain pitch the way you want to if you dont have time to make the adjustment you go out there two or three or four outings in a row you get your butt kicked whereas as a starter you have a few days to look it over and work on it
30594 i mean i want to get back out there obviously because my last outing wasnt what i was hoping for
30595 but its not like im sitting in here saying oh my god i cant wait to pitch again when my time comes my time comes
30596 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
30597 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
30598 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
30599 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
30600 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
30601 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
30602 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
30603 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
30604 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
30605 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
30606 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
30607 no matter what i do to change the way i look on the outside it never seems to affect how i felt on the inside
30608 this will be a great thing for springfield regardless of whether youre republican democratic black white hispanic asian
30609 its a great thing for springfield because hes a historic person
30610 you know make shit look good for the man put on a big show
30611 yesa sihr rightsa awyz sihr you wahns me to sahng fer yah sihr
30612 what kind of soldier crews the worlds fiercest killing machine
30613 one must kiss a few frogs before prince charming comes along
30614 the only limits to the possibilities in your life tomorrow are the buts you use today
30615 weve seen call growth from 30 000 to 60 000 in the last year
30616 forty percent of those calls have been about food thats the first sign of a problem
30617 as these programs run out of resources at the end of each month we just get busier and busier
30618 some of these people are working and theyre still living in poverty
30619 if its a choice between food and a minor problem theyre going to pay for the food
30620 but that minor problem can turn into a major one
30621 we can help but that just means you dont have to worry about the house that doesnt give you more income
30622 theyre just one or two paychecks away from going under
30623 what we are seeing is a higher request for food because our agencies are serving more people
30624 we put 15 percent more food out in the community this year since this time last year
30625 that average is pretty typical around the country for second harvest food banks
30626 hunger is the real issue and the crux of the issue is unemployment the need for good jobs
30627 the faces of hunger will surprise you the new group of folks who are reaching out and in need look like you and i they go to church on sunday they pay taxes they have no obvious signs of poverty for the first time the images of hunger are starkly different than what they have ever been
30628 we are getting letters from our middle class donors saying that they are not able to donate as they once could
30629 theyve made a lot of money and its a heavy hit when they find a comparable job and itll be half of what they got paid these people have been down at the factory for 20 years and they dont know how to look for a job
30630 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
30631 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
30632 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
30633 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
30634 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
30635 for every one water district complaint we get eight nine or 10 more sewer district complaints
30636 ill be right in line behind you trying to get it changed
30637 theres no doubt in my mind that well be back in october
30638 the volume of complaints havent been as high on this project as other projects
30639 unfortunately any type of infrastructure work is an invasive process
30640 this is probably going to wrap it up for a while
30641 story has rapidly been making its way around the nets
30642 in the end hipsters are sold what they think they invent and are spoon fed their pre packaged cultural livelihood

30660 id like to give you a piece of my mind
30661 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

30679 we cannot hide the fact that we need new players at everton
30680 everybody knows it i know it the players know it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts it is okay getting fit but you have got to be able to play better at the moment there is not enough competition for the players to realize that if they play poorly they will not be selected

30725 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
30726 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with
30727 i think this article has been done quite deliberately to stir things up and i think its totally unacceptable behaviour from a senior cabinet minister
30728 i always named em the berkeley girls and no one picked any girls but me i picked em all always

30731 i never bothered with the directors who did the dramatic parts of the pictures most of the times id never even see them
30732 they did their job and i did mine of course my sections were more expensive we once figured out they cost about 10 000 per minute on the screen and people yelled about that but i hollered em down
30733 i never did much advance planning id get all the people on the set before me and when they were all there thats when id start to think and go to town
30734 i only used one camera i didnt need any more than that i knew what i wanted if you use four cameras the editor gets to choose the shot he likes they didnt do that with my pictures they went together the way i wanted them to go together

30738 indestructible as the memories we have of them those killed
30739 a lot of families ideas were included in the design its very different the stelae remind me that prior to july 7 these 52 people that died stood tall in this world the material itself is as indestructible as the memories we have of them we wanted a proper memorial so we have taken our time
30740 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for loss victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of the curious visitor
30741 for a sunscreen to be as effective as possible it should really protect against both uvb and uva rays

30743 no i dont have a boyfriend im looking but im too busy but im 16 and i like to go on dates and i have crushes and stuff

30754 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable
30755 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
30756 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
30757 we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars

30788 you have a wonderfully beautiful face mr gray dont frown you have
30789 through her novels morrison forces us to acknowledge that the lives we often overlook and rarely celebrate are perhaps the lives we can learn most from
30790 beloved s plot is constructed to mirror the way that memories unfold
30791 the plot emerges in nonlinear fragments as different characters remember their experiences and share them with the reader and or each other
30792 another fascinating connection between morrison and the work of artists can be found in the way that she uses her gifts to
30793 morrison has stated that using multiple narrators in her fiction enables her to give credibility to various and significantly different voices which replicates the complexity and polyvocality of african american culture itself morrisons incorporation of multiple narrative voices also challenges western patriarchal white linear plot driven narrative and replaces it with circular nonauthoritarian narrative
30794 morrison offers an alternative to western individualistic ideologies by rewriting the typical hero quest myth as such she insists that those ideologies do not work for african americans
30795 the works of toni morrison reflect more than her mastery of folkloric figures most especially that of the trickster her stories also exhibit her ultimate skill of author as trickster fiction and folklore the novels of toni morrison trudier harris discusses morrisons novels as a series of reversals inversions and subversions of well known folktales in the rhetorical strategies of the folk narrative according to harris in the bluest eye morrison inverts the lesson of the ugly duckling and in sulla she subverts the traditional fairy tale structure and song of solomon she reverses the odyssean journey in tar baby she subverts details of snow white beloved she reverses and undermines the traditional ghost story however perhaps more important is the fact that morrison does not simply blur the common designs of certain story patterns instead she continues to confound and confuse in true trickster fashion the familiar narrative models by replacing the european american archetypes with african and african american folkloric paradigms in doing so morrison completes a perfect act of duplicity and becomes the ultimate author as trickster figure
30796 there is no figure in the bluest eye who ascends from darkness and emerges into the light who finds enlightenment and chooses it over the shadows as one of platos prisoners ultimately does what we do fine in pauline breedlove and the sugar brown mobile girls is the same unwillingness to step outside of the cave that platos prisoners display when they are given the opportunity an unwillingness driven by fear and the need to exist within the false albeit familiar construct because it is easier to do so because it is comfortable and safe rather than emerge from the cave and faced the painful light of the sun
30797 this is why we thought what we thought this is why we said what we said this is how we drew our conclusions
30798 there were a few countries that got it long before 9 11
30799 the jordanians egyptians uzbeks moroccans and algerians always understood what we were talking about it was ironic that pre 9 11 we had more success in getting help within the islamic world than elsewhere
30800 the focus on iraq by senior bush officials predated the administration paul wolfowitz douglas feith and richard perle were among 18 people who had signed a public letter from a group they named the project for the new american century calling for saddams ouster it is often forgotten but regime change in iraq was also the explicitly stated policy of the clinton administration and was the goal of the iraq liberation act passed by congress in 1998 100 million was appropriated to the state department for the express purpose of seeking an end to saddams regime americas promise to topple saddam remained the law of this land from halfway through bill clintons second term right up until us troops invaded in march 2003
30801 for many in the bush administration iraq was unfinished business they seized on the emotional impact of 9 11 and created a psychological connection between the failure to act decisively against al qaeda and the danger posed by iraqs wmd programs the message was we can never afford to be surprised again
30802 in looking back there seemed to be a lack of curiosity and asking these kinds of questions and the lack of a disciplined process to get the answers before committing the country to war and in hindsight we in the intelligence community should have done more to answer those questions even though not asked one of our senior analyst subsequently told me that the impression given was that the issue of should we go to war had already been decided in meetings in which we were not present we were just called in to discuss how and occasionally the how will we explain it to the public there was never any doubt of the military outcome but there was precious little consideration that im aware of about the big picture of what would come next
30803 feiths team it turned out had been sifting through raw intelligence and wanted to brief us on things they thought we had missed trouble was while they seem to like playing the role of analysts they showed none of the professional skills or discipline required fieth and company would find little nuggets that supported their beliefs and seize upon them never understanding that there might be a larger picture that they were missing isolated data points became so important to them that they would never look at the thousands of other data points that might convey an opposite story
30804 trained analysts would ask questions like what is the source
30805 policymakers have a right to their own opinions but not their own set of facts
30806 because of the impending vote on the use of force scheduled for early october a production process that normally stretched for six to ten months had to be truncated to less than three weeks
30807 we allowed flawed information to be presented to congress the president united nations and the world that never should have happened
30808 it was a fateful moment in the story of art when peoples attention became so riveted on the way in which artists have developed painting or sculpting into a fine art that they forgot to give artists more definite tasks
30809 a land owner do i look like a land owner
30810 my passion combined with my talent is going to beat the hell out of your uniform red sash and title
30811 sit over there on your throne and weep because when i am through wiping this floor with you no one is going to remember you or your amp
30812 were sorry wed love to publish you but youre too young tell you what well hold on to this exact manuscript until your eighteenth birthday then publish it as is is that alright
30813 vibe of the city currently is kuselan and we at big 92 7 fm would like to make our on air and on ground offering highly
30814 theres an outside chance we could see some showers and thunderstorms in the middle of next week and that could knock our temperatures down a bit
30815 but for the next several days at least we expect temperatures near or above 100
30816 we have dew points in the 70s which is very humid any time of year but something we usually dont see this late in the summer
30817 last weekend was very warm but quite dry in the afternoons
30818 its a punishment issue so if you prove the hate crime aspect it just ramps up the potential punishment
30819 the bottom line is if there is some reason like the persons prejudice causes them to commit the offense thats going to come out anyway
30820 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
30821 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
30822 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
30823 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
30824 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
30825 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
30826 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
30827 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
30828 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
30829 this government has finished its mission irrespective of who will head kadima
30830 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections
30831 the reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge
30832 a degree of durability to the gains we have made
30833 single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe
30834 in fact as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
30835 there clearly have been worrisome trends in afghanistan in recent months in particular
30836 these jobs cuts are going to translate into hardship in communities all up and down the state and this sends the message that these employees arent as valuable as other employees
30837 were a quasi state institution but structurally and formally were independent of the state
30838 were looking at our situation and our operation and even though these things dont directly apply were looking at the things we have to do to address our own budget and help the state
30839 knotted polka dotted twisted beaded braided powdered flowered and confettied bangled tangled spangled and spaghettied
30840 history repeats itself because no one was listening the first time
30841 budget cuts and political shifts cost us our support system at the old place
30842 when our a amp r guy lost his job we knew it was time for a change a few years ago that mightve been a scary thing but its a brand new world out there now for bands like us we no longer have to rely on a big record company to make things happen and thats exciting we made this record without the pressure of having to write four smash hit singles hanging over our heads and that was liberating of course
30843 there are a few songs on the album that could do really well on radio
30844 theres a sense of energy and excitement about us that we havent felt since we released our first album
30845 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
30846 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
30847 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
30848 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
30849 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
30850 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
30851 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
30852 i said when i stood for elections that i also will vacate my seat when the need arises to allow anwar to be in parliament
30853 i once presented a paper on being an accidental politician

31119 the construction of the reactor began with the laying of a pipeline for fresh water from the nearby karoun river to the site and the expansion of the al zarqan power station
31120 the construction works seem to be routine and do not arouse attention but the tight security around the region is what arouses suspicions regarding the nature of the work
31121 whether its modeling clay dolls or crayons a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar
31122 rather than putting players in the shoes of luke skywalker or frodo baggins were giving them the opportunity to be george lucas or peter jackson as they create their own universe from scratch

31125 just relax crabbs its just a plume of nice healthy steam and not a noxious cloud of cyanide death vapor
31126 the secondary listing on the hkse was essentially designed to support our longer term growth ambitions and achieve greater liquidity and exposure throughout the asian region
31127 while regrettable the decision to postpone the listing will not impact on our capability to advance our organic growth strategies or our current business operations
31128 we are confident that once global market conditions improve we will be better positioned to consider re activating the secondary listing strategy particularly in addressing the appropriate cash liquidity pricing and strategic benefits
31129 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

31138 so they were kind enough to give me a little bit of time off im definitely coming back later in the season
31139 i wanted to come back on this show for my fans the fans were dedicated and loyal and i thought we owed it to them for the original cast to come back i think its amazing the more cast members they can get from the original series the more people are just psyched they have jennie garth they have shannen
31140 the shannen get was huge for the fans because shes the original shes brenda walsh

31164 you go tell the widow lady to trim those hedges
31165 what we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world and i would say from our estimations britney and paris came in second and third
31166 so from our perspective we have in this ad the three biggest celebrities in the world
31167 foolishly perhaps im going to try again to pry some info out of hucka d tonight weve agreed beforehand that no money will be involved right hucka d
31168 there was a technical move which has since been reversed that caused quite a stir and that move was reversed because there was a desire to take a look at this database as a whole
31169 it has been pointed out that there are multiple inaccuracies in the database so essentially we wanted to reset back to where we were take a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the database how the database itself functions as well as the interagency process that supports the database function
31170 we think that we should not react excessively to what one u s government agency does
31171 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
31172 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
31173 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
31174 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
31175 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
31176 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
31177 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
31178 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
31179 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
31180 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
31181 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
31182 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
31183 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
31184 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running
31185 mr fukuda said that he wants to reshuffle his cabinet today
31186 the prime minister asked us for our cooperation in the reshuffle

31188 instead of going to other communities for specialized care walla walla residents now have first class rehabilitation services here in town and we expect that residents of other southeastern washington communities will come to park manor for that type of care as well
31189 were going to nationalize bank of venezuela im calling on grupo santander to come and start negotiating
31190 they wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan banker and as head of state im saying no sell it to the government to the state
31191 were going to recuperate bank of venezuela were very much in need of a bank of that magnitude
31192 therell be headlines in the spanish press is chavez harming spain to undo the diplomatic relations weve just mended
31193 political events in venezuela pose an increased risk the venezuelan government might nationalize or in other ways intervene in the operations of our venezuelan subsidiary
31194 must show repentance and regret before we can share communion with them
31195 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
31196 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
31197 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
31198 disregarded biblical authority by violating clear biblical teaching aginst homosexual behaviour
31199 how can we go to holy communion sit in bible study groups and share meals together pretending that everything is ok that we are still in fellowship with the persistent violators of biblical teaching and of lambeth resolutions

31205 it is exciting knowing that no matter what i am safe and secure in a financial sense i dont have to worry about the dental and medical expenses
31206 with healthcare expenses in civilian life they are expensive and i dont think i would be able to survive or afford it without the military or what i am getting now
31207 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
31208 nowadays the equipment works well enough that we do have time to look up at the eclipse
31209 its very dramatic and awe inspiring when the darkness suddenly comes thats why thousands of tourists go to see
31210 i said no ill buy it from you whats it worth well pay it
31211 its looking like a negative development i dont see why the banking sector needs to be under the purview of the public sector
31212 the private sector does a much more efficient job of running that type of business
31213 the government sees logic in expanding its network of banks in the country and santander may benefit as it has a buyer and can exit
31214 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
31215 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
31216 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
31217 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
31218 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
31219 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
31220 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
31221 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
31222 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
31223 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
31224 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
31225 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along
31226 im not so sure those gains are sustainable exports are likely to slow with the slowdown in europe and japan
31227 consumers used the stimulus check more for basic necessities as opposed to more discretionary items
31228 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
31229 but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
31230 we think that for the families of the victims this is the right move
31231 we think it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner
31232 we got rid of cronyism kick backs and sweetheart deals
31233 watch i can do a handstand pushup with no problem

31237 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side

31250 you dont mess with peoples children their pets or their private property
31251 check their gardens and make sure its their garden and not their cousins down the round i can take you anywhere and show you somebody elses garden and say theres my garden but thats not the point thats not the situation of the farmers market its supposed to be your garden and some of them who are selling at the market dont even have a garden
31252 the intent of the farmers market has always been to have a market for locally grown produce and vegetables that can be sold at the downtown park
31253 were actually looking at some other cities to see how they have theirs set up
31254 it was a good idea that we exchanged some ideas and were going to put a committee together to come up with some rules and regulations for next year that will give everybody an opportunity to express some of their views in the next few months and get something in place im excited im hoping that the farmers market will actually grow even more the ones in pendleton and anderson are actually doing very well so maybe we can look at what theyre doing and help ours a little bit
31255 essentially we would like to bring the farmers together and have them help us help them to regulate the process
31256 of course the other thing that we want to look at is having a public hearing sometime in the fall after the growing season is over so that we can begin to discuss what steps will be taken for next year

31275 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
31276 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
31277 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
31278 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars

31365 i work as though making the movie by hand i give all i have in filming
31366 some potters exert the utmost effort not only in the function but also in color and pattern id be happy if viewers question how the film was made rather than why and if its dubbed the korean film with the best action sequence rather than a perfect entertainment
31367 at the time i was arrogant to believe that i would be the first korean director to produce a western but later i discovered that directors shin sang ok and lee man hee had already mastered the genre
31368 there is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesnt matter who gets the credit

31415 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
31416 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
31417 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
31418 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
31419 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
31420 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
31421 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
31422 having icc language in the text sends the wrong message to a man who has presided over genocide
31423 it is likely that we will discuss this deferral request again over the coming months
31424 but the focus now should be on renewing the unamid mandate and showing solid council support for what is a very different mission in the field
31425 we hope this resolution will get the broadest possible support
31426 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
31427 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties
31428 we must respect the africans au they play a good role in sudan as part of unamid so we have to respect their position
31429 actually the language in that particular paragraph is quite weak

31431 we send a report on the quantity and number of consignments dispatched from the factory every month to the circle inspector of the area we supply only to purchasers who have a license issued by the government once the trucks leave our premises it is not our concern what happens to them it is not our business anymore the onus is on the purchaser to keep track of it
31432 the companys owners are of the opinion that they supply detonators to distributors or dealers across the country these detonators only initiate an explosion they are not explosives in themselves once the distributors buy from the company what they do or to whom they sell afterwards or what happens next is not the companys responsibility
31433 i figured two of the main problems of future cities would be pollution and over population
31434 with more vehicles needing more places to be stored i came up with the concept of a folding car

31447 barack obama has finally pulled the race card against john mccain and the republicans
31448 you know mr i transcend politics has finally tacitly admitted he is just a typical politician by accusing those who dont like him of being racist
31449 is it arrogant or above obamas station for him to meet with the chairman of the federal reserve if im not mistaken he is a sitting united states senator and also the presidential candidate of the democratic party such meetings are actually the norm

31459 this game is very important not only because we hope to be involved in the tri nations in the future but because each time we play south africa it is very important
31460 we are looking forward to playing more tests in the year and this is a very good opportunity for us if you play against the best it will make you improve and that is the reason we came here for this very exciting and important game
31461 we have brought the best players we have some of them have recently finished their seasons in europe and we have a lot of expectations we expect a good game
31462 i think we are on the brink of a first generation artificial pancreas

31465 it was a hard decision i know im doing it for the right reasons
31466 this collaborative research is important because of its potential to lead to a possible cure of pre eclampsia in pregnant women using the animal model we were able to prevent pre eclampsia in pregnant mice
31467 i dont want to overstate the implications but this is clearly a very exciting time for all of us involved in the research we plan to focus our efforts in expanding this research to pregnant women
31468 the final number of tickets to be sold lets say 50 000 for arguments sake
31469 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
31470 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
31471 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
31472 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
31473 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
31474 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
31475 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
31476 red black brown and green positive solutions to the issues of poverty immigration and environmental destruction
31477 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
31478 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
31479 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
31480 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
31481 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
31482 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
31483 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
31484 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
31485 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
31486 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
31487 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
31488 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
31489 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
31490 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
31491 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
31492 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
31493 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
31494 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
31495 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
31496 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
31497 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
31498 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
31499 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
31500 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year

31515 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
31516 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
31517 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
31518 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
31519 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
31520 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north
31521 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line
31522 agree to a verification protocol that included the plutonium program the highly enriched uranium activities and the proliferation efforts
31523 if verification must cover the three big issues that certainly makes it more difficult than if you only focus on plutonium
31524 all future negotiations with north korea except those specifically dealing with nuclear disarmament

31569 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
31570 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
31571 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
31572 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy

31575 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
31576 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
31577 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
31578 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio

31593 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
31594 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
31595 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream

31650 i have really good recall i dont remember the conception but i go very far back
31651 i went to p s 247 which was a very good experience
31652 where i sort of was brought into song and dance
31653 i used to like to listen to the radio and i still love going to the movies when i can but by the time i was 8 or 9 i was extremely withdrawn and inhibited and shy and repressed and thats when i was taken to this song and dance school
31654 i thought well since i didnt know how to communicate if i memorized routines perhaps i could communicate through that which i had memorized
31655 in 1978 when i was working in england on a fairly good remake of one of alfred hitchcocks masterpieces the lady vanishes the great angela lansbury said to me at the studio at pinewood i never know where the camera is
31656 and i thought thats hard for me to believe and hard for me to accept i always know where the camera is in relation to the lighting and in relation to rehearsing and having to hit marks
31657 i was able to find my first objective relationship with the camera on my third film which was bob amp carol amp ted amp alice with paul mazursky
31658 i couldnt be objective with mother and father i couldnt be objective with myself i had no objectivity whatsoever that was abstract to me
31659 but then in bob amp carol amp ted amp alice each of the four characters had a fantasy my wife was played by dyan cannon and her fantasy was that every man in her mind wanted to dance with her so paul mazursky and the late actor and screenwriter larry tucker staged a scene on a soundstage at columbia with 400 male extras and me and dyan cannon
31660 i gave me problems the camera would never lie to me it simply reports where i am it was my first objective relationship
31661 i always know where the camera is but its my friend
31662 he just gave me so much room and i was able to really really start to play
31663 when we were doing the long goodbye bob altman and i talked about it we felt that we ought to do one every other year
31664 theyve given me the rights to one story that im interested in

31692 it was a great practice we had good tempo and had great spirits we got a lot done
31693 its good we have some good competition there every day you come out here you see one guy that flashes we have a number of preseason games to put our defense in but im looking forward to seeing them in live conditions weve got some great effort weve some young guys with a lot of potential well just wait and see
31694 its very similar to what ive done with tom nalen what ive done with dewayne robertson here is a veteran guy that came off surgery and missed six practices in a row and didnt complain and didnt want to miss practice but i thought it was the best for him
31695 hes going to have an mri today to just check everything out and make sure if there is something we have missed according to head athletic trainer steve antonopulos its not the knee its beneath the knee the bursa sac is causing him a little irritation right now he doesnt think its anything serious but to prevent anything we are going to check it with an mri and hope itll be fine and just a little bit sore
31696 he is having a good camp he has his weight back anytime you are in your third year you feel a lot more comfortable the terminology the system the supporting cast and the defenses most quarterbacks in their third year want to go out and prove themselves
31697 it really doesnt i wasnt promised anything all i was promised was the opportunity to compete and im still competing i have nothing but respect and admiration for john lynch i was sorry to see him leave i was learning a lot for him and he was a great veteran leader and i am going to miss him around here
31698 i was surprised he didnt say anything to anybody obviously he and coach mike shanahan spoke it was new to us all yesterday i wish him the best and i hope that he lands somewhere else i wish him nothing but success
31699 not yet when i came on my visit we spoke about some things coach shanahan is a guru he knows everything if he needs me i am available he knows that i am sure as the games get closer and week 2 starts to arrive im sure i will have a sit down with the offensive coordinator
31700 i have always tried to carry myself as a leader and was in san diego in this secondary with champ bailey dre bly and hamza abdullah im able to focus on doing what i need to do to help this team win games and win the division and ultimately get a chance to win the super bowl i am more than willing and capable of being a leader and that is what i plan on doing
31701 hes got a pretty strong arm every time we got ready to play him our coach said stay deep this kid can throw a hundred thousand yards hes got a strong arm hes got a cannon im impressed by him i am impressed with brandon marshall brandon stokley and eddie royal those guys dont drop anything the hard catches they make them cutler is doing really well i am impressed by him too
31702 im a little shocked me playing with john for last four years and how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he is doing on the field it stinks that he cant play every down but that is what he wants to do he wasnt happy with his role and i am behind his decision all the way whatever he wants to do i would love him to stay but every guy has to look out for himself
31703 not to this extreme i didnt see it coming i knew that he was uncomfortable with his role and that is pretty much all i knew
31704 he was almost like a fourth linebacker out there hes great in run defense and his leadership most of all is going to be missed because he is a proven winner and a hall of fame player and guys look up to him and respect him for what he has done and what he can do
31705 well you dont have to yell at anybody to be a leader i think people misunderstand you can just lead by example i think the way you lead on this defense is by just working hard everyday and when guys get down you pick them up i know myself that i have to step up a little bit without john here because john was always the guy who would say something there are a lot of guys that lead by example look at d j williams we expect everybody to pick themselves up and gather around him
31706 he was very frustrated this would have been his 16th year i cant say that i have been there but he just came off of a pro bowl year it is not like he cant play when a team is ready to move on and go in a certain direction that is the way you have to take it jerry rice didnt finish in san francisco but he was a great player
31707 well not really i think the hardest thing is that we will just miss his presence and what he brought to us i think we have a lot of time to adjust so i dont think it will set us back too much
31708 they are smart players and they have been around so we expect them to fill in and play as well as we expect them to
31709 im getting used to it looking back at 05 we probably have 10 12 guys on the whole team its nothing new it is just the way this business is
31710 we need to step up losing a player is all part of the game you have people and you lose them its the responsibility of everyone else to step up and fill that role whether it is on field stuff or leadership i think we have enough guys to do that
31711 it caught me off guard a little bit its hard to say im surprised what is it like 15 years its not just a flat out surprise but the fact that he has been here five days and just disappeared caught us all off guard
31712 i didnt sense it he did a good job covering it up its hard to imagine he wasnt a little frustrated being the perennial pro bowler that he is to come in and not be an every down guy im sure hes frustrated
31713 i dont think its one person i think we have a lot of great leadership one of the best things about this team so far is that people have been self motivated and leading themselves it makes for a better team we havent had any situations where we needed a guy to step up by yelling and screaming to get us in line everyone is here everyday and ready to work
31714 i would like to start out by saying im going to pull a brett favre on you
31715 i want to thank mike president and chief executive officer pat bowlen and the broncos organization
31716 i would just like to thank everybody for the great years here i wish this team all the best i really like the feel of this team and thats what made this an extra hard decision this team has a great chemistry to it and i think they are going to do very well i wish them i wish mike i wish everybody the best
31717 no its not just based on playing time i dont know exactly what that will be ill talk to a team i think i have a pretty good gauge of a situation that would be right ill consider my family ill consider everything if one presents itself it feels good and it feels like something where i would put forth the commitment then i will do it because i only know one way of doing it and thats full speed ahead so im going to make sure its right but well see well start that process
31718 i havent had a lot of conversations with the guys in the locker room it all kind of happened suddenly i left yesterday i had an opportunity to go out with about six of the guys hopefully they came back to the meetings on time and in good shape we had a nice time just kind of celebrating our time together and wishing them the best of luck i wanted to explain to them what had gone down ill have an opportunity in the coming days to talk to my teammates
31719 first of all i dont regret the fact that i spent my whole offseason working for this i put my whole heart into it it was a different situation for me i had somewhat come at peace with even the role of the playing time and thats a hard thing for me to do im a prideful guy and it was hard for me to let go of that but i at some point had a level of comfort and peace with that but it went even beyond that as i was telling my wife linda the one thing ive always done is when i stepped in between those lines is ive always enjoyed myself in the locker room ive always enjoyed myself when ive stepped in between the lines and the last couple days at the practice field i wasnt doing that and thats when i knew that something had to change
31720 i came to grips with not being a full time player i had reached some level of peace but it probably was that it just wasnt sitting right like i said i just knew that you know why prolong the situation i felt like for the teams best interest and for my best interest it was time to make a change
31721 i tried to take an approach coming into camp this year where i was just going to enjoy every opportunity to get on that field and every second i think it was different in that for the last 14 15 years being a starter in this league the expectations for the organization are that i would play at a pro bowl level and help carry a team this year i think i was treated very fairly but there really were no expectations so it was a different scenario for me i think i handled it well i prepared myself got to an incredible fitness level and i was ready to play but like i said it just ultimately wasnt the right situation
31722 i spoke to john after our last ota day and after our last ota day john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
31723 i sat down with john and i said hey you would be our first team safety but you wouldnt be in our nickel package
31724 then after tuesdays practice he came up to me and he said hey mike i need about 24 hours to think about what i want to do he said right now not playing nickel and not playing dime i am kind of losing concentration with what you are doing even with your base defense therefore its kind of tough for me i said hey take as much time as you want he came back to me and said i am the kind of guy that really had to be involved ive been a pro bowl player and a consummate pro and i kind of dont like the role that i am in now and it is very tough on me i said john you have given everything to this organization that a guy could give and if you think it is not going to work out here on an every down basis and you would like to look at other opportunities i am not going to stand in your way you have given me too much and you have been too much of a pro i dont think that i have ever been with more of a pro then with a guy like john lynch he is the type of guy you look at in the future and say hey this guy could be the president of the united states he is that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to let him look at his options whether its football or retirement whatever he wants to do he has given everything that he could give in the four years that he has been here when a guy is not happy it doesnt feel right and i want to give him his opportunity to do what he thinks is right for his future
31725 to be honest with you when i talked with him after ota days you could see how important it was i talked to john and told him the reason he is so successful is because he has that mindset he wants to be out there every down but if he is not he would be such a great teacher toward the young guys but wouldnt be happy missing first and second down what has made john a hall of fame player is that he has that type of mindset he wants to play every down and i cant blame him and im not going to say that he cant i had to give him an honest evaluation of where we were and what we thought as a staff one thing you never do to a veteran player is never lie to them you tell them exactly where they stand so he can see his role if he accepts that you can do some good things and if he doesnt then the best you can do sometimes is part ways if you are honest with each other than you have a chance for good things to happen and i wish him well
31726 you never find players like john lynch from a leadership standpoint they are one in a million like i said he has everything you look for in a person and in a player it is tough but we have some excellent players that are out there right now that are competing like i said to john its hard for me to say that you are not going to be the starter in our nickel package i said i have to be honest right now you would not be he believes that there are other opportunities out there for him if he gets one i will be rooting for john as long as he is not in the afc west if it is i will be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play him
31727 i think that john is probably the most well rounded person i have been with
31728 well like i said thats the reason why he is a hall of fame player the reason why he has been to nine pro bowls the reason why he has won a super bowl the reason why he was the leader in tampa and a four year captain here he is a true pro but you have to be honest with him to and you have to tell him how we see his role what has made john the type of player he is is that he believes that he is the type of player that is going to go out there and do it and i am not going to question it that is where we are at right now
31729 what i have to do is tell him what i see his role is i told him that is where i see you now i said at the end of training camp you could be first team safety and on the first team nickel or you can be a second team safety and a second team nickel i said i dont know the only way we are going to know is how you practice on a day to day basis and as you get older we are all evaluated that way and that is what i have to do with these players with these players you come in the locker room every day i dont care if you are a first round draft choice a pro bowl player i dont care what you have done we are going to go out there and compete every day and the best people are going to play when you have a guy like john who is year in and year out when you lose a guy like that it is tough i shared that little bit of conversation that i shared with you with our players last night any time they lose a guy like john they deserved to know exactly the conversation i had with him a month or month and a half before one thing about john lynch whatever he does he is going to be the best at it
31730 john is such a pro that you really dont know i knew john would never be happy not playing every down and that is what has made john john some players accept the role that if they are not starters then they can work with the young guys and build up there game and some guys are so competitive they want to be out there every down if not they would rather retire and i respect that or they want to go on another team where they can start do that john is going to check out his options and the great thing about it is that he is healthy and he has worked his rear end off you have a guy that takes care of himself as i said i wish him well
31731 any time you are not on the first unit you dont get a lot of reps its like the second and third players dont get a lot of reps you are evaluated every day with you base packages as well as your nickel packages john shared with me he said hey i have lost some of my concentration even in our base packages i have made some mistakes that i never make just because i was thinking of the disappointment of not playing all the time i understand his thought process and i respect it and that is one of the reasons why we released him
31732 rod has been gone for awhile he got hurt and i think everybody knows his injury and when it occurred even though retirement was just a short time ago rod hasnt been with us his presence hasnt been out on the field i think john said it best if youre not out there playing its hard to lead rod smith even though he was a consummate pro its hard to be a leader when you are not out there guys have to step up and take leadership roles we have a young football team and some older vets it will be interesting to see who will step up and take the leadership role
31733 it kind of is tough but the best thing to always do is be honest if you do that its always the right thing but by the same token john is such a damn warrior thats why hes been such a great safety and player in this league hes going to the hall of fame im sure thats the way hes played for 16 years and thats the way he wants to finish playing wherever that may be and i respect that
31734 obviously you cant replace the type of leadership the experience he has and the things of that nature we have some guys in there that are going for that position that are going in to do their jobs as well
31735 he probably started off in the otas not having as good of a grasp of the packages as maybe the other guys but after the last few days he has really come on hes doing some really fine things him and s marquand manuel they are both picking up their games and getting comfortable with the system
31736 right now i would say that would be the case he has excelled in that particular area when his playing days started with the san diego chargers we liked him from the very beginning watching him on tape
31737 i was kind of surprised that it happened however many days we are into training camp
31738 a surgical internship of the type we are hosting provides training that is the equivalent of a phd it takes just as much time and effort but provides a different pathway to high end skills
31739 make your way down the concourse to the white rocking chairs and get comfortable
31740 i wait for the lord my soul waits and in his word i put my hope
31741 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
31742 ive got and galore you want thing a mabobs ive got twenty but who cares no big deal i want more

31748 were trying to come to an agreement thats not only for this year but for years to come
31749 theres been constructive dialogue from both sides im cautiously optimistic well come to an agreement
31750 no because we generate in fact globally something like 60 70 of all the revenue and we share in that to the tune of no more than 14 if we were to sell our own rights globally exclusively wed generate a much larger number but thats not the way the olympic movement works we share
31751 it took me a long time to get over last year

31753 everything you did well in the first part of the season has to be taken up a level and you have to spend extra time studying and preparing because opponents now know what youre capable of

31815 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
31816 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
31817 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities

31885 literature makes us better noticers of life we get to practise on life itself which in turn makes us better readers of detail in literature which in turn makes us better readers of life and so on and on you have only to teach literature to realise that most young readers are poor noticers i know from my own old books wantonly annotated twenty years ago when i was a student that i routinely underlined for approval details and images and metaphors that strike me now as commonplace while serenely missing things which now seem wonderful we grow as readers and twenty year olds are relative virgins they have not yet read enough literature to be taught how to read it
31886 realism seen broadly as truthfulness to the way things are cannot be mere verisimilitude cannot be mere lifelikeness or lifesameness but what i must call lifeness life on the page life bought to different life by the highest artistry and it cannot be a genre instead is makes other forms of fiction seem like genres for realism of this kind lifeness is the origin it teaches everything else it schools its own truants it is what allows magic realism hysterical realism fantasy science fiction even thrillers to exist

31888 james is really suggesting that he has not formed his character that she is still relatively shapeless an american emptiness and that the novel will form her for good and ill that europe will fill in her shape and that just as these three waiting watching men will also form her so will we as readers they and we are a kind of greek chorus hanging on her every move two of the men lord warburton and ralph touchett will devote their lives to watching her and what james asks will be the plot that poor isabel will have written for her how much will she herself write it and how much will be written for her by others and in the end will we really know what isabel was like or will we have merely painted a portrait of a lady so the vitality of literary character has less to do with dramatic action novelistic coherence and even plain plausibility let alone likeability than with a larger philosophical or metaphysical sense our awareness that a characters actions are profoundly important that something profound is at stake with the author brooding over the face of that character like god over the face of the waters that is how readers retain in their minds a sense of the character isabel archer even if they cannot tell you what she is exactly like we remember her in the way we remember an obscurely significant day something important has been enacted here
31889 the day waves yellow with all its crops that is woolf from the waves i am consumed by this sentence partly because i cannot quite explain why it moves me so much i can see hear its beauty its strangeness its music is very simple its words are simple and its meaning is simple too woolf is describing the sun rising and finally filling the day with its yellow fire the sentence means something like this is what the field of corn on a summers day will look like when everything is blazing with sunlight a yellow semaphore a sea of moving colour we know exactly and instantly what woolf means and we think that could not be put any better the secret lies in the decision to avoid the usual image of crops waving and instead to write the day waves the effect is suddenly that the day itself the very fabric and temporality of the day seems saturated in yellow and then that peculiar apparently nonsensical waves yellow how can anything wave yellow conveys a sense that yellowness has so intensely taken over the day itself that it has taken over our verbs too yellowness has conquered our agency how do we wave we wave yellow that is all we can do the sunlight is so absolute that it stuns us makes us sluggish robs us of will eight simple words evoke colour high summer warm lethargy ripeness

31993 any parent knows the worst thing in the world is for something to happen to your kids
31994 they said there is no reason he shouldnt have a full recovery so we feel really really blessed
31995 this was one of my first auditions so i was really pumped and i was really excited to go for it

32008 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
32009 god there are so many moments that brought me back to my teenage years
32010 it happened all of the time like when hannah is crying hysterically after her boyfriend of two years breaks up with her and she believes that her life is over or when jake the geeky boy feels so self conscious at the school dance surrounded by the popular kids that he must flee from the room leaving his date behind or when hannah fights with her parents about wanting to move to california and become a filmmaker and they are firmly against it almost these exact scenarios happened to me at that age so i was constantly feeling like i was reliving my teen years
32011 i realized that didnt make me very happy many of the kids that i thought were my close friends turned out not to be very good friends
32012 so i ended up leaving the popular crowd and just trying to be myself at one point in my junior year i had a pink mohawk but even that wasnt really me ultimately i became more of the bohemian arty type like hannah and thats who i really was and still am today but it took all four years of high school for me to discover and then feel comfortable expressing my real identity
32013 i was looking for teenagers each from a different social group or clique and different economic background i was also looking for students that surprised me that undercut the stereotype or expectation for example megan is the popular super confident queen bee who seems to have the perfect life but in fact she is dealing with a painful family tragedy and enormous pressure to get into a certain college her life is far from ideal and she is a very complicated girl
32014 colin needed to get a basketball scholarship or he would not be able to afford college and his family then wanted him to join the military hannah was the fish out of water who needed to escape the midwest to feel like she could fit in megan needed to get into a certain college in order to follow the family tradition jake who didnt have any close friends needed to find a girlfriend so he could feel accepted and have the companionship he craved
32015 the town also had the best restaurants which turned out to be a godsend in the year to come

32106 at pixar the bottom line is the story that youre telling and pixar does not look at sequels as a financial plan we feel we have a relation ship with the audience and that they believe in each movie we put out we believe completely in every movie we put out if i can come up with a story that is as good or better than that first film then id love to return to that world but it would have to be story first

32111 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
32112 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
32113 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
32114 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
32115 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
32116 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
32117 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
32118 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
32119 its important because it tells us there is a risk in using just one model its quite true that you should have different approaches and methods it just makes the results more robust
32120 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military

32125 our preference is to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our flexibility
32126 the steep accumulation may not be obvious to investors one reason is the way apple accounts for iphone sales it books the revenue from each iphone over 24 months because the phones are sold as part of a subscription through at amp t t and other carriers but apple gets all the money as soon as customers buy so cash hits the balance sheet long before revenues show up a second reason is apple appears to be getting more for each iphone than analysts expected while at amp t and others charge customers 200 for the entry level model some analysts now estimate the carriers pay apple 500 to 600 a phone for the right to charge users lucrative service fees
32127 one radical possibility would be for apple to snap up content

32179 its not our intention to do any campaigning for or against any politicians
32180 its more just to have a little bit of fun around a contemporary issue that is of relevance to new zealanders because of the exposure it has received
32181 i want delegates to focus on the fact that there is only one poll that matters and that is on election day
32182 itll be a very strong message that there is no room for complacency the hard work lies in front of us and nothing should be taken for granted

32198 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong

32205 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
32206 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
32207 mr lutfi and mr spears have mutually agreed in private that no hearing or order is necessary at this time
32208 during the temporary conservatorship the conservators have the power to insure that lutfi will not harm britney anymore
32209 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
32210 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
32211 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
32212 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable
32213 i think we can win a super bowl with aaron rodgers
32214 but if brett came back and stepped on that practice field it would test my emotions
32215 he never misses a game sure he retired early he made a mistake he wants to play we went through 20 something years of different quarterbacks before brett rodgers looks good but all quarterbacks look good until they play a bunch of games
32216 i think bretts got another 20 games in him last year we were this close to the super bowl its hard to start over with a young quarterback
32217 if this were his first year thinking of retirement it would have been a different story
32218 but this is the fourth season and he went a lot further this past spring im sure youve seen the video of brett crying we all felt happy that he was going out on a high note now hes changed his mind again they had to move forward for not just this season but for the future
32219 a lot of people feel he may be thinking its the brett favre packers and not the green bay packers but no matter who you are theres no status like that the coach and gm have to go on with their plans
32220 ive watched him play and hes made some terrible decisions
32221 thinking he can get away with throwing off his back foot or into double and triple coverage as a 17 year veteran you should know better than that the gunslinger thing that means to me that hes lost the ability to control things
32222 most people like brett and think he gives us the best chance to win
32223 but theyre sick of hearing about it because the media has been beating them up with it for five years
32224 there are not going to be the fireworks that some had expected
32225 given the erratic behavior of microsoft with its constantly changing terms and scope of deal i wouldnt predict anything
32226 but there is clarity after settling the proxy contest we are getting a sense that our company is back on track
32227 yahoo and microsoft missed out on helping each other a great deal
32228 selling yahoo is fine but at the same time we are trying to negotiate a good deal for shareholders
32229 the board has to look out for what is right for the company

32232 nel periodo 2008 12 la produzione addizionale di elettricit solare ed eolica mondiale e quindi il contributo alla riduzione delle emissioni di gas climalteranti di queste tecnologie verdi dovrebbe essere almeno 4 volte superiore rispetto al contributo aggiuntivo netto del nucleare considerando anche la chiusure delle vecchie centrali
32233 considerando le tendenze dei prossimi anni afferma silvestrini si evidenzia come in valori assoluti vento e sole supereranno la nuova potenza nucleare installata
32234 nel periodo 2008 12 il nuovo eolico dovrebbe generare una quantit di energia elettrica pari a due volte e mezzo quella del nuovo nucleare mentre lelettricit del fotovoltaico dovrebbe raggiungere un quarto di quella prodotta dalle nuove centrali atomiche
32235 ive come all the way from california for this its going to be my 11th eclipse i try to see them all
32236 nowadays the equipment works well enough that we do have time to look up at the eclipse

32238 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
32239 in america you have the squeaky wheel gets the grease in japan we have the crying bird gets shot

32248 each and every one of you pulled over a million votes last night
32249 im so so grateful thank you so much judged and everyone
32250 i hate this book because i can read it because i am illiterate
32251 it is surprising how and why nepal tv allowed its transmission channel to be used by a front organization of ltte a terrorist organization banned not only in eu uk and usa but also in india
32252 its not about the one retailer its about what has been going on at olg
32253 a forensic audit doesnt answer the question about what the high priced management help have been doing at olg for all these years while this has been going on literally under their noses
32254 it can only be seen as truly independent if somebody else at least works with them and signs off on the terms of reference
32255 its one of those things that no matter the outcome you have to let it go
32256 you cant get caught up if we beat someone badly since they might be going through the motions and thats not what youre going to see later on its nice to get a pre scouting report of what youre going to see in beijing
32257 we werent at full strength then but certainly the players are thinking about it
32258 its just a basketball game at least were going to try to make it that way
32259 i played against all those girls many of those girls have expressed support for me which i really appreciate i have no ill will toward anybody on that team
32260 we can practice we can run through stuff but its getting out there and playing teams that have played together
32261 guarding the international game and having a little bit of that officiating is going to be nice as a warmup before the olympic games
32262 you get a feeling on how to guard people their moves i think its great for us to have that get a glimpse of players you know or you kind of know
32263 its an important piece in our process well have three days of practice one day of practice then we play a game keeping it in perspective is also important for us
32264 getting a look at australia and russia who we might not see until the olympic medal round is important
32265 the nice thing about going on the road is that we get away from it all
32266 i dont know paris hilton and britney spears but they are international celebrities so you know apples to apples
32267 i was upset of course but im going to keep on fighting it could be a blessing in disguise with the other organizations out there
32268 its like a three year deal with the the ultimate fighter and all
32269 i think they can release you whenever they want so yeah they kind of let me go
32270 i actually really dont know if it is i think its kind of funny because i definitely didnt make those comments to piss anybody off
32271 i thought the whole thing was blown out of proportion
32272 i just said what goes around comes around kind of meaning about the double standards not meaning anything bad i guess they kind of took it the wrong way but i didnt mean anything bad by it
32273 i dont know if the ufc is looking for an excuse to get me out of there or what the comments were nothing
32274 i wouldnt mind fighting for them again right now first things first is just to find another fight hopefully in a major organization and get back out there
32275 there should be something big in the next couple weeks about where im going
32276 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her shes doing a great job
32277 we consider this incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference conference usa office and the ncaa with the information
32278 i havent raced since the last day of the tour of italy and itll be good to get back into action
32279 ill have a tough time taking on the riders whove done the tour de france because their form will be better after hard racing in july
32280 above all the clasica is a vital test of my form in my build up to the olympic games and the tour of spain my big end of season objective
32281 it will be the first time ive ever ridden the clasica but i know its never easy
32282 im trying not to work myself up so much that im in the ufc
32283 i just really want to focus on this fight not necessarily being a ufc fight but just being another opponent
32284 im just really focused on the fight and my opponent as an individual and not really the big stage i think after this fight ill let it soak in a little bit that im actually a ufc fighter
32285 ive had my fun with the six fights in a matter of three months or four months and i realize that wasnt a normal mma schedule but it was a good experience and it was a great way to fight
32286 i went to a two year college a junior college
32287 i got my associates degree but i was definitely planning on going and getting a higher degree in criminal justice my ultimate goal was to be a police officer
32288 but if i was just focused on school it would take a while before i would start making money mixed martial arts wasnt in my ultimate plan but i knew that i was pretty talented in takedowns and wrestling i thought about the money it was definitely not expected
32289 being a police officer is definitely something i wanted to do but now that im into mma ive totally fallen in love with the sport and im starting to realize that i do have potential with my hard work to maybe one day be a world champion
32290 so i think my goals have changed a little bit ive definitely decided to put all my eggs in one basket and go with the mma game 100 percent
32291 a lot of people always say to me well youre already naturally talented to be fast and athletic
32292 it makes me laugh every time my older brothers actually an all american football player at syracuse university whos got really good pro chances my younger brother was a high school all american out of my two brothers the three of us im definitely the least athletic one and im the runt of the family ive always had to be the brother who has to work really hard to achieve even with wrestling in high school i was always a loser and i had to work extremely hard to be a winner
32293 i think i deserve this opportunity because i work really hard and i have a positive mindset on life and on my athleticism and who i am
32294 i just believe that i work so hard i learn so fast my brains a sponge for knowledge i love learning new things from anyone no matter how old they are or what they look like or whatever i just love learning
32295 i know ive made it here really fast but since february when i started training ive just been hungry to make myself better everyday i study a youtube video and just try to learn a new technique online im just hungry for knowledge so i think that i put myself in this situation and everything happens for a reason
32296 im definitely not planning on doing much laying on him or too much ground and pound
32297 ive definitely proven myself to be a stand up fighter out of my six opponents ive gotten four knockouts and one tko one submission i realize that i have the power to finish the fights in the first round and finish the fights on my feet
32298 without taking any credit from this guy ive got nothing but the utmost amount of confidence in myself and i think that i can stand with this guy and maybe knock him out
32299 the ali shuffle is something that ive been working on
32300 its really confusing my opponents and i could see it happening
32301 this will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home
32302 itll also be the last chance for others who may have never seen the flyers play at the spectrum it will be a highly emotional game for me personally
32303 the injury happened about two and a half weeks before the fight
32304 i punched training partner wanderlei silva in the top of the head and i broke my hand
32305 i wasnt using my left hand as much as i could have
32306 my left hand i didnt realize how much i used it until the second day after i broke it
32307 it was another sparring day and i just taped it up real good and put a glove on it and i just used it to block i just used it for defense that day i really figured out that my left is a huge part of my arsenal in my stand up i use it for the jab i also use it coming over the top catching guys as they come in
32308 i wanted that fight so bad that they could have chopped my arm off and i still would have taken that fight
32309 ive been working for two years since i fought keith jardine to get back to fight at this caliber to fight a guy like that
32310 i never told anybody or said anything after the fight because its a fight i knew it was going to be a fight
32311 i went in there knowing i had a broken hand that was my choice and its not taking anything away from babalu at all he fought well he fought tough
32312 one of the best things ever is that after the fight randy couture came up to me and said lets not focus on the win or loss lets focus on your performance
32313 which i agree i did a lot of stand up im comfortable in my stand up now
32314 it was good to fight a guy at that level and i cant wait to get back to that level
32315 id love to get back in there this next show get that win back and get back on the right track
32316 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
32317 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
32318 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
32319 but on the other hand this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
32320 i actually walked around the facility the other day looking for a place i could park it that had shade but there is not one stitch of shade on this whole facility thats all right though i go in at night turn on the ac crank the generator up about 9 oclock come in for a few minutes make a couple phone calls then go back
32321 we finally decided to buy one last year and with the option of either driving all the way to franklin or staying at the hotel neither were the best of options so i chose to bring an rv up here and sleep in it during training camp
32322 it worked out great we get out of meetings at 9 30 10 oclock sometimes its just too late to have to drive all the way back home so i just crash in the rv
32323 im not a sleep in between practice guy anyway i hang out here check my e mails pay bills watch tv read books whatever
32324 i had teammates when i was in training camp share a camper so its been done before i dont see it becoming an epidemic
32325 its not quite an old airstream but its also not a pop up
32326 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use

32392 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
32393 i am leaving nova scotia due to inadequate resources and services for children with autism spectrum disorder in this province
32394 i sincerely regret the inconvenience this will pose to the 1 117 patients on my waiting list
32395 i know a lot of people who have done reconstruction from him its a real shame that were going to lose his capabilities here
32396 the son is responding well to treatment but the program in nova scotia only allows 12 hours a week and the child needs much more than that
32397 if he goes to winnipeg which is where hes going hell get 30 hours a week
32398 hes just at the age where it could make a big difference and i think hes concerned about that and rightfully so
32399 she is a native nova scotian and he was clearly trying to build a career and a life here
32400 we dont want to lose any surgeon for any reason
32401 do we have enough services yet no but ultimately i think that the acute care system takes an awful lot of money to run and it doesnt leave us a lot of money left over for autism so i think were doing pretty well we need to do a lot more
32402 ultimately we do want to add more dollars as years go by
32403 children get assessed some make it into the program and some dont
32404 i cant fault him for that kind of decision to move away to get more help if thats what he feels
32405 ultimately i think the program weve got is a good program maybe its not enough time in his mind but compared to where we were weve gone a long way
32406 and i warn you some of the coverage is disturbing
32407 so we heard a scream aye and then we all exited the bus aye and then the man tried to stab us too aye later we saw him holding the guys head aye

32431 i would be surprised if someone made a change without at least informing him rogge
32432 but i really do not know the detail i only know the ground rules on censorship have changed but have only been announced here it must have related to a former understanding to which i was not a party
32433 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
32434 we met today with the organizers because having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have had media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
32435 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
32436 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
32437 the concept is ready but we are still working on the product we hope to finalise it before this year end in india the company is well positioned in the niche segment we are now gearing up to enter the mainstream of motorisation
32438 overall these findings show that their brains are not working properly to start with and the metabolic impairment gets worse over time
32439 however we dont know why or how this happens our study shows for the first time that individuals with an alzheimers disease affected mother may be at increased risk for developing alzheimers disease themselves because their brains are not utilizing glucose in an effective way
32440 at this point we can only speculate that genes that are maternally inherited may alter brain metabolism
32441 we need to follow subjects for longer time periods to ascertain whether the metabolic reductions are in fact forerunning cognitive deterioration
32442 this includes checking for blood pressure cholesterol levels glucose levels arteriosclerosis and vascular damage in general because improving cardiovascular health is particularly important to also promote brain health
32443 if an individual finds out that they are at risk for developing alzheimers disease and are not taking much care of their health thats already a good reason to start immediately
32444 one could collect the children of mothers with alzheimers disease divide them into a placebo group and a drug test group and follow them with neuropsych tests and brain scans to see whether the group receiving the drug had delayed onset or prevention
32445 our best hope is to catch the disease early and treat early
32446 one way of doing this is to identify people with significant genetic risk but we only know one common risk factor apoe4 gene
32447 this is significant because it broadens the utility of imaging as a tool for detecting the disease early not simply in those with a specific form of genetic risk

32450 you may not be able to do away with the jee but i am wondering if we should be conducting an examination for 3 00 00 aspirants and selecting just 5 000 instead we must evolve a system where only the top 1 of students from different state boards and cbse are permitted to appear for the jee
32451 one of the reasons for the poor intake of girls in the flagship btech programme is that parents dont send daughters for coaching classes the best way to increase the intake of girls is to have direct admissions
32452 the overall capability of a student cannot be merely assessed by their performance in physics mathematics and chemistry the student must have good communication skills also
32453 they students think there is nothing wrong in missing school to attend coaching but the student does not realize his real loss
32454 but the cbse and other boards turned it down and wanted to have 60 as the cut off now thats an easy score to get
32455 if we can develop another system that is not overhyped i am for it but doing away with the jee does not seem appropriate at present we have been constantly working on tweaking the jee as per the students needs and also to cut down on pressure

32522 since he owes more than what the property is currently worth he can try to short sale the bank will basically take a 11k loss from the mortgage along with any other costs associated with the sale but he must provide proof of hardship for the lender to consider a short sale the lender will require him to write a sob story and explain why he can no longer pay his mortgage with bank statements paystubs and w2s to support the story from my understanding the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 allows the seller to sell at a loss without being taxed for the forgiven amount if the property is owner occupied and the mortgage is purchase money non refinanced i will advise mr woo to consult a tax adviser to get clarification yah foreclosure is definitely going to be a bigger hit to your credit rating so a short sale should be your first approach write a letter to the lender that you are approaching a state where you will no longer be able to stay current on your payments and that you would like to avoid that scenario so you need them to work with you an a short sale

32663 masih banyak perempuan yang takut dianggap tidak suci karena sudah tidak perawan padahal robeknya selaput dara tidak selalu karena hubungan seks bisa saja karena perkosaan atau trauma akibat jatuh atau kecelakaan
32664 selaput dara itu bukan seperti beduk yang akan pecah bila ditusuk bentuknya bisa halus seperti renda atau seperti cincin dan baru benar benar robek bila seseorang sudah melahirkan bayi secara normal
32665 menurut saya itu adalah penipuan buat apa hymen dibuat utuh padahal sebenarnya ia sudah melakukan hubungan

32724 stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime its a crime in every system i know of taking property thats not yours thats a crime but when were dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know whats somebodys and whats not somebody elses
32725 particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and thats nothing new weve done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal its encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
32726 there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
32727 these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesnt allow it to occur the code doesnt function that way
32728 who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
32729 its a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle its a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
32730 congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments its totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
32731 similarly they can say were going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
32732 there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
32733 in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
32734 as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but were able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
32735 virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
32736 avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault
32737 where one of the two versions is broader than the other the common meaning would favour the more restricted or limited meaning
32738 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forawrd i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times

32740 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
32741 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
32742 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
32743 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
32744 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
32745 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
32746 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
32747 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
32748 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
32749 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
32750 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
32751 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
32752 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
32753 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
32754 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
32755 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
32756 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
32757 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
32758 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
32759 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
32760 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
32761 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
32762 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
32763 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
32764 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
32765 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
32766 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
32767 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
32768 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
32769 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union

32826 now get your shoes off and sit the fuck down
32827 given the recent trend of success that we in red sox nation have been blessed with i hope we do not all forget the journey we have taken to get here and specifically the role of manny ramirez in that journey
32828 he came to us at the last second when we had missed out on mussina and needed to make a splash
32829 true he has not always played the game the right way and it can be argued that his attitude was sometimes less than helpful to the team chemistry but through all the drama he never lost that swing
32830 when he watched his home run off k rod in the 2007 post season arms raised in triumph we saw that same manny that we fell in love with now that his time has come to move on for whatever reason i hope that we do not lose sight of everything he has done for us and when we speak of him and his time in boston i hope we all realize what we owe to him for the home runs the laughs the championships the intangible sense of excitement that happened every time he came to bat in the late innings at fenway we owe him more than to think back fondly on his time here we owe him our hearts

32835 today well increase it to 1 500 tomorrow if we have to increase it to 1 600 or 1 700 we will then if we need to more we can use the crane and two extra pullers that arent being used now
32836 that will allow us to cut that material off and make it lighter
32837 then we will pull again cut it of and make it lighter then we will finally take the last big part and then there wont be anymore of it
32838 by bringing them together there will be some synergy to take place to expand the amount of research thats conducted here

32840 they are going to have their own little tide pools
32841 there they will learn what those critters are and then come back here go out to the beach look at them in their natural environment its that kind of working together that makes a community a better place
32842 weve got this rich environment of research scientists who could be available for industries who could want to work in this area to enhance our natural resources
32843 so many people cant afford to buy books all the time in book stores so they can supplement that by coming and finding bargains here at the book sales and now theyll be able to come to the book store as well
32844 its hugely important to the library because the friends group uses the money to provide programming for kids and adults
32845 if you fly in only one vendor make it the photographer since so many of the dealings with your shutterbug will take place after the wedding ordering prints assembling albums etc its actually more convenient to have that professional based near you and if you use a local photographer in another country and something goes wrong worst case scenario he or she loses the film sic youll have little or no legal recourse also as a stylistic consideration american wedding photographers tend to have a much more journalistic style than many of their foreign counterparts who often take more traditional posed photos so if youre marrying abroad and would like your photos to have a natural candid look you may want to fly in a photographer

32850 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
32851 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
32852 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
32853 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
32854 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

32912 i now believe that the majority of business training by me and by everyone else is a waste of money and time because only a microscopic fraction of training is ever put into practice and the hoped for benefits obtained
32913 the truth is that most firms go about training entirely the wrong way they decide what they wished their people were good at allocate a budget to a training director and ask that training director to come up with a good program
32914 like any management professionals we should ask ourselves if the results of our training are both value for money and properly aligned to the goals of the organization
32915 the summary is this if the training has been in regular operating groups in carefully chosen topics right when the group can use the training and with the groups leader in the room they can immediately begin a discussion of how they plan to integrate the trainings ideas into their practices with the right preparation and follow up training can be immensely powerful
32916 in other words it is just not sufficient for leaders who manage the learning process in organizations to focus on measuring learning outcomes that remain course centered meaningful learning outcomes are business centered and require that level of measurement to remain relevant to the organizations objectives
32917 what are the critical areas of investment in people answering this question requires opening direct communication channels with top company executives to understand the business strategy and road map and then to align and create appropriate formal and informal employee learning experiences that support the road map

32930 well we actually just got off the phone and he authorized for me to withdraw some money
32931 no maam you dont understand youre husband did not authorize you in the system to withdraw any money
32932 i see so my name is on the account but i am not authorized to withdraw any money
32933 you just have to kick and scream and they will give you some money

32947 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
32948 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
32949 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
32950 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
32951 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
32952 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

32975 in berlijn rekenden we een diner met vier mensen zonder wijn voor 45 euro af daarvoor kan ik in amsterdam net in mijn eentje uit eten gaan
32976 in feite kunnen de gays gezien worden als de kanariepieten van de creatieve stad
32977 daarbij mag er ook meer aandacht komen voor cultuur want homos willen niet alleen naar partys

33034 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

33069 memang merupakan kubu kuat anwar dan isterinya datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail memenangi kerusi itu pada 2004 walaupun ketika itu populariti bn berada di kemuncaknya
33070 kerusi kerusi lain yang disebut hanya satu taktik untuk mengelirukan pilihan raya kecil ini agak sukar bagi bn
33071 kami perlu berjuang dalam pilihan raya kecil ini dengan jujur secara terhormat dan dengan penuh rendah hati bn pulau pinang perlu melakukan yang terbaik
33072 hanya dengan cara itu kami akan mendapat penghormatan dan sokongan orang ramai
33073 insya allah umno boleh menang rakyat sekarang dah tengok sendiri macam mana pakatan rakyat mentadbir negeri ini dan mereka hanya pandai bercakap tetapi tidak membuat kerja
33074 akhirnya anwar memilih tempat yang sesuai untuk beliau dan sebelum inipun anwar pernah bertanding di situ
33075 bagi saya di mana sahaja anwar bertanding kami akan memberikan sokongan yang padu
33076 kalau wan azizah boleh menang pada pilihan raya lepas dengan majoriti lebih 13 000 undi mengapa pula anwar tidak boleh sedangkan itu memang kawasan beliau
33077 kita hanya nak lihat anggota umno mana yang sanggup bertanding dengan anwar itu yang kita dok tunggu

33079 tendulkar rahul sourav all fell to good balls so you cannot do anything about it sri lanka have quality bowlers
33080 i think 350 to 400 runs should be a good total on this wicket
33081 i dont know because i was on the non strikers end and could not pick it up i was in doubt whether the ball had hit or not but i felt it had hit the helmet i feel if they sri lankans had known about it then it was not the right spirit of sri lankans if the sri lankan had known it then i think they should have played with the right spirit and said that the ball had hit off helmet
33082 we were in a good position the first wicket partnership was around 167 runs and then we lost four wickets these things happen in a test match it happens so many times but you cannot do anything
33083 i thought it was a googly and then it could have been on the off stump also because sometimes it becomes difficult for the umpires to pick but then it struck on the middle stump we just took a chance to avail of the review system
33084 there was no impact on my batting after delay of four hours but every batsmen plays with a different mindset maybe some other batsmen could have been affected by it but i was just playing my shots
33085 vaas was giving me a tough time as his incoming deliveries were good so i was very careful in the first one and a half hour of the innings

33111 the group is fine as it is were only waiting to see how the situation with etoo will develop
33112 barca have not received any offer from any italian club although we have spoken with inter and milan
33113 hes a player with similar characteristics however if neither of these two leave it would be practically impossible for etoo to come
33114 our goal is to keep silva and villa in our squad as they are in fact two very important reinforcements
33115 the freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men
33116 pushing the federal government before we have a critical mass of states recognizing same sex relationships or suing in states where the courts arent ready is likely to get us bad rulings bad rulings will make it much more difficult for us to win marriage and will certainly make it take much longer
33117 do you support legal recognition of marriages between partners of the same sex
33118 in the district of columbia for all legal purposes marriage means the union of one man and one woman
33119 acting d c attorney general peter nickles told the blade that he has advised fenty not to release the memo
33120 i believe that domestic partner programs should afford same sex couples the rights and privileges of all other couples
33121 i support civil unions with all the rights and responsibilities of marriage
33122 lane hudson and i met at a community forum earlier this year
33123 we both asked questions around marriage and thats how we connected for the last few months weve been talking to community leaders asking if there is interest in a marriage campaign here in the district getting advice on who else we should talk to
33124 glaa seeks the fundamental right to marry as part of the full integration into american society that is our birthright a policy of exclusion against same sex couples amounts to red lining the american dream and saying that liberty and justice for all does not apply to you if youre a member of an unpopular minority
33125 maybe we should also wait until there are gays on mars until all bigotry and hatred is banished everywhere and we all live on gumdrop mountain at the mouth of stoli river
33126 could this like the ban on district spending for needle exchange programs be one more issue the district could theoretically make up its own mind about now that democrats control congress
33127 its an unhappy standoff the gay establishment doesnt want to make their friends in the democratic party uncomfortable and the democratic establishment doesnt feel it needs to carry water for its gay constituents because after all where else are we going to go

33134 sense of the council on opposing a federal marriage amendment resolution of 2004
33135 were excited about this year because we feel like we have a real team a real nfl team for the first time it was difficult to stand up here in 05 and really to a degree in 06 and know youre going to struggle
33136 we used every tool to try to build the team its a lot easier to pick out the best 10 or 12 players we have on the team than it was a few years ago and its difficult to pick out players on the bottom that dont belong in the league i feel good about our depth
33137 the unseen secret to success in the nfl is to have the same owner the same coach same front office people and same staff
33138 we feel like our window began to open last year and were excited about what the future holds for 08 09 10 11
33139 we think the division is going to be tough i think weve certainly closed the gap and hopefully in some cases weve surpassed that that gap and gotten ahead of some of the teams in our division
33140 the reality of it is its who youre playing outside the division this year we have the afc south and nfc east all of our division opponents we all play the same teams with the exception of two games
33141 we play buffalo and denver pittsburgh plays san diego and new england the ravens play oakland and miami thats it thats the only difference
33142 my point is whether we get off to a fast start or a slow start i think its a division race that will last all the way to the last couple of games i really dont care what anybody else is doing im worried about what were doing
33143 i think its pretty easy to say the two defensive linemen shaun rogers and corey williams if shaun rogers can continue what hes done the first five or six days of training camp hes going to prove hes a force to be reckoned with
33144 were real excited about what weve seen on the tape so far to be honest if he rogers performs up to the level hes capable of which he has shown out here he can do he single handily could take our rankings 30th overall defense up quite a long way
33145 because everything starts up front and everything feeds off what happens in front of your team whether its on offense or defense
33146 if we improve on defense and keep our offense improving off of what they did last year then were going to be pretty good people are worried about our schedule but they have to play us too i think thats a real difference from in years past
33147 i would say the organization and the team everyone is excited because the browns have kind of been off the nfl radar screen for a while
33148 certainly this year were going to be on television a lot you know my grandmother doesnt have to order direct tv to get the browns anymore shes actually going to get to see them on real tv
33149 do these earrings look to much like the heather guidero pair i own

33151 all persons are by nature free and independent and have certain natural and unalienable rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness
33152 the practice of referring to these bonds as revenue bonds is highly misleading because often and specifically in the case of the pending 3 9 billion bond offering for school construction bonds there is no revenue source other than appropriations by future legislatures which cannot be bound contractually
33153 in fact as the courts have made clear contract bonds are bonds that are not backed by the full faith and credit clause of the state just like with fannie mae and freddie mac moodys is assuming paper is good paper without actually looking at what will happen if there is an inability to pay

33189 snoop wants to do a hindi movie with akshay as he is really keen on wooing the indian audiences the most interesting aspect of the song is that one gets to see two very different styles hip hop with snoop and bhangra with akshay their chemistry was worth seeing as theyre superstars from two different worlds to say the least the video is looking brilliant
33190 i wouldnt say we shot in egypt just for the glam factor the story is such that it takes akshays character from punjab to egypt and then to australia so we have about 7 8 scenes in egypt as well we did a complete 15 day schedule there and you wont believe some of the shots weve canned theyll take your breath away
33191 wed already shown punjab which lent a very rustic earthy kitsch character to singh is kinng then we had australia which is very modern neat and glossy so we decided to add a third terrain to the film for the exotica and egypt came about with these three locales the audience will find the film constantly evolving on screen there are parts of egypt in the film that no ones seen before on celluloid
33192 with these changes we feel that with an employee base in the 30s we are sized appropriately as a small focused organization
33193 northstar not only refused to negotiate in good faith regarding the third party offer but it also concealed the third party offer from its stockholders and the public
33194 i am a gujarati but i think i was a punjabi in my last birth on a serious note ive always been fascinated with north india as a child my father took us to north india for vacations so ive seen it extensively and find that culture very captivating punjabis are gregarious hospital and big hearted people everything about them is grand their fashion food music and i think that makes for great viewing also both akshay and i felt that as people tend to make fun of sardars in their jokes lets break that impression and present the real heroism and spirit of punjab if you track their history youll realise that the punjabis are a very dilayre community singh is kinng celebrates the spirit and passion of punjabis in an extremely entertaining manner and within the confines of a big commercial bollywood extravaganza it is a film that you can sit back and enjoy
33195 my forthcoming film after singh is kinng will also have a punjabi flavour in it

33201 this is a logical extension and important part of our strategy to further increase recurring earnings in our sugar business and improve our renewable energy capability
33202 csr has long experience in producing renewable fuel ethanol from molasses a by product of raw sugar production and this project further enhances our ability to meet the exponential growth in the fuel ethanol market
33203 demand for fuel ethanol continues to grow strongly particularly as awareness of its greenhouse gas abatement qualities increases
33204 the nature of csrs ethanol process means that every litre of csr ethanol produces less than half the co2 emissions of petrol with no impact on food prices

33282 for weeks i would try occassionally gently to scrape off a bit of the saintly patina gilding the life of padre gaetano i had this notion that i would recognize him more fully and relate to him more clearly if i could somehow glimpse the man who walked the earth like the rest of us foibles and all yet who alive would know the real gaetano who would be old enough now forty three years after the saints death to have known him as a peer not as a child who would have seen him through clear eyes in the context of his time and in concert with other priets toiling in the same troubled fields

33311 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
33312 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
33313 if you start to have governments preaching to the reserve bank about particular levels of monetary policy at particular times it is not a good recipe for the long term future because then you have the monetary authorities subject to day to day political pressure
33314 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
33315 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment
33316 but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
33317 the next doom game will look like its built on another engine as it uses three times the horsepower
33318 weve seen a run of softer data and we also started seeing the reserve bank make noises about the fact they were happy with the current policy settings
33319 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day

33325 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado

33328 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi

33335 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much

33341 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
33342 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
33343 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
33344 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
33345 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
33346 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
33347 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
33348 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
33349 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
33350 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
33351 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

33373 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
33374 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar

33376 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
33377 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
33378 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
33379 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
33380 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful
33381 to benefit institutionalized children in desperate need of a voice
33382 i understand that ms spears is reluctantly agreeing to extend those letters
33383 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard
33384 i didnt realize i was working so hard to actually capture his attention that really showed me thats the day i realized i made it
33385 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
33386 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
33387 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash
33388 i realize i been foolish i never should have turned my back
33389 cause its a cold world when youre out there all alone so many times i wanted to pick up the phone and tell you ooh baby baby i miss your loving so
33390 do you think we can pick up where we left off before the day that i told you it was over packed my things and moved away
33391 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album
33392 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
33393 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
33394 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
33395 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
33396 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
33397 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
33398 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
33399 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
33400 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge
33401 we had to keep the hockey mask which is where it all started and camp crystal lake as a jumping off point for us to go back to the first one
33402 we wanted to make a movie that was fun and we havent done that before
33403 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie
33404 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
33405 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
33406 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
33407 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
33408 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
33409 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
33410 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
33411 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
33412 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
33413 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
33414 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
33415 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity
33416 i really wanted to say hey i helped beat jet li up
33417 they would have to sew me in in that first fight every time i flipped my pantyhose were always down around my ankles
33418 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at any time in the future
33419 mr lutfi and mr spears britneys father and conservator jamie spears have mutually agreed in private that no hearing or order is necessary at this time
33420 if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action
33421 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
33422 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
33423 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
33424 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
33425 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
33426 thats definitely been the rumor and its been coming from their camp so i really cant conform that at all i positively cannot confirm that i hear that its his birthday that weekend so he might be in town but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumors and that would be really cool right but there are definitely no guarantees youll just have to settle on listening to great music
33427 tom morello man i tell you what tom morello is the real deal and you will not be disappointed
33428 well you start walking the grounds and they start loading everything in and you see sort of how your blueprints working out
33429 youve got everything from the stages to the sound and lights to your backstages your artist area your vip area your cabana area and then you get floods of friends and guests that want to come and where are you going to accommodate them and you get new areas youre putting in you always have sound issues because you have so many stages so you have to position each stage and the speakers so they dont affect that other area
33430 weve got a ton of trees in grant park and were really maximizing those trees this year
33431 aside from the music the other thing were creating here is a scene
33432 its the most important aspect of lollapalooza aside from the music and the musicians themselves it goes right to the audience and whos there people want to bop around and meet people and maybe hook up so were always looking to create social situations and social stimulations within the grounds
33433 as far as our single day ticket counts radiohead seem to have taken this year
33434 radiohead sold out first and their production is just incredible
33435 we also have nine inch nails and trent reznors production is one of the best in the world
33436 i can tell you that on the inside hes ramping up if you thought nine inch was great before and the production was great before theyre stepping it up that much more now and when jack white came in with the raconteurs the first time lots of people said it was the best act weve had i am assuming these guys have developed and evolved together so thats going to be a great rock show
33437 this year i couldnt ask for a better lineup but its going to be quite something to top 2008 we are the biggest festival in the country overflowing with 75 000 people a day so i think this year were done weve done it but next year were already speaking and planning and guess what next year looks fantastic it really is unbelievable
33438 get out and vote or the end will be near
33439 the world is ready for change because obama is here
33440 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
33441 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
33442 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man
33443 provided a statement to law enforcement that was useful in the sheriffs office investigation of our case
33444 i basically stepped outside of my comfort zone and i came up with something that i can honestly say is for everyone
33445 i think that one of the emphases will be that a gentleman is diverse
33446 i worked with all the normal people that i work with like stargate but is one of the newer cats that ive worked with
33447 i went and got a fake id with a different name and i have a pair of sunglasses and a hat
33448 the game is incredibly accurate its identical and its so intuitive for me as a player that i have become better at my instrument its gotten me a hotter girlfriend its made me better looking and ive made more money since playing it
33449 that or you pick out of a hat which is not fun we can run faster than dashboard confessional so if it comes down to a foot race it should be us

33493 their story is one of great regret because they actually compromised the whole of portuguese timor and brought the whole of the devastation of war and all the issues of compromising neutrality and requiring support and sustenance from the land
33494 the story that unfolded as i went i began to get a greater depth and understanding of just what this group of men had undertaken
33495 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains that we have made
33496 significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge

33499 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
33500 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
33501 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
33502 well see what happens with the center thing once we get into the preseason games but id have to say were pretty well set
33503 hes very locked in to pitching and hes what we thought he was
33504 sometimes that offspeed stuff the slider cutter comes later id rather see the feel of the changeup and the fastball command than i would with the slider and all that to me thats the last thing to come
33505 he looks like hes pretty polished for a young pitcher
33506 when youre a young pitcher you say who does he remind me of i can tell you he looks like hes a got a pretty good feel of what hes doing hes pretty sound and his stuff really looks very good
33507 we felt the opportunity to acquire a young pitcher made sense as we look toward 2009 and beyond

33509 we had some really good talks with seattle they were pretty intense and pretty in depth
33510 we thought at one point there was a possibility to get something done there but it just didnt come to fruition
33511 i think at the end of the day they just didnt feel as comfortable going forward to finish off the trade it was just something that didnt come to fruition both parties worked hard at the end of the day they probably werent as comfortable with making the trade as we were that happens
33512 i think at the end of the day they just didnt feel as comfortable going forward to finish off the trade
33513 you can still make moves after aug 1 with certain restrictions but we also have the offseason
33514 there is a lot of time to make moves we are not in any time crunch there is no deadline to get this club turned around in the next two days the next week or the next two or three weeks we have time to do this and we plan to do it systematically step by step
33515 there were about nine good reviews for every bad one
33516 we are now in the position where the odds of us winning are very good
33517 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
33518 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

33529 he just wants to be a part of everything its everything we thought when we picked him i cant think of one negative with him
33530 its fun again it kind of lost all the fun in atlanta its just fun again to play football
33531 just just plays im trying to make as many plays as possible you might see me back there returning kicks you might see me on offense its kinda its all up in the air
33532 sam williams is in a heated battle with robert thomas for the slb spot apparently grant irons was also being considered strongly until he got hurt
33533 becoming an oakland raider means more to me than just getting back on the field its a chance to play for the best franchise in football history it has the best fans that any sport has to offer a great cast of talented players amp coaches a legend as an owner one of the best attack style defensive coordinators in the league in rex ryan and most of all i get to be reunited with the best coach i have ever played for coach don martindale i vow to do everything in my power to bring another superbowl to al davis and the raider nation
33534 instinctively this guy has not lost a step he has brought his toughness to the team which has spread throughout our lb meeting room this guy is everyday tough a true veteran who wants everyone around him to get better
33535 in the national football league or in college football something that has always separated ed from other linebackers i have coached you dont have to watch him play because you can hear him play
33536 so much of our success this year depends on the development of darren and jarmarus
33537 that almost concluded his entire speach on the subject and to be quite honest he didnt sound too enthused about the idea not that id somewhat blame him
33538 i ts an ongoing process that might take as long as a month
33539 dick vitale is awesome i love listening to him and he is one of the best in the game
33540 the longer you coach the more you realize you dont have to have the best talent
33541 you can beat teams that might be a little more talented than you are if youre willing to work harder plus its more fun youre not dealing with a bunch of guys who are upset that theyre still in college when theyre juniors
33542 going to choke it to death until somebody pulls my grip off of it
33543 if favre comes in as much as the accolades are huge on that side im the starting quarterback and its going to be a battle
33544 jeff garcia is our starting quarterback were in the fourth day of training camp and we want to play a lot better football than we did last season
33545 he loves quarterbacks but he likes to just date he doesnt like to marry
33546 i have heard that my jersey is selling really well i always joke that 90 percent of the fans buying the jersey are coming from hawaii i have a lot of loyalty to hawaii and i have a great following there id love to start the same thing here in washington
33547 weve got to look after him a little bit here in the second half
33548 we had our setup guys and closer fresh we just have to hold it for him
33549 im going to play hard to get a big contract then once its signed do nothing but smoke dope
33550 what timon marshall oh man that must have been a typo we wanted simon marshall
33551 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
33552 i told milt and roger goodell that if talking to teams is tampering then theres about seven to 10 teams that are guilty of tampering
33553 regrettably the irl has chosen to structure their sanction fees at such a level that we had no choice but to re evaluate whether they fit into our plan regardless we believe the irl had no further interest in the middle tennessee market we are very grateful to firestone and their support of the firestone indy 200 for the past seven years

33563 i repeat no for me no 2 was very important and i was very happy be the no 2 because with my titles with my points in a normal situation i well would have been no 1 before
33564 every tournament is very difficult no i won here in canada in 2005 so win title here is very very important for me no especially because this year i didnt won a tournament yet on hard right now i have five titles in a row in three different surfaces so thats very very good for me no
33565 is the clock ticking for chad jackson and a few others
33566 on orlandos side he said they feel that if turkoglu has a season like he had last year that they will not be able to afford him apparently the magic have little intention of resigning turk anyways and were already planning on trading him at the deadline but had concerns about the effects that could have on team chemistry at mid season
33567 the role evans can play for this team has nothing to do with offense and so much more to do with what he can do defensively
33568 the hawks have needed a defensive stopper if you will to help alleviate that pressure on joe johnson evans could be the off the bench stopper the hawks havent had the past few years a guy that comes in alongside johnson on the defensive end and a guy who can also stroke the ball from deep to keep teams off balance on the other end of the floor
33569 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
33570 we might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown
33571 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
33572 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle its a problem we need to resolve this conflict is totally unacceptable

33586 hes a competitor hes obviously an athlete he is feisty and he is tough he butted up a few guys
33587 this whole thing just seems like a huge production it seems like a circus on wheels
33588 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
33589 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
33590 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
33591 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
33592 having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
33593 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
33594 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
33595 every athlete the clean ones and the not clean ones should clearly know that we mean business
33596 the ioc will do everything that is humanly possible to have the cleanest possible games
33597 my hamstring is back and it feels good running around with the guys

33599 raiders sound bites nfl conversations and the dark knight makes an appearance in the dark side
33600 the canadian public demands that their military personnel be held to a higher standard
33601 i have no doubt that our troops have been doing a lot of good there so why dont we ever hear about it
33602 the new leadership in the canadian forces has insisted on enforcing the standards of conduct physical fitness and universality of service this started about eight or nine years ago
33603 dont be worried about me for the first week kind of ease into it and take it from there we just want to be smart about practice we still have to get work in still have a long way to go obviously the more you practice the better youll be you also have to be smart about how you do it we still have a lot of football left to be played but no concerns on this end
33604 im comfortable ive been studying the playbook when my numbers called ive got to go in there and perform i feel good about it i communicate with him
33605 i hadnt heard of it i didnt even know the name of it
33606 it was an awful awful thing the kids i had 18 and 19 year olds tearing up curled up on the floor for an entire day
33607 we have a bug in the pools thats resistant to the major barrier that kills most of the germs that gets transmitted
33608 they are not the perfect answer to this though we still have to get the public to understand their role in preventing the initial contamination of the water
33609 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
33610 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
33611 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
33612 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
33613 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
33614 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
33615 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
33616 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
33617 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
33618 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
33619 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
33620 it is tempting im taking ginseng fish oil ginkgo and all the over the counter things that the doctors say dont have any proof that it helps but it doesnt hurt
33621 i think there was an article about that in our paper this morning
33622 i actually even called my husband about it as far as trying a drug what is there to lose really at this point
33623 you try to want to balance between being optimistic and aggressive and not going into things that are just quackery
33624 i would certainly discuss it with the neurologists and if they thought it would be safe and wouldnt be a problem id try anything
33625 from a surgeons standpoint the main thing we use methylene blue for is we inject it into the patients veins and it turns their urine blue thats so we can find leaks
33626 in the end i decided the only way to win was to win to have a clinical trial that proves the point
33627 as a result ive already had several calls from my office saying is this available can i get this for my mom and dad
33628 its a fine line trying to give people the idea that theres hope out there in the field because there really is but also tempering the news based on the information
33629 weve read so many reports of things that were so promising and then we go and talk to the neurologist
33630 in the final analysis so far always they dont hold up to the original hype that comes out
33631 but there are so many of these studies that somebody has got to hit on one of these
33632 andrade indicated he became angered by his discovery and struck victim zapata with his fists
33633 the crime that we are looking at here just cant be tolerated anywhere
33634 i hope that if anything positive were to come of this we would build a stronger relationship with the gay lesbian and transgender community so they understand just how seriously we take these cases
33635 there is a possibility that the suspect did have bias against transgender women
33636 regardless of whether those formal charges are filed its important to notice that these type of crimes affect the gay lesbian and transgender community
33637 we want the whole community involved to find this person who hurt my sister and to let everyone be aware that all she wanted was to be beautiful
33638 we want this violence to end transgender people deserve to be treated with respect
33639 thats a very common and very tragic slur used by people who express anti transgender bias
33640 but not knowing what someones genitalia is not a reason for violence of any shape or form
33641 angie was murdered because a criminal was taught to disrespect anyone who would have the nerve to claim they beat someone with a fire hydrant because they found out they had male genitalia what kind of society do we live in when where that is being used as an excuse
33642 the trade shows that the former is still more important than the latter at redskins park
33643 im thinking that shes probably been there for a number of years
33644 part of the mystery here is that apparently none of these children were in school
33645 home schooling under this situation removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe
33646 she was kind of secluded shed talk but not much
33647 it was the ideal family i mean the children were so respectful just so easygoing
33648 didnt seem to be no stress at all never got that impression never

33657 whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her
33658 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
33659 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
33660 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
33661 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
33662 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
33663 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
33664 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
33665 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
33666 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
33667 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
33668 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
33669 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
33670 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
33671 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
33672 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
33673 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
33674 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
33675 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
33676 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
33677 im just having fun and trying to win games and thats it i just try not to think about whats going on and just take it one at bat at a time and try and do something every day to help us win thats it keep it simple
33678 well sometimes youve got to get lucky and turn on a few and then the key for me is using the whole field
33679 if theyre throwing it away just keep hitting it to left if they start coming in turn on it and make it tough on where theyre going to pitch you
33680 it was a little different this year going in a little more relaxed and just have fun with it
33681 i didnt want to use that as an excuse its just one of those things and hopefully the swing can keep feeling good
33682 hitting fourth the past couple of years and fifth before that and being in that spot the more i get up there the more comfortable i feel
33683 you try to do less when youre younger you start trying to do more and put pressure on yourself to come through in those situations now you just relax and have confidence in the guy behind you if they dont give you anything to hit take the walk and make it easy on yourself dont try and do too much you learn as you get older that simpler is sometimes better and you just have to find that
33684 its something that every kid playing peewee football in eden prairie like i did dreams about someday playing for the vikings so its great to be out here and be part of the team
33685 thats certainly a career path to envy and hopefully i get a chance to have that same kind of success here i think this is a great team and a great organization hopefully i can grow and become a better player here
33686 the evolution from the college game to the pro game of being aware of whats going on around you ratchets up even again
33687 its a huge jump from high school to college and again from college to the pros of having to know whats going on on the entire field and not just the 5 yards around you thats definitely taking a little bit of getting used to
33688 i knew that i probably wasnt going to get drafted but that i would have a shot as a priority free agent
33689 so i wasnt disappointed i just wanted to get everything figured out about where i was going to be afterwards and im glad it ended up being here

33700 i didnt believe him at first then he started crying
33701 thats birdy he is just a big sook he cries a lot
33702 if you dont know him there is that perception that he is an arrogant little turd he thinks he is so cool with his get up but it is terrible
33703 he wears chicks sunglasses and wheres wally t shirts and he has got these 1980s reebok pumps which he wears with the tongue out so everyone knows they are really reebok pumps
33704 he is a bit different for sure but to be honest you couldnt meet a better guy anyone who gets to know him could only call him one thing and that is a top bloke he is always there for a quiet beer and he always listens
33705 we got him with a screamer last year and yeah we made him cry he will deny it but he gave us a lift to the pub and he came in and left his keys on the table we went out and moved his car then put the keys back he said goodbye and left he came back about five minutes later crying saying his car had been stolen he even called his mum

33869 in the process he got extensive injuries not just him but a couple of our officers also he was evacuated straight to the hospital
33870 whatever crimes or wrong that josefa baleiloa may have done it still did not warrant the excessive use of brute force by members of the police especially when witnesses confirmed he was unarmed except for a mobile phone
33871 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
33872 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start

33879 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along

33882 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase

33884 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
33885 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy

33887 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
33888 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
33889 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
33890 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
33891 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
33892 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
33893 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
33894 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
33895 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running

33904 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
33905 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
33906 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
33907 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio

33911 nasehatilah dr hertzel agar tidak mengambil langkah langkah serius dalam masalah tersebut karena saya tidak dapat melepaskan palestina meski sejengkal ia bukan milikku akan tetapi milik ummat islam kaumku telah berjihad dan menumpahkan darah mereka untuk merebut tanah tersebut jika suatu saat daulah khilafah telah tercerai berai maka pada saat itu mereka dapat mengambil palestina tanpa kompensasi apapun namun selama nyawa masih di kandung badan saya maka dibedahnya tubuh ini lebih ringan bagi saya daripada melihat palestina lepas dari negara khilafah kami tidak akan pernah setuju jasad kami dibedah sementara kami masih hidup
33912 barangsiapa yang mentaati saya maka ia telah mentati allah dan barangsiapa yang mentaati pemimpin maka ia telah mentaati saya barangsiapa yang bermaksiat kepada pemimpin maka ia telah bermaksiat kepada saya sesungguhnya imam adalah perisai di mana kaum muslimin berperang dan berlindung di baliknya jika ia memerintahkan dengan ketakwaan kepada allah dan berbuat adil maka ia akan mendapat pahala dan jika ia berkata sebaliknya maka ia akan mendapatkan dosa

33978 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
33979 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
33980 regardless of whether singer songwriter adam nations folk rock outfit the great outdoors is performing as a five piece ensemble a moving trio or even simply as a one man band solo act complete with kick drum and bass pedals the outcome at the end of each live show is always the same a room full of people stirred to laughter moved to tears and outright musically hypnotized by one of the premier acts in the country
33981 from a strategic view women are our best hope for winning medals
33982 its been a tough few weeks with everything thats happened with graham
33983 to see graham walk back into the rooms this morning its just put a smile on everyones face
33984 we knew graham got out of hospital on wednesday but for graham to walk into the club was overwhelming for the players
33985 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future
33986 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
33987 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
33988 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
33989 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
33990 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
33991 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
33992 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
33993 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
33994 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running
33995 i am pleased that the judge has set a speedy trial date which should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
33996 we have a bill of rights and a trial by jury in our country to protect our citizens so that every person has their day in court

34013 what i will remember most about david was how well he lived how authentically he lived every moment
34014 i learned so much from david even in his struggle with als and his passing
34015 he was known internationally he was a fighter for als patients and kind of led the way in a lot of the possible treatments including the one he flew to cleveland for
34016 he had such a positive outlook all the time which is not always the case with attorneys
34017 david is a lesson for all of us who are caught up in our professional lives that the mark of a truly great human being is one who transcends his daily worldly life and david through his life and his art and his children has transcended lou gehrigs disease
34018 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
34019 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
34020 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
34021 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
34022 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
34023 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
34024 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
34025 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
34026 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
34027 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
34028 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
34029 we must also be prepared to act quickly to secure those weapons and materials in cases where a state loses control of its weapons especially nuclear devices

34041 the portrait photograph of the girl looking at the camera is obviously jess but although the photos appear to have similarities in style and setting im confident that the girl in the topless photograph is not her
34042 if you look on the web site im no 5
34043 i looked at the depth chart i peeked at it one time just to see
34044 i know that thats obvious im the guy in the preseason game who comes in when all the vets got their reps and i try to show out i try to get 100 yards
34045 if he asks me to go out with the 10th team im going to go out there whenever he calls my number i just want to go out there and do the right thing
34046 i was the air it out champion every year at receiver
34047 ive got a little something i wouldnt be surprised if sooner or later in my career im at the slot position
34048 running post routes if reggie bush can do it i can do it im just saying im not scared we have post routes at the running back position were just not that far in the playbook but i can do it i can do it
34049 i even threw a halfback pass for a touchdown in college
34050 think about how i got to the nfl think about how i got to the position im in now i was undrafted man ive been cut three times
34051 do you think theres something that is going to deter me one bit i wouldnt be where i am if i was like that i just keep moving forward
34052 thats why im in the nfl man because i scrap
34053 i wouldnt be here if i didnt scrap if i didnt scrap id be working a job somewhere
34054 im fearful that my outings put my season in jeopardy
34055 i just thought it was something i was going to have to deal with as i get older
34056 i got carried away it wasnt intentional i was excited it was a big spot for us
34057 i think hes been a good presence in the bullpen and with him at the back end the ninth inning guys know their roles
34058 and i think the defense is important evan longoria a rookie of the year candidate is pretty solid at third and they moved akinori iwamura who i thought was a gold glove third baseman to second where they say hes even better
34059 honey if you ever hope to marry some day i would never under any circumstances put on or remove that garment in front of any decent man
34060 ahll drive well yall would sober up pretty fast too
34061 ohhh so this is how unbearable mothers in law are made
34062 the under mummy resembles a dessicated burnt jet li and the terra cotta outer shell resembles jet li in a more stylized way the idea that director rob cohen had was that it would be like a russian nested doll
34063 we also shot a clean pass of the set and then a pass with jet li in it you notice that when an actor is in a scene the movement of the camera is more believable
34064 its better to rotoscope an environment rather than use greenscreen
34065 you cant beat the real lighting cues that make a cg character sit in a scene
34066 we made a model look like jet first and then we started dessicating it
34067 displacement maps were then taken from z brush and put onto a lower resolution cage to add back all that detail in renderman
34068 he added all the specular hits the ambient occlusion and beautiful subsurface scattering on the thinner pieces of skin
34069 after we ran through the animation process the shot would go through an effects process
34070 we have a pipeline that brings all the character geometry into side effects houdini once it was in houdini our effects lead brian gazdik worked on all the cracking and shattering a simulation was created on the surface of the characters face it was an interesting technique because based upon the deforming geometry the animation was driving the surface simulation the director wanted to have something that would crack and re seal but still reveal the subtleties of the animation happening underneath so our effects people would take this deforming geometry the animation coming from maya and calculate stress maps to determine how much of an area of the face was moving during a particular length of time through that they would run the simulation so that wed have areas that were fully intact only when they hit a certain threshold of stress or flex would it crack along a seam it was a physically based simulation that had artistic user input on where events would happen it was a mix of articulate hand animation and some meticulous procedural work procedural work only goes so far there was a lot of hand tweaking
34071 we wanted to come up with something that was physically based that you could believe was super heated terracotta
34072 it had to be based on something you could relate to like a hot piece of clay thats glowing these effects including fine wispy smoke and embers coming off the face were pretty much all houdini effects and all hand done
34073 the director specifically wanted to see imperfections burning off which happens when youre firing clay he wanted to see embers come flying off the face help the audience understand the physics of what was going on when the face reseals and you see the expression on the face that has to translate to the outer terra cotta shell
34074 there were so many layers required to give us what we needed in compositing
34075 they got combined through a customized nuke macro that we affectionately called pimp my mummy it was put together by one of our look development compositors chia chi hu it combined all the layers and allowed us access to color sliders and color controls we had one input node that all had the layers in it that got fed into pimp my mummy which split all those layers and assigned controls to each of them so we could dial the subsurface scattering separately without having to dig through the layers we spent a lot of time in compositing addressing a lot of the lighting issues by adjusting the different passes all within the interface that chia chi put together for this show
34076 there were times when we had our supervisors or the director sit with an artist and dial in the controls interactively that kind of time saving was invaluable
34077 you cant do that by just iterating and iterating you can cover seven or 10 iterations with one interactive session what used to be just the toy of the cappuccino steeped flame elite is now in the hands of us humble compositors

34115 i knew that hes a tougher opponent on hard court than he is on clay so i was a little bit nervous but as the match went on i played pretty well in the beginning though i lost my concentration in the second set

34222 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
34223 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
34224 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
34225 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
34226 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
34227 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
34228 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
34229 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
34230 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
34231 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
34232 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
34233 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
34234 we clearly are looking at an afghanistan where results are mixed the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could

34240 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
34241 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
34242 to enable tonga to make the next step in its democratic transition is important for tonga and a wonderful thing for the pacific
34243 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
34244 we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
34245 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population
34246 i cant be caught thats one thing i cannot be caught im too advanced and too smart
34247 each and every mujahid belongs to this very soil of india
34248 i spent a lot of time and money trying to live a sustainable life eating natural foods and doing natural things it just didnt make sense to me that i was going to draw a line before i died
34249 here we have woven willow these are certified woven bamboo
34250 this is a new product its called cradle its a beautiful cotton padded quilt
34251 its completely biodegradable so this breaks down in the earth really quickly trade show
34252 i had a chance to look at the wicker caskets its something that really hasnt reached the market yet
34253 we saw it at the trade show theres been some articles on the wicker casket
34254 the bed doesnt go up and down someone is going to have to walk up right up to the edge of the wicker casket and look at their loved one inside of it
34255 when we have a visitation now we can raise someone up and tilt them
34256 you can be kind of across the room and still see what they look like
34257 this particular urn is designed so that you place the remains in here and then theres a door that is sealed to there
34258 you place it in the water it could be the ocean could be a lake could be a river
34259 this provides a protection so that the soil doesnt quickly settle causing maybe a safety issue
34260 green isnt a fad green isnt an ideal green isnt a fancy fairy tale in the sky green is sustainable because sustainable works over the long run
34261 were trying to come to an agreement thats not only for this year but for years to come
34262 theres been constructive dialogue from both sides im cautiously optimistic well come to an agreement
34263 no because we generate in fact globally something like 60 70 of all the revenue and we share in that to the tune of no more than 14 if we were to sell our own rights globally exclusively wed generate a much larger number but thats not the way the olympic movement works we share
34264 i am extremely sorry i did it but i think the reaction is completely overstated
34265 we are here today because we are committed to letting the people of ohio know how important their support for the renewal of the clean ohio program is to ohios future success
34266 its not like spending something thats going to be here today and gone tomorrow
34267 this is not just a hope weve proven that this works
34268 i dont think theres going to be anything on the ballot that has the broad based bipartisan support that this has
34269 its another very important test obviously when you lose a couple its puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
34270 that puts a bit of an extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine
34271 so its very important test theres always a lot of tension in every test you are involved in particularly the big ones australia south africa and a number of others so theres always a lot of tension around a test match and thats the way it should be
34272 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations dead right
34273 we have put our bets foot forward this week the guys have trained well and they are very focused they have been very focused right through the six test matches we have played this year i couldnt ask any more of them
34274 as a group they are really trying to do the business whether we are good enough we cant do any more than we are doing
34275 we are building as a team hopefully we have built enough to have a very good performance at the weekend
34276 our extremely dedicated and hard working staff are particularly busy at the moment
34277 thats preferable to sending mothers and babies to other centres but its something we sometimes have to do
34278 for most of the year most units have spare capacity but things tend to get a little bit tight at this time
34279 sometimes babies have to be looked after in another region or even australia in very rare cases but that doesnt mean the system has failed
34280 much of it is dependent on how much water they can continue to take out of the hillside because it is the water pressure building up and creating the subsidence

34283 john mccain his attacks on barack obama not true false baloney the low road baseless
34284 it has gone and hit the edge of the channel and is stuck waiting for the next high tide
34285 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
34286 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination
34287 darwin will now be the strategic pivot for the growth of our asian strategy with our short haul fleet of a320 aircraft
34288 i hope that we can work out something far better than the other plan
34289 there goes germany were going to have to get to 270 without germany

34291 in the libertarian leaning west where pauls message of distrust of the federal government and ardent individualism played particularly well there is talk of republicans straying from mccain libertarian candidate bob barr has emerged as a favorite alternative for paul activists followed by constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin
34292 paul placed second ahead of mccain in republican caucuses in nevada and montana he posted strong showings in nominating contests in colorado washington and oregon in early june he pulled away 14 percent of the vote from the already certain nominee in the new mexico primary
34293 those are lies i do not comment on any longer

34303 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
34304 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
34305 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today

34313 the problem with the libs is not personality or even structure its policy
34314 such a change in department leadership was necessary following the mishandling of the 311 information hotline and crime camera programs
34315 completed an assessment and review of the crime cameras installed by the citys information technology department
34316 i made it clear in my state of the city address that 200 crime cameras would be operational by the end of july no excuses
34317 one of the companies we hired to install and maintain a significant number of cameras walked off the job
34318 we will continue to integrate this technology in our law enforcement efforts
34319 due to weather and environmental issues that can negatively impact the technology of the crime cameras the devices are monitored to ensure recording mechanisms are working
34320 the panel has been asked for a months extension on that review weve had over 700 submissions and the panel is working through those submissions
34321 senator carr is looking forward to the report being released this extension does not alter the governments intention to issue a white paper response by christmas

34335 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
34336 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
34337 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s

34384 despite this statement no hamas prisoner has been released until this evening by the fatah in the west bank
34385 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
34386 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
34387 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
34388 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
34389 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
34390 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
34391 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
34392 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
34393 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
34394 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
34395 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
34396 we must also be prepared to act quickly to secure those weapons and materials in cases where a state loses control of its weapons especially nuclear devices
34397 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as 4 who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
34398 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
34399 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hairdye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
34400 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one

34440 it should be the same thing for buses people should be safer on the bus because now i dont feel safe
34441 a lot of people have talked about airport style security but the rural nature of our network doesnt allow us to have that type of security
34442 i also want to acknowledge the driver and the other passengers on the bus
34443 housing and equity markets have weakened further in 2008 and this will inevitably lead to a further deterioration in household net worth

34445 the department takes its responsibilities to protect this information very seriously and has for some time been engaged in a broad programme of work to enhance the effectiveness of its information security controls
34446 the department acknowledges the concern that there have been a small number of breaches of data security in recent years the department can assure the public that it treats any unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal data to be an extremely serious offence
34447 all civil servants are subject to the official secrets act as well as departmental data protection policies
34448 all allegations of breaches are fully investigated and any staff member found to have breached the departments data protection policies and procedures is subject to the highest disciplinary sanction up to and including dismissal
34449 the department controls more personal information about irish citizens than any other body in the state but little reassurance has been provided in light of todays disturbing report
34450 the minister and her department failed to outline exactly what measures are being taken to address the failures how far they are along in the process of securing sensitive personal data and what steps will be taken next
34451 we cannot wait until there is a catastrophic breach of security to act and i will be calling on the minister and her department to address the social and family affairs committee that sits through the summer as soon as possible
34452 the largest category of complaint relates to allegations of abuse of authority the number of complaints of this nature rising by two percentage points when compared with 2006 34 per cent to 36 per cent
34453 you have to get proof of these things and its very very difficult you get cases where you cant tell whos telling the truth you get a garda saying i wasnt discourteous and the member of the public saying he or she was we cant decide in that and we generally find no breach of discipline
34454 treatment of advanced cancer that is meant to prolong life or change the course of this disease is not a covered benefit of the oregon health plan
34455 taxpayer dollars are limited for publicly funded programs we try to come up with polices that provide the most good for the most people
34456 but theres some desire on the part of the framers of this list to not cover treatments that are futile or where the potential benefit to the patient is minimal in relation to the expense of providing the care
34457 we wont pay for the drugs that might prolong your life but we offer help with assisted suicide
34458 every assistance is given by the various state agencies so that the company can adapt to the changing market conditions

34509 fishermen bring the creatures ashore with their flippers pierced and tied with straw they are routinely dragged on to boat ramps and turned on their backs and left to suffer for days in the hot sun

34537 a new shipment of basmati rice just arrived so theyre going crazy with the stuff back there
34538 well that sounds precious mums but well be having the pork chops and applesauce tonight
34539 could we get some of them rice balls as an appetizer perhaps
34540 not everyone is trying to steal me away from you stacie galaxies why do you have to be such a princess some people are just friendly yknow
34541 i know where this is going i know what youre about to do well you can be sure im not going to just sit here and take it im breaking up with you pre emptively
34542 well i thought we were but have it your way
34543 say what youre going to say just finish before the pork chops come theres nothing like a big ol meal to mend a broken heart my gramma used to say
34544 hopefully if youll just listen it wont come to that
34545 well this is something i thought of while up on stage today you remember during the power wars before we had the orbital solar panels in place when the chinese sent those huge mono filament nets across the pacific and took down our wind turbines
34546 you were on stage when the electricity went out playing that song you wrote for me
34547 you made such a fool of yourself just to finish my song thats when i knew it was true love
34548 well i hate to tell you this stace but that wasnt for you
34549 there is another woman theres always been another woman hasnt there
34550 stacie wait a moment you were listening so well can i finish
34551 the performance making a fool of myself that was for me love
34552 i was up there yknow just wailing on my bass when bam the lights go out the speakers pop amp die mike stops singing and the crowd sounds about to panic and i was feeling it i was feeling that music and there werent no way i could stop it coming out thats why i did what i did
34553 thats why i went to the edge of the stage and screamed my bass solo acapella for you into the darkness i simply knew that i had to do something someone had to do something or the crowd was gonna panic and that something i needed to do was already inside me straining to get out it was an expression of my personal power as nietzsche would put it
34554 thats beautiful hugh i never knew but if you feel that strongly about your music why are you thinking about giving up on it
34555 but listen stace now im starting to feel something else inside me straining to get out
34556 now dont get me wrong it aint another woman i feel the call to national service stacie just like i did up on that stage two years ago i feel that this is the thing that i must do now
34557 the world wouldnt work if they didnt have us kids to enslave into national service
34558 how true that is and it may be brainwashing youre right all those childhood lessons in being compassionate cooperative and maintaining personal responsibility for our society amp its impact on the entire globe that could very easily be brainwashing
34559 but it isnt just us kids that make national service work some people stay in their entire lives and the skills learned in national service they are useful to the entire populace for the rest of your life like what if the indo chinese tried to invade again not that they would weve given them too much but if they did every woman amp man in this city in our society is at least trained to defend themselves because of national service
34560 but youre not a killer huey is that what you really want to become
34561 galaxies no but id like to be able to seriously hurt someone if they were trying to harm you
34562 but how can you do that if youre half way around the globe why do you have to go so far away from me
34563 actually i was just reading that the travel abroad is more of a tradition than a rule keeps us from getting too isolated too tribalized but if i wanted to i could come back here after basic training theres plenty of infrastructure to work on here just like everywhere else

34570 jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of hazael and elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of jehu
34571 he had thought god too slow in avenging his dishonoured name and had been taught the might of gentleness but now he also learns the certainty of punishment while the enigmatical promise that elisha should slay those who escaped the swords of hazael and jehu dimly points to the merciful energy of that prophets word his only sword which shall slay but to revive and wound to heal
34572 with this promise he knew that ultimately justice would be done and god would not allow the institutionalized persecution and promotion of idolatry to go unpunished

34588 the important part to me what the idea of distributing work which i found challenging or unusual a means of putting people in contact with folks who they might not otherwise know and getting exposed to work which might be outside of their normal reading patterns at least that was the idea too often it seems though i was publishing work which is greeted by apathy and silence print runs of housepress titles were usually between 40 and 100 copies with modest cover prices it was my hope that the prices were never too high to be prohibitive to any reader and if anyone showed an interest in seeing a piece but could not afford a copy or preferred to trade i rarely declined but recently about the last two years when i announced online and through email that new titles were available i received a pitiful number of orders usually between 2 and 5 copies per chapbook and even fewer inquiries or letters of interest and in some cases the authors themselves didnt acknowledge that their titles were published it was never about the money or sales with housepress i was solely interested in getting the work out there in editions that were crafted with care and attention it is this apathy which has convinced me that housepress no longer serves the function that i hoped for these frustrations have lead me to believe that its best that i close housepress its been a good run but unfortunately its no longer fun and this style of work is supposed to be fun i continue to be passionate about the small press in canada but at this time i can no longer participate as a publisher sorry folks
34589 when fitzpatrick does refer to landscape the vocabulary of reference is unhinged through an alienating context does a rivat river rival geographically drain into or flow from a force serv trict ducat lake

34603 existing rules and understandings that stem from an outside source such as state law
34604 employees and employers have an interest in their employment relations which the fifth amendment protects from arbitrary government interference regardless of whether the same employees and employers may dissolve their relationship at will
34605 once used almost exclusively to dispose of minor cases against individual offenders dpas have become a standard means of resolving major corporate investigations
34606 because the united states constitution regulates only the government not private parties a litigant claiming that his constitutional rights have been violated must first establish that the challenged conduct constitutes state action
34607 there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action
34608 has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement either overt or covert that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the state
34609 the government both through the thompson memorandum and the actions of the united states attorneys office quite deliberately coerced and in any case significantly encouraged kpmg to pressure its employees to surrender their fifth amendment rights
34610 it is undisputed that appellees interest in the right to continue to serve as president of the bank and to participate in the conduct of its affairs is a property right protected by the fifth amendment due process clause
34611 a property interest in employment can be created by local ordinance or by implied contract
34612 a protectable property interest may arise in a situation where an employee may be removed only for cause
34613 an essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life liberty or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case

34629 hey self theyre just words just silly little letters put together to form a few sound waves in order to convey meaning shit sounded pretty darn good with that sentence you just blurted out at nolan for clogging up the toilet again so you were just making it all sound so phonetically pleasing and of course using the word in proper context this time no biggie

34631 then a year later i got the chance to work on a

34633 i go to places like the 99 cents only store in reseda or other hispanic working class neighborhoods in the valley parks are good too its the only street food l a can really claim as its own
34634 its illegal and yet its a ubiquitous part of l a culture
34635 honestly i can tell you ive been a working person all my life ive worked since i was 9 years old
34636 i dont like being bothered i dont like being arrested never in my life had i been to jail and they threw me in jail for violating the laws of the health department
34637 they told me the mayor wants to make this area like new york times square but i told them who told him we want that the people who come here are not like that ninety nine percent of the people here are mexicanos here you dont really see americanos one or two
34638 why are they coming now to get us out of here why the abuse why the abuse

34645 the cholos were coming here to charge us the fifth and hill gang but theyve never come near me
34646 well once a cholo came and said to me what if maybe i come and tax you and i said without thinking what if maybe you go fuck yourself he started at me then never came back

34900 no peace process will be achieved either in this year or the expected years israel backed by america is not intended to give the palestinian people their basic demand by establishment of an independent state and for this reason we resorted to the military activities in order to push the occupation and to make an end by our alternative method
34901 please do not respond to questions or make any statements
34902 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement we have recovered a four page letter in which he describes his feelings and the reason that he claims that he committed these offenses

34905 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence weve been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices theyre worried about home foreclosures so the reason that i thought this trip was important was i am convinced that many of the issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad
34906 the conviction gives his victims hope that he will soon be brought to justice for his crimes in haiti that included the murder and rape and other torture of thousands more
34907 we strongly condemn this decision by the defense ministry to allow new settlements in the west bank in the jordan valley this is not the interest of the israeli people and the israeli public to have new settlements while we are having negotiations with the palestinians about having the two states
34908 certainly there were commentators and others pundits at fox news that were helpful to the white house and then certainly yeah certainly we got talking points to those people
34909 did you use did people say call sean call bill call whoever did you do that as a regular thing
34910 certainly certainly it wasnt necessarily something i was doing but it was something that we at the white house yes were doing and getting them talking points and making sure they knew where we were coming from
34911 no no this is important you were using these commentators as your spokespeople
34912 well certainly i mean certainly i think that happens both ways when people go on other networks as well that are favorable towards the democrats and so forth

34922 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
34923 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
34924 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
34925 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
34926 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
34927 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

34936 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
34937 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
34938 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
34939 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
34940 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
34941 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
34942 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote
34943 you mean you really think hes an extremist i mean hes clearly liberal
34944 oh i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
34945 btselem received this morning footage filmed in the village of nilin approximately two weeks ago showing an israeli soldier firing a rubber coated steal bullet at a palestinian the palestinian has his hands tied behind his back and his eyes covered and the soldier is firing at him from very close range from approximately a meter and a half away this whole event happens in the presence of a high ranking officer a lieutenant colonel
34946 i know going awol was wrong but i thought it was the best way to stop the small kill teams

34968 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
34969 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
34970 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
34971 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
34972 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
34973 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
34974 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
34975 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
34976 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
34977 if it was done to me i would think it was torture
34978 you know you may acknowledge these laws or not but these laws exist
34979 are there weapons of mass destruction in iraq and are there connections between al qaeda and saddam hussein

34985 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
34986 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
34987 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace
34988 why have we come to rely on private contractors to provide combat or combat related security training for our forces
34989 mr hamdan or any accused at guantanamo but for right now mr hamdan if he is convicted he will stay at guantanamo bay if he is acquitted completely hell stay at guantanamo bay and if hes convicted and he gets lets say time served hes going to stay at guantanamo bay because the government has stated through their prosecutor mr murphy that regardless of what outcome in this case theyre allowed to detain mr hamdan for the duration of the global war on terrorism
34990 were in danger of losing our country to a war based on lies to destruction of our civil liberties but its your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save whats right and save whats dear to us but were going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again
34991 theres no question about it wall street got one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

34994 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
34995 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
34996 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes
34997 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone
34998 i would rather speak at a rally or a gathering any place outside the united states after i am president of the united states but thats a judgment that senator obama and the american people will make
34999 i feel like justice has been served and in all truth this war criminal the oppressor known as luciano benjamin menendez is going to rot in jail which is exactly what he deserves
35000 the bottom line here is that weve shifted money to help the democratically elected government of pakistan to fight a common foe a common enemy that we have we believe that these upgrades that had already been approved will help the pakistanis us it will help the pakistanis help us fight this common foe and that we believe that this is a positive way to help a friend
35001 we consider this day as a black day in the history of iraqi sport it is a black day as it terminates all the aspirations of the iraqi athletes and their hopes to achieve personal records iraqi records and records for their national unions all these hopes have come to an end this day because of this decision which is done not by iraqi hands but by foreign hands

35008 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
35009 contrary to everything the canadian public has been told about omar khadr the tapes do not show a dangerous terrorist but instead a frightened wounded canadian boy pleading for help from canadian officials instead of helping they casually dismiss his claims of abuse and mistreatment and tell him that they will do nothing for him
35010 we are hoping that the canadian public will recognize that you put aside any concerns of guilt or innocence that has to be determined in a properly constituted court which of course is not guantanamo bay and look at compassion as we feel the children have a special significance in society this kid has suffered enough this kid needs to come home this kid is not a terrorist
35011 i heard somebody say well its going to take seven years well if wed have done it seven years ago wed be having a different conversation today im not suggesting wed have completely created a you know changed the dynamics in the world but it certainly would have been wed have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas
35012 this war diminishes our security our standing in the world our military our economy and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the twenty first century by any measure our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction and to seize this moments promise

35018 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
35019 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation
35020 its 7 00 in the morning its time for him to get up smell the coffee and know the american people are sick and tired of war were already in one quagmire in iraq we dont want another one in iran
35021 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

35030 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
35031 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
35032 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
35033 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
35034 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested
35035 as we sign this memorandum of understanding we all commit ourselves to the first tentative step towards searching for a solution to the country that is in a crisis
35036 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
35037 i crossed an artificial line today because appalachia is my homeland and its life is being destroyed far faster than it can regenerate
35038 they handcuffed me and placed me under the sun for about three hours then they picked me up walked me for a little bit and shot at me i found myself on the ground they told me we are going to fire a rubber bullet at you and i did not imagine that this is how they were going to act to open fire at me while i am handcuffed
35039 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality

35045 irans will and authority to the enemies that have threatened iran with harsh language in recent weeks
35046 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
35047 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
35048 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
35049 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
35050 we have great confidence that the political leadership in iraq would not take an action that would destabilize the country
35051 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that im flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me ive been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow thats me trying to look like im you know more centered more centrist is just not true dont assume that if i dont agree with you on something that it must be because im doing that politically i may just disagree with you

35053 the chinese government is using the opportunity of hosting olympics to showcase the china that the chinese government wants the world to see and cover up the china that the chinese government does not want the outside to see so we came here to reveal this china to the other side of the world and more than that we have to send a message to the international community
35054 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

35063 interpreting after the largest ice raid in us history a personal account
35064 then began the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see because cameras were not allowed past the perimeter of the compound driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10 they appeared to be uniformly no more than 5 ft tall mostly illiterate guatemalan peasants with mayan last names some in tears others with faces of worry fear and embarrassment
35065 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river
35066 please dont tell anybody because ill be placed in quarantine and i wont be able to support my family

35069 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
35070 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
35071 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
35072 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
35073 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
35074 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
35075 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
35076 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change
35077 the ticket was for trespassing he said if i came back into the plaza i would be arrested and taken to jail the sign says mccain bush now in a republican event why is that offensive why would republicans who voted for bush find it offensive that a sign says bush mccain or mccain bush

35080 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
35081 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
35082 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
35083 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
35084 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
35085 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
35086 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
35087 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
35088 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
35089 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
35090 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation

35097 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems
35098 you know what if lenders go outside of their responsibilities they can be sued they can have to pay out they can lose certain amounts of money that they have counted on
35099 we dont like that we dont like to be accountable for what were doing
35100 we were able to do this because of these unregulated swaps
35101 you know what heres 300 billion to the federal housing association and they will be able to effectively insure those mortgages to the lenders
35102 you know were going to help you the banking system get through the mess you created and you know what we want more power to basically regulate you in the future because we didnt do it enough to begin with during the last few years while all of these problems were brewing
35103 i believe the man we need to meet the mortal need today is here he is experienced but has not lost his common sense or his ability to be outraged his conservatism is not the result of a studied philosophy but of common sense and personal observation his name is john mccain he might not be the right president for all times but he is the right president for these times
35104 well we cant let bear stearns fail because then all these people will lose their jobs and well have a domino effect
35105 ok well were going to help you out but were going to demand that you act more responsibly and were going to demand that you let us see what youre doing
35106 you know were not just going to help a few homeowners right now we need to change the entire system we need to make it transparent we need to make the legislation enforceable and we need to bring some control into whats going on and understanding of what we need to be looking for

35109 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
35110 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
35111 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus
35112 well you know if you want to do that we have other people that can fill in and take your place very quickly

35137 well thats not my dream i want to come back because gaza is my home and i want to be a voice for the voiceless
35138 do you think those people are going to help you

35147 listen its none of your business dont tell the dutch that mohammed is in this car just take him to the hospital and thats it dont tell anybody about what happened
35148 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future

35158 i kept playing the movie over in my head many times had i been pressured had i been stubborn today with the perspective of years behind me i feel it was my destiny i feel that i had to live through what i lived through that i had to find out what i found out i have a ph d in the farc that i hope will be useful to those of us who want to help with all this i think there are moments in life in which one is at a crossroads between what one wants to do and what one has to do
35159 i dont want to answer that question from an emotional perspective because this is such a big blow to the farc that it would be easy to say that the farc is destroyed i simply want to give you testimony of what i lived through since a year ago it has been hard for supplies to arrive we have had little to eat very little variety in the food no fruit no greens thats a signal that the logistics could be going through difficulty
35160 mindless u s support of a regime that tacitly allowed paramilitary groups to function should not be applauded nor should the hundreds of trade union leaders that have been murdered during the uribe presidency be forgotten
35161 i would like to see our continued assistance to countries like colombia and mexico we have just reached an agreement with mexico to try to do what is best for america and that would be to stem the flow of cocaine
35162 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

35170 that position has not changed i have not equivocated on that position i am not searching for maneuvering room with respect to that position
35171 i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term
35172 likely be able to determine the viewing and video uploading habits of youtubes users
35173 we have contributed the least to climate change but we are carrying the heavy burden of solving the climate change problem and so we would like them to ensure that we are included in the negotiations of the climate change convention so that we can contribute more substantially in shaping solutions
35174 the reality is in africa every single day 6 000 people die from hiv aids alone another 7 000 people die from malaria another 2 000 3 000 die from tuberculosis if those numbers of deaths were happening in europe or north america we are convinced the g8 would long time ago have found the money to address these issues so we want to see the same kind of urgency
35175 crime rates and irresponsibility among negroes are a fact of life which must be faced

35187 i appreciate that republicans and democrats in congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from iraq
35188 through these initial offers we hope to increase production of these oilfields to about 1 5 million barrels per day in addition to current production which is 2 5 million barrels per day the ministry is seeking to increase production from now until contracts are put into effect until it reaches 4 5 million barrels per day in the next five years

35213 the israelis certainly lost that war they did not get their prisoners back not until now and theyre getting them back dead more than 1 000 lebanese civilians and more than 160 israelis most of them soldiers all died for absolutely nothing and thats what todays prisoner exchanges prove

35215 it is a palpable demonstration that we can negotiate like brothers that we can trust that we can advance together that we can overcome this silliness of competition between nations so we can advance together the cooperation between nations
35216 when the officer confessed his mistake to his superiors he said that as the helicopter was landing he saw such a quantity of guerrillas that he became very nervous and that he was afraid for his life and that he took out of his pocket the piece of cloth with the symbol of the international red cross committee logo that he carried in his pocket and put it on his bulletproof vest we regret that this has occurred
35217 when a public system fails repeatedly to meet these minimal objectives parents ask only for a choice in their education of their children some parents some parents may choose a better public school some may choose a private school many will choose a charter school no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity

35224 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
35225 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
35226 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
35227 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
35228 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

35238 how can things change if all that comes out of iraq are sanitized white washed images of war designed for mainstream media outlets who focus on making money not on the quality and truth in what they report
35239 im not worried about my own safety im here to do my job im here to document
35240 well theres nothing in the embed rules that say you cant show someone whos identifiable as a marine it says no identifiable features you know to identify that person from you know another person but actually showing an injured soldier or a dead soldier is not something that is barred in the embed rules
35241 by posting the images and your commentary you violated 14 h and o of the news media agreement you signed
35242 by providing detailed information of the effectiveness of the attack and response of us forces to it you have put all us forces in iraq at greater risk for harm

35277 its the strangest thing government keeps hiring even when times are tough
35278 what scares me is this problem may not be deep but it could last a long time
35279 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
35280 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
35281 when i was laying on my back i was getting emails from fans for one actually mad at me for having my throat go out
35282 and not to mention you know once we did start working in the studio it just started coming to me that here we are you know shuffling this material back and forth and the label of course always has their fingers in it it just got to a point where i was like you know when does it become enough when can i just not give away any more of my soul and its acceptable
35283 the story of the election through the summer months has been a close race that simply does not seem to want to change obama has generally been in the lead and it is significant that mccain has never held even a 1 point lead among registered voters in gallup poll daily tracking since obama clinched the democratic nomination in early june still the relative stability of the race even in the aftermath of such a high visibility event as obamas foreign trip coupled of course with the mccain campaigns vigorous efforts to defuse its impact continues to suggest that it may be the conventions in late august and early september that will offer the next potential timeframe for significant and or sustained change
35284 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
35285 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
35286 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
35287 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
35288 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
35289 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
35290 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats

35296 i wasnt sure what i was going to do with my swimming career after this year
35297 now im going to continue at least another year maybe two maybe more
35298 i knew i could definitely be in the top two to make the team
35299 that gave christine a much clearer view of what she was capable of
35300 but what has made her stand out is her consistent attitude about working hard in practice every day
35301 it keeps her more horizontal in the water especially coming off the turn at a time when other swimmers who are tired find it hard to lift their head to breathe
35302 i believe she will swim faster at the olympic games
35303 she will tell a joke and there will be this silence and her teammates will say thats awkward
35304 free mike vick t shirt he wore under his game jersey last year
35305 i just wish they hadnt fined me 10 000 the fourth year atlanta falcons receiver said with a smile thursday
35306 too bad they didnt cut me a break on that but mikes a good guy and hes always been my friend
35307 free mike vick as he dressed in the georgia dome locker room before a blowout loss to new orleans
35308 since mike got locked up kevin has visited him a lot white said
35309 the thing about mike is when i got here he took me in under his wing and he told me that no matter what i would be a pro bowler one day
35310 you may see it all but by the time the ball is snapped and you start to run your route something has changed robiskie said
35311 roddy finally realized not only to recognize that change from the defense but to react as fast as it was happening joe really opened his eyes as far as his understanding of the game went
35312 hes commanding the huddle which is always a good thing for a young quarterback white said
35313 hes coming in there and putting guys in the right spots when we make a mistake he can point it out and tell us where to go
35314 now were just waiting for him to get out there in that first preseason game and show what he can do
35315 i look back and i just feel i cheated myself
35316 sometimes i didnt prepare the way i should people have always told me zab if you were just in a little better shape nobody could beat you i cheated myself a lot i didnt get myself in great shape like i should have been but now im here
35317 i see a lot of great fighters in this game that only got one opportunity and you worry about that i know theres not too many more opportunities so the one that ive got im going to capitalize off of it
35318 i call myself lucky lefty no matter what happens i somehow come back and find myself at the top again
35319 not to downplay joshua clottey but i feel like ive been in the ring with more of the elite fighters more of the best fighters
35320 hes a methodical fighter very one dimensional hes never fought somebody like me
35321 i wait and wait for this fight and finally i have it
35322 its my time to be a champion its not zabs time anymore
35323 paradise lost presents us a viola introduction with a gypsy reminiscence which fast changes into some sort of late intro by the whole orchestra a perfect interlude to prepare us for the next track but nothing can prepare the listener for the radical change in

35325 so im quite surprised and actually upset that shed find another home in the public sector especially in homeland security
35326 this is an opportunity for ken to play for a first place team
35327 we hope it works out for him our ownership and fans appreciate the contributions he made to the organization and to our city in the time he was in cincinnati
35328 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
35329 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
35330 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations

35337 there was this boy from the mountains who wouldnt shower because he was afraid of showering with the rest of us
35338 after a while this old boy began to stink our sergeant said if we didnt convince this guy to shower then thered be k p for the whole unit
35339 one night a bunch of us grabbed him hauled him into the shower and scrubbed him down with some lye soap and a wire brush he showered every day after that
35340 what do you want me to do about it shes a girl im a guy a woman needs to talk to her
35341 i told her if she didnt start using deodorant i would grab her by the ear and throw her in the river

35343 he did what all of our guards do and kept walking
35344 we suffer primarily from our illusions we are haunted not by reality but by those images we have put in place of reality america went to war nearly five years ago after an orchestrated campaign of false statements by the nations top officials a war begun under the illusion of an imminent national security threat we are haunted by a war begun in other words under false pretenses

35359 if we can both do that its going to be positive for everybody
35360 being around a good group guys who had the camaraderie these guys had i watched them all through the playoffs that was neat to see man
35361 you dont see that at this level you see it in college and high school there are no selfish guys seemed like the place i wanted to be
35362 survival man i was just trying to get back to my kids
35363 weve seen a run of softer data and we also started seeing the reserve bank make noises about the fact they were happy with the current policy settings
35364 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
35365 we still think petrol prices have been the biggest issue weakening retail trade
35366 the terms of trade remains the biggest factor against a rate cut in the near term
35367 the extent of problems in the credit market are going to cause issues for businesses and households to obtain credit and thats going to help ease domestic expenditure
35368 the crime has signs of premeditation mohamed ali called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it said

35370 the suncorp announcement this morning is having an impact across the financial sector further dampening confidence
35371 uncertainty continues to linger particularly over the financial and industrial sectors
35372 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
35373 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
35374 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
35375 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy
35376 were thrilled about this honor from idsa that we believe recognizes the innovation resulting from our partnership with ideo and the various design and manufacturing partners involved with coasting
35377 the collaborative network behind this program was genius ranging from ideos designers working with shimanos product development team to our trusted oem partners giant raleigh and trek
35378 were delighted for this recognition as we feel the experience ideo helped shimano create has achieved shimanos goal of getting more people on bikes
35379 we started with a reference design of what we thought the bicycle should look like and after showing it to bicycle manufacturers and working closely with shimano we ultimately created a new category in the bicycle industry that has been well received
35380 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
35381 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsay lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
35382 i am not ashamed of what i do everybody benefits from the paparazzi retail hotels tourism
35383 as a professional athlete a part of the job is inspiring and educating other women in some cases that goes beyond the bike
35384 i love seeing women out riding who are healthy and happy by raising awareness of ovarian cancer we have a chance to reach a broad base of women with information that can save lives so there can be more women on their bikes embracing life
35385 benjamin proved that shes one of the most consistent riders on the domestic circuit with her overall win of the 2006 international cycling classic superweek
35386 benjamin is a powerful sprinter and in this year she could certainly deliver the win
35387 when you can combine your passion with helping achieve the greater good its an easy choice
35388 when you participate on your bike or sponsor events that initiate change in the world it becomes something more than a fun race or good marketing opportunity it has a very real impact on the lives of women and their families as sponsors were able to reach beyond the boundaries of the cycling community and deliver a message of hope
35389 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
35390 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
35391 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
35392 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
35393 how do i differentiate my service gain client confidence and provide a better service that will knock my clients socks off
35394 we can do this one of two ways i can come in and tell you everything about my company and how great we are or we can roll up our sleeves and really get to the heart of your hiring issues so that you and i can determine if together we can customize a solution for your company what do you want to spend our time doing
35395 when you benchmarked your top performers what were the common denominators that stood out
35396 drug dealers have stopped plying their wares boldly in the open as they once did and crack users no longer smoke where kids can easily see them break ins are also down
35397 there was a period where the airport dispatchers were running a scam in which theyd charge a flat fare of 450 baht but aot took over the concession and since then it appears to be clean again
35398 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
35399 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
35400 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
35401 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio
35402 i havent raced since the last day of the tour of italy and itll be good to get back into action
35403 ill have a tough time taking on the riders whove done the tour de france because their form will be better after hard racing in july
35404 above all the clasica is a vital test of my form in my build up to the olympic games and the tour of spain my big end of season objective
35405 it will be the first time ive ever ridden the clasica but i know its never easy
35406 for focus areas like finance and fitness i can see measurable 30k objectives weight lost school loans paid off but i struggle with other areas like relationships creativity or even spirituality i can understand the 40k vision of what these look like but as far as measurable goals to make up the vision i struggle i seem to have a gap at the 30k objectives level how would you coach someone through this situation
35407 i have made at least two close new friends whom i will know for years

35410 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
35411 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
35412 i mean normans was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
35413 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
35414 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
35415 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
35416 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
35417 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
35418 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
35419 its easy for people outside to read more into something than is actually there
35420 we did not have a huge falling out with activision or anything

35424 were going to nationalize bank of venezuela im calling on grupo santander to come and start negotiating
35425 they wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan banker and as head of state im saying no sell it to the government to the state
35426 were going to recuperate bank of venezuela were very much in need of a bank of that magnitude
35427 therell be headlines in the spanish press is chavez harming spain to undo the diplomatic relations weve just mended
35428 political events in venezuela pose an increased risk the venezuelan government might nationalize or in other ways intervene in the operations of our venezuelan subsidiary
35429 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along
35430 im not so sure those gains are sustainable exports are likely to slow with the slowdown in europe and japan
35431 consumers used the stimulus check more for basic necessities as opposed to more discretionary items
35432 as we have repeatedly said and cautioned against there will be further attacks
35433 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours this will ease the burden on our forces and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
35434 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
35435 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
35436 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
35437 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio
35438 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
35439 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
35440 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
35441 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
35442 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
35443 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
35444 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
35445 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
35446 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running
35447 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
35448 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
35449 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
35450 for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
35451 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
35452 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
35453 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence
35454 the impact for us obviously is we cant sail out or into the harbour while that ship is there
35455 the suncorp announcement this morning is having an impact across the financial sector further dampening confidence
35456 uncertainty continues to linger particularly over the financial and industrial sectors
35457 she got the job because she blitzed her screen test i mean i had no idea she was so good
35458 she walked into our office in sydney and read the part she has done some italian movies but i didnt think she would be as good as she was
35459 but once she read we all looked around at each other and said well theres no question
35460 with the support of the government the airport and local industry we can potentially re position darwin as a strategic transport hub into near asia mr joyce said today
35461 im supposed to get my kids vaccinated today what do you think should i do it
35462 which do you fear more these shot prevented diseases or autism
35463 when we go to fashionable lefty cocktail parties in venezuela its embarrassing to admit who signs our paychecks
35464 established the principle that even a former head of state who is alleged to have committed torture will not be able to gain immunity from the jurisdiction of courts
35465 absent strong growth in trade the economy would have turned negative in the second quarter contracting by 0 52 instead of growing 1 9
35466 moving to all electronic pay stubs is a common sense step for the federal government to take
35467 this legislation gives every federal employee the opportunity to receive their pay stub via a secure web site instead of in the mail it will save millions in taxpayer dollars dramatically reduce paper consumption and reduce the risk of identity theft for federal employees
35468 federal employees should be allowed the option of accessing their pay stubs electronically and this bill will allow them to do just that
35469 its time to make the process of receiving pay stubs faster safer and less costly to taxpayers
35470 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
35471 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
35472 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
35473 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
35474 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
35475 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
35476 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along
35477 im not so sure those gains are sustainable exports are likely to slow with the slowdown in europe and japan
35478 consumers used the stimulus check more for basic necessities as opposed to more discretionary items
35479 theres so much crap going on at a course from monday to wednesday im just not for it anymore
35480 i just arrive at the last minute play my practice round and get the tournament under way
35481 thats the only fairway i missed i tried to hit it to the fat side of the fairway and i came off it a little bit
35482 i pulled a muscle in my stomach and that takes a long time to heal i got that worked out and then i had a few issues with my shoulder but i think ive got it all cleared away
35483 i took a lot of time off and got my body a little more rested and played well today
35484 we have served him a written order asking him not to leave the country till his name is cleared by investigators
35485 a case has been registered in ahmedabad and under instructions from the gujarat police a look out notice has been served at all the land sea and air exit routes to stop the husband and wife if they try to flee the country
35486 he is definitely under our scanner as his name surfaced in a serious matter we are still looking into the matter and he has not been given a clean chit yet
35487 having served with the us army and the police one cannot believe that he was so na ve in operating and maintaining computer security and secrecy the us cops are trained to be very careful in such matters
35488 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
35489 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
35490 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
35491 unsurprisingly those behind the recent attacks continued today with new spam campaigns involving airline ticket invoices
35492 the e mails which purport to be from an airline thank the recipient for using a new
35493 yesterday we analyzed a sample of a new trojan called infostealer
35494 upon further investigation the trojan appears to be using the probably stolen credentials of a number of recruiters to login to the web site and perform searches for resumes of candidates located in certain countries or working in certain fields the trojan sends http commands to the monster com web site to navigate to the managed folders section it then parses the output from a pop up window containing the profiles of the candidates that match this recruiters saved searches
35495 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
35496 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
35497 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
35498 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
35499 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
35500 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
35501 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
35502 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
35503 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
35504 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
35505 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
35506 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
35507 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
35508 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
35509 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
35510 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
35511 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
35512 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
35513 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
35514 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
35515 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
35516 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
35517 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
35518 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
35519 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
35520 who are open to doing something on the production side
35521 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
35522 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
35523 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
35524 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
35525 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
35526 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
35527 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
35528 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
35529 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
35530 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
35531 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
35532 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
35533 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
35534 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
35535 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
35536 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
35537 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
35538 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
35539 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
35540 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
35541 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
35542 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
35543 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
35544 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
35545 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
35546 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
35547 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
35548 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
35549 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
35550 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
35551 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
35552 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
35553 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
35554 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
35555 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
35556 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
35557 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
35558 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
35559 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
35560 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
35561 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
35562 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
35563 todays decision in washington d c is very encouraging it is clear that the trial will begin and conclude prior to the general election this means that the senators innocence will be confirmed before alaskans go to the ballot box in november
35564 adam felt it was in his best interest and the phillies best interest to re establish himself as a guy who could start and he wasnt going to do that with the phillies i think he can do that and will do that i think adam thinks he would be in the phillies rotation next year but he knows he has to prove himself to the manager and the organization the best place for him to do what he needs to do is the minors
35565 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
35566 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
35567 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
35568 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
35569 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
35570 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
35571 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
35572 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
35573 theres a tremendous opportunity for energy efficiency and environmental improvements but influencing individual pc users is a very difficult thing to do
35574 the pc that sits under your desk at home or in the office kinda looks like a toaster to pg amp e
35575 half the energy that goes into it comes out as heat
35576 ive seen a statistic that one fifth of the internet traffic in the world passes through silicon valley and thats why we have the issues we have
35577 weve got around a billion people in the world using pcs right now
35578 if we get the other four to five billion hooked up then well really have an issue on our hands
35579 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
35580 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
35581 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
35582 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
35583 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
35584 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
35585 i am pleased that the judge has set a speedy trial date which should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
35586 we have a bill of rights and a trial by jury in our country to protect our citizens so that every person has their day in court
35587 we have served him a written order asking him not to leave the country till his name is cleared by investigators
35588 a case has been registered in ahmedabad and under instructions from the gujarat police a look out notice has been served at all the land sea and air exit routes to stop the husband and wife if they try to flee the country
35589 he is definitely under our scanner as his name surfaced in a serious matter we are still looking into the matter and he has not been given a clean chit yet
35590 having served with the us army and the police one cannot believe that he was so na ve in operating and maintaining computer security and secrecy the us cops are trained to be very careful in such matters
35591 i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbit hole and yet and rather curious you know this sort of life
35592 their guidance is quite conservative and we think that number could be almost 15 percent higher than that

35654 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
35655 during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
35656 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
35657 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
35658 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
35659 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
35660 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
35661 mars odyssey discovered this ice six years ago but weve now touched it and tasted it which is something that hasnt been done before

35664 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
35665 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
35666 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
35667 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic

35674 uh brad i just loaded google through your webproxy it would seem that your proxy server is open to the whole internet

35694 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing
35695 theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
35696 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
35697 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
35698 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
35699 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here its nice the field is still the same as it was in the past theres just one guy missing
35700 so really it should be just as exciting and good golf as theres been in the past
35701 i didnt capitalize on some opportunities that i had and didnt make as many birdies as i would have liked
35702 but i hit a lot of good shots drove the ball well and played aggressively throughout the day when i did get in trouble on a couple of holes i was able to get down and salvage par
35703 it was a risky play though because i couldnt hit it very high or it would hit the trees and if i hit it low it catches the rough and stays there
35704 so it was risky but it paid off because i was able to not only salvage par but i ended up making a birdie
35705 where i was coming from if you just land it in the right place you just know its going to be close and i was happy it went in
35706 the first time i missed the fairway was no 11 i think so i drove the ball well and scrambled a bit at the end
35707 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here its nice the field is still the same as it was in the past theres just one guy missing
35708 so really it should be just as exciting and good golf as theres been in the past
35709 i didnt capitalize on some opportunities that i had and didnt make as many birdies as i would have liked
35710 but i hit a lot of good shots drove the ball well and played aggressively throughout the day when i did get in trouble on a couple of holes i was able to get down and salvage par
35711 it was a risky play though because i couldnt hit it very high or it would hit the trees and if i hit it low it catches the rough and stays there
35712 so it was risky but it paid off because i was able to not only salvage par but i ended up making a birdie
35713 where i was coming from if you just land it in the right place you just know its going to be close and i was happy it went in
35714 the first time i missed the fairway was no 11 i think so i drove the ball well and scrambled a bit at the end

35718 omnisios editor was a working start but im sure theres still much more to improve in this space
35719 chances are that google was mostly interested in the talent at omnisio something they hint at in the announcement of the acquisition that mostly focuses on how great the expertise of the omnisio team is and less on the actual technology behind omnisio

35721 punished one sailendra prasad at his village lakshmanpur in berhampore as he married manera bibi
35722 after about six months in mumbai i met my future husband who worked there as a construction labourer we got married at a marriage registrars office but i did not tell my father that my husband belonged to a different community at the end of 2006 i brought my husband home to lakshmanpur he came under an assumed name as the village is very orthodox we stayed for 12 days and there was no problem
35723 my father had become old and could not work the family used to run on the meagre income of my brother who worked as an agricultural labourer so three years ago i was compelled to go to mumbai to work as a maid
35724 a shalishi meeting was arranged in the compound of the village primary school the same evening where my father took my husband from that night my husband was missing
35725 when they found he belonged to a different community they severely beat him up then the shalishi gave its verdict that the punishment for my husband was death as he had suppressed his religion and that he must be beheaded
35726 we learnt that almost everyone in the village knew about my fate on july 27 the three of us the siblings and their mother went to behrampore police
35727 we received a complaint against 10 persons launched an interrogation and raided the village we arrested three persons who had participated in the shalishi they confessed to their crime interrogating the arrested persons we came to know that four villagers had carried out the killing
35728 then he was carried inside the jute field by four villagers and beheaded
35729 shalishi sabhas have been operating for several years in our state what else can i say
35730 in bengal the government is allowing shalishi sabhas as it wants the parallel system of customs and pre modern society to continue
35731 village people care for others and believe that a shalishi sabha will render proper justice even courts had at times paid respect to decisions taken by such sabhas if an inter caste marriage can be settled through a shalishi sabha whats the need of a poor family to spend money in court
35732 we encouraged shalishis to keep people from defying societal norms we may be less educated but our village society has to be kept intact through informal courts we had lots of such sabhas
35733 their real face was uncovered after we recently arrested two lashkar persons from murshidabad district who were part of the ahl e hadis investigations revealed that this frontal organisation is also operating in a similar manner in bangladesh for the past few years
35734 one thing was clear during their interrogation that besides travelling to bangladesh the two suspects often frequented mumbai and ahmedabad
35735 they only concentrated in murshidabad and maldah districts because of the sheer multi connectivity advantages these two districts enjoy over other bordering districts
35736 at the same time from both these districts one can easily move out to bengals neighbouring state of jharkhand also murshidabad and maldah are the only two indo bangladesh bordering districts of bengal which have direct railways connectivity to major stations of howrah and sealdah
35737 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board said eric jackson a yahoo shareholder who plans to confront yang during fridays meeting
35738 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
35739 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders legg mason chairman bill miller said at the time
35740 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo said nelson a partner at mithras capital which owns 1
35741 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
35742 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship icahn wrote on his blog thursday
35743 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company yang told the associated press on july 22

35749 the hypocrisy of this is astounding a do as i say not as i do approach to leadership
35750 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense

35766 cadel is a focussed athlete and he doesnt take much interest in rumours
35767 the australian took second place in the tour de france for the second year running after surprisingly failing to overhaul carlos sastre of spain in saturdays decisive individual time trial
35768 it sounds a little odd to me i didnt know that because cadel started the tour as top favourite he was obliged to win
35769 i would live to see mr whittle in the same situation cadel was nervous but ive seen him more nervous while preparing the suitcase before leaving to the tour
35770 cadel has been unlucky because while those things happened he was surrounded only by cameras and of course the media have chosen the best bits to show everyone
35771 im sure that he did that because those same people were not respecting him at that moment especially when his left side was sore and weeping from the fall this might not be justification to all the children watching but it seems to me that the people looking on the internet for the head butts video were the parents not the children
35772 my understanding is that what happened was completely accidental and that alcohol was not a factor
35773 theres having a couple of wines to celebrate finishing second in the tour de france and theres binge drinking
35774 with or without alcohol if you slip on a wet floor in the way cadel described it to me you are going to do some damage

35785 my family is a mess right now my 9 year old son who saw the shooting still has nightmares and has needed therapy theyve ruined a life and i dont understand why they would get rewarded for that
35786 weve never not recognized an officer shot in the line of duty
35787 i can understand mouas feelings but the officers didnt make any mistakes and they were able to stop things from getting worse
35788 like the old maxim says you dont punish your officers for the mistake of the general
35789 as soon as they started taking fire officers got in front of the kids and used their body as a shield
35790 they used great restraint and shot precisely at where the bullets were coming back from
35791 they never identified themselves we thought they were a whole bunch of drunk crazy guys
35792 we didnt know anything until my oldest son yelled dad its the police
35793 they stepped on my husband and we kept asking where are the bad guys
35794 we were just trying to protect ours kids we almost died that night
35795 they fired 22 rounds with 9 millimeter automatic weapons into a room with two adults and four children
35796 thats not protecting kids they were firing at a room they couldnt see into they fired with the intent to kill the person on the other side of the door
35797 to give these men awards for that behavior is nothing more than an attempt to sanitize their conduct
35798 were not passing judgment today on the rest of what happened there but those officers were shot in the line of duty and there isnt an appropriate level of award for that
35799 saya sungguh meluat melihatkan layanan yang diberikan kepada penjenayah perang itu seolah olah kita tidak pernah menentang pendirian beliau apabila bersama sama as memerangi iraq
35800 malaysia memang sebuah negara yang ramah terhadap tetamu asing tetapi bagaimanakah sanggup kita menerima dengan tersenyum seorang tetapi yang telah berdosa kepada kepada sebegitu ramai rakyat iraq saya sungguh tidak faham

35807 the return programme has not been very successful as few afghans have used it and that is of course a result of the situation in afghanistan all such return programmes are completely dependent on developments in the home country
35808 it is just as much about the economic situation as the security situation because people are not only dependent on an absence of conflict they also need to believe that it is possible to get a job that they can regain access to their agricultural land and so on
35809 seemed to exist only on paper had been running for less than a couple of months or had closed down shortly after being established
35810 this issue of humiliation of honour of being able to return home with your head raised high and so on is a cultural phenomenon which it is particularly important to be aware of as part of the returns process
35811 the families of the afghans that come to norway may have used large portions of their savings on sending them here in the hope that for instance the only son in the family will establish himself here and send home money if he cant then its a greatly humiliating defeat this cultural aspect is vital and related to this we also think it is important to ensure that the returns programme is improved so that the afghans have something positive to return to
35812 we actually think that it is quite generous of us to give reintegration support to people that have a duty to leave the country and that have refused to do so over a long period of time that is how we see it and it provides a different basis for considering the issue
35813 these are people who have completed the whole application process in reality they have a duty to leave norway by their own volition however in recognition of the fact that they are returning to a country with difficulties even though we only return people to areas that we consider safe we are giving them support to enable them to re establish themselves in their home country
35814 for me the reports findings indicate that the programme has functioned reasonably well as it was the first time that we tried something like this and it has improved the lives of some returnees
35815 afghanistan is not the easiest country to make a return programme for either and im sure you remember the context in which the programme was created with a hunger strike a protest march and with powerful interest groups supporting the afghans our new return programme for northern iraq isnt experiencing any of these problems
35816 as for the cash and reintegration support we were aware that this was insufficient before the release of the report but it was the best we could do at the time again remember that this was our very first such initiative and the lessons learned have led to better integration support and a larger cash payment for our iraq programme
35817 most refugees by far are internally displaced or go to neighbouring countries
35818 when you look at the numbers when you look at the hundreds of thousands of iraqis that have fled to poor countries such as jordan syria and lebanon then it is of course completely lacking in perspective to start panicking when asylum seekers arriving in norway increase from a little under 10 000 a year to a little over 10 000 a year
35819 there was a big hole in his head and we couldnt save his life
35820 after the bulldozers finished their work a military jeep belonging the border police pulled over and one soldier knelt down and aimed his rifle at us and shot at us
35821 then ahmed the boy fell down and blood was pouring out of his head
35822 the past is a foreign country they do things differently there
35823 for many years i have dreamed of being an active participant in the revitalization of nassau and in particular bay street
35824 with the grand opening of the bacardi store i am very excited to lead the charge of the revitalization of the bay street business and tourist districts with such a high end offering with the clout of the bacardi name and its international appeal were confident this store will serve as a gateway to the east end of bay street
35825 with the opening of the bacardi store a truly unique retail destination we create a visitor experience that showcases the rich history heritage and passion of the bacardi spirits portfolio for both visitors and those who call nassau home
35826 to commemorate the grand opening of the bacardi store we are pleased to announce the international launch of bacardi reserva limitada this limited edition product is blended from our rarest rums that have been aged in small mature oak barrels for 10 to 16 years nassau is the first place this rum will be sold outside of puerto rico where it is produced
35827 nassau and bay street have something very special as this themed retail outlet is the only branded retail outlet in the world designed solely for the sale of bacardi products and accessories
35828 the fact that a company of the reputation of bacardi would establish a retail store of this quality in nassau speaks volumes of their faith in the destination as a premier tourist attraction with the ability to produce solid business we value our partnership with bacardi and bristol and for our part we are pulling out all the stops to revitalize our product to provide a high quality visitor experience overall
35829 we are working keenly towards the redevelopment of bay street to reestablish its reputation as one of the premier tourist shopping destinations of the world clearly a facility like the bacardi store will contribute much to cementing that image and providing real value for visitors to nassau the bacardi brand is known and respected worldwide

35833 the suncorp announcement this morning is having an impact across the financial sector further dampening confidence
35834 uncertainty continues to linger particularly over the financial and industrial sectors
35835 33 5 of in house counsel reported that law firm services are a commodity
35836 in house counsel reported that 33 5 of law firm services are a commodity
35837 oh now that would have been nice 10 minutes ago
35838 the impact for us obviously is we cant sail out or into the harbour while that ship is there
35839 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
35840 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
35841 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
35842 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy
35843 its terrible the way poles come over fully clothed and stare
35844 if youre an exhibitionist go down to english bay and have your rocks off there
35845 it doesnt belong on the beach which is a family beach and a beach at risk from politicians just because were nude we dont need to add lewd acts
35846 they feel theyve got people coming into their back yards i dont know what the answer is and i dont worry about it i dont have the energy for it im an open free spirited person and i enjoy life and im going to spend my time at a nude beach and if something happens great
35847 people partying for free is totally against capitalism and how the world works
35848 its prime real estate so i dont think itll be there forever i just get the feeling theyre going to slowly snuff us out
35849 im aghast when i go back and look at the records of how many months and years of my life ive spent along with some really wonderful people staying one step ahead of ubc
35850 the greatest threat to the beach is the development boom and the appetite for market housing at ubc and the rainwater runoff problems that this is going to increase manifold
35851 in all the records i searched i never came across anyone who wanted to get rid of it because its a nude beach
35852 but when you get enough people in university town ubcs planned
35853 the people who are moving into university town are let me go out on a limb here not the type to go to wreck beach theres leftover hippies at the beach pot smoking students those who have just paid 2 5 million for a condo will want something a little more manicured i want to go for a walk down trail 7 with my kid without seeing men having sex in the bushes thats a compelling moral argument
35854 citizenship is bought through property ownership when youre at the beach youre not consuming you dont own the property and youre not producing
35855 this was a way to overturn imperialism the patriarchy capitalism all kinds of oppressions and it was the sexual revolution
35856 we try to teach each generation coming to appreciate what weve done to improve it and to make it their own but frankly were a little disappointed like most parents in their children that they havent fully taken up our ideals
35857 the second generation comes and rebels a bit but by and large fall under the first the third generation under 30s realize the first generation are really old and no longer with it the third generation will not understand the mumbo jumbo of judy williamss generation
35858 the first time you see someone with their junk out youre like woah
35859 you just get over yourself i feel like its definitely anti the majority of society wreck symbolizes somewhere you can go and just be your essence because theres nothing attached to you thats the nudist concept theres no bullshit surrounding you youre just being enveloped in the experience
35860 thats the nature of the beast will it smiths generation step up yes will it satisfy judys williams generation no but its a piquant disappointment
35861 feeling where people can take off their clothes and be free
35862 the beach is home to wildly competing groups of users who all seem to make it work
35863 and its a blueprint for what the rest of our city could be most peoples knee jerk reaction is that the beach represents freedom i think it represents possibility
35864 weve seen a run of softer data and we also started seeing the reserve bank make noises about the fact they were happy with the current policy settings
35865 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
35866 we still think petrol prices have been the biggest issue weakening retail trade
35867 the terms of trade remains the biggest factor against a rate cut in the near term
35868 the extent of problems in the credit market are going to cause issues for businesses and households to obtain credit and thats going to help ease domestic expenditure
35869 whether i support government funding for them or not i dont know
35870 to reach people no one else is reaching we must do things no one else is doing
35871 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
35872 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
35873 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
35874 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
35875 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
35876 if it were an official category in the guinness book of world records id hold the title for the most diets attempted in a lifetime
35877 i could not fit in a regular size bathroom stall i had to use the handicapped one if i flew anywhere i had to buy two tickets and dehydrate myself so that i would not have to use the planes bathroom during the flight and just forget the whole seatbelt issue if i went to the movies or a concert i had to bring my own extra sturdy folding chair and sit in handicapped areas
35878 by the time i had enough of my misery and was contemplating surgery as an option i was 27 and already had type 2 diabetes depression suicidal thoughts acute joint pain chronic fatigue severe back pain difficulty walking labored breathing edema and very poor mobility i moved as little as possible and only on an as needed basis on a good day i felt the physical age of 90
35879 when i decided that surgery was the way to go my next step was finding someone who specialized in not just surgical options and procedures but who truly understood obesity that meant understanding its very nature from its origin its progression and its effects physically and emotionally
35880 i didnt want just any doctor who could and would perform the surgery
35881 i remember closing my eyes on the or table and saying to myself i cant wait to start my life
35882 i was very aware of all the risks but what i had already endured physically and emotionally through struggling with my obesity was far worse than any of the possible risks that dr bessler and his staff explained
35883 but after surgery everything was different the most obvious difference was my diet it was so regimented specific and strict i was alternating a half ounce of food or liquid every 30 minutes whether i was hungry or not only specific foods were allowed and had to be pulverized to death in a blender for the first two weeks then for the next two weeks you can add to these foods but they still have to be put through a blender to baby food consistency all i wanted was a stupid cracker
35884 the physical pain after surgery wasnt bad but there were a lot of lifestyle adjustments i maintained regular weekly sessions with my therapist and managed to learn how to exist without using food
35885 my focus is on maintenance not in torturing myself or keeping myself in a perpetual state of unhappiness until i reach what may be an unrealistic and unattainable goal
35886 character is always lost when a high ideal is where can i get a list of all the presidential candidates and their bios

35896 theres a quote from the recent i 35w bridge investigative report that reads when a bridge collapses so does public faith in government
35897 unfortunately it seems no one in our government is bothered by the fact that the public no longer trusts our so called leaders to keep us safe
35898 bureaucrats and politicians were ignoring our infrastructure problems before the collapse and a year later theyre continuing to ignore them meanwhile americans continue to drive across thousands of bridges that are not only in need of serious repair but that were never designed for the amount of traffic we inflict on them now in the first place
35899 clearly government at all levels is falling down on the job weve hired them to perform
35900 the problems associated with the nations infrastructure were easy to ignore until the i 35w bridge collapse at that point we saw what can happen when unsafe infrastructure stays in use without the necessary repairs but our politicians are masters at avoiding these problems for example the latest reports from minnesota clearly show that as early as 1999 photographs depicting bowed or warped gusset plates were warning signs of impending disaster nearly ten years before the collapse and when the levees broke in the midwest responsibility was passed between government entities but no one not the army corps of engineers not fema not state officials wanted to take responsibility
35901 for decades reams of engineering analysis and reports have highlighted the deteriorating nature of our infrastructure and the costs of remediation costs that increase exponentially as every year passes
35902 its time for our nations politicians to be honest with the public about just how bad the infrastructure situation is
35903 that means acknowledging that many of our state roads and bridges are in desperate shape state officials at every level must stop ignoring the damning aspects of reports they receive that show the need for repairs
35904 today there are no uniform state mandated minimum standards for the maintenance of bridges and roads
35905 inspections of bridges are to occur every two years by federal requirements but when carried out these are often subjective visual observations that fail to use the latest technology to detect cracks and corrosion that may be invisible the federal government provides 2 billion in maintenance costs annually for 600 000 bridges that fall within its purview this works out to a paltry 3 500 per bridge far too little to cover an adequate bridge inspection the long and short of it is that in addition to more funding the inspection process itself needs to be examined and brought up to 21st century standards in order to get our infrastructure system back on track
35906 i understand the desire to cut costs but government officials should consider the increased costs that will occur if an infrastructure disaster happens on their watch
35907 a recentreport from the american council of engineering companies shows that california alone estimates that it is losing 15 billion or more a year in loss of production due to the lack of necessary spending to repair the states infrastructure state governments should take into account how much they are losing by avoiding these repairs money is being lost whether there is a disaster or not the only thing that differs is how muchmoney is lost politicians and officials should take this into consideration when they make short term budget cuts that make infrastructure repairs even more difficult
35908 tasked with evaluating and financing capacity building infrastructure projects of substantial regional and national significance infrastructure projects that come under the banks consideration are publicly owned mass transit systems housing properties roads bridges drinking water systems and wastewater systems
35909 unfortunately the infrastructure bank act hasnt gotten far in congress but it does serve as a tiny step in the right direction
35910 of course funding the bank will be a big challenge state and federal budgets are stretched thin one option might be the issuance of bonds similar to the mechanism used by the new york amp new jersey triborough bridge and tunnel authority to construct the bridges and tunnels connecting those states a second method may be encouraging public private partnerships which would invite equity funds with deep pockets to fund infrastructure repairs in return for tolls
35911 until a national infrastructure bank can be established members of congress must ensure that all gas tax money goes toward the repair and maintenance of our nations roadways
35912 the same goes for tolls that are currently being collected on roadways throughout the country while this gas tax money is just a drop in the barrel compared to what it will take to get our nations infrastructure back on track making sure its actually used for its intended purpose will at least buy us a little time
35913 as a result the powers that be who are basically politicians constantly vying for re election prefer to spend that money on more glamorous things that get noticed by the public
35914 simply put they get far more political mileage from beautifying an old park than from making repairs on a bridge or roadway we need national standards for our bridges and roadways we cant have highway systems that are maintained under 50 different sets of standards it just isnt working
35915 mndot initially recognized the need for redundancy but later focused on the fatigue analysis ultimately the bridge did not receive any materially different treatment than it had historically and redundancy was not added to the bridge
35916 it turns out that bent gusset plates were photographed and filed away in 1999 but none of the inspectors or mndot officials who looked at the photo noticed
35917 the bending of multiple plates is what may eventually be deemed a contributing cause of the collapse if the repairs and inspections above had been carried out as planned perhaps the bent gusset plates would have been noticed and the bridge could have been closed to protect the public fixing infrastructure problems that could lead to loss of human life is compulsory not optional we should create an independent system that requires that monies are used as designated and which then ensures that projects get completed as planned it should not be earmarked money or pork barrel spending but a non discretionary spending item that must go toward its intended purpose
35918 big dig payments have already sucked maintenance and repair money away from deteriorating roads and bridges across the state forcing the state to float more highway bonds and to go even deeper into the hole massachusetts spends a higher percentage of its highway budget on debt than any other state
35919 establishing fixed priced contracts on large infrastructure remediation projects will lead to savings of billions of public dollars
35920 when you consider the huge numbers of projects that must be completed in order to restore americas infrastructure its clear that american taxpayers cant afford a business as usual mindset anymore
35921 we must look at our infrastructure problem as a puzzle that can be solved
35922 we have all of the pieces in our hands we have countless reports telling us how dire the situation is we know the costs related to making and not making the repairs and we have seen what happens when infrastructure fails now is the time to start putting the puzzle together the publics safety is at risk on a day to day basis its time for our government to do what its being paid to do and take aggressive action to protect its people
35923 that girl i said hello to was my friend just because we are dating does not mean i am going to neglect my friends male or female they mean a lot to me too id appreciate it if you trusted me as i have no intention on cheating on you

35925 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
35926 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
35927 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
35928 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
35929 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
35930 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
35931 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
35932 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
35933 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
35934 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
35935 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
35936 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
35937 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
35938 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
35939 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
35940 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
35941 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
35942 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
35943 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
35944 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
35945 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
35946 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
35947 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
35948 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
35949 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
35950 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
35951 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
35952 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
35953 look at these people dont they have anything better to do but relive their youth by listening to some over the hill rock band
35954 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
35955 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
35956 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
35957 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
35958 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
35959 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
35960 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
35961 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
35962 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
35963 ha ido acumulando una serie de agravios en contra de los directivos y de la comunidad estudiantil brise o torres emitir esta noche un mensaje a la comunidad estudiantil
35964 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
35965 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
35966 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
35967 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
35968 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
35969 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
35970 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
35971 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
35972 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
35973 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
35974 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
35975 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
35976 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

35979 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
35980 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
35981 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
35982 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
35983 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
35984 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
35985 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
35986 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

35988 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
35989 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
35990 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
35991 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
35992 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
35993 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
35994 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients

35998 in order to comply with the flsa the state during a budget impasse must timely pay nonexempt employees who do not work overtime at least at the minimum wage rate
35999 in any event as already noted the controllers claim of infeasibility was not fully litigated below and thus we do not believe it would be appropriate to attempt to definitively resolve the claim at this juncture

36001 the president knows as his own administration has stated that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
36002 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
36003 today the new direction congress will vote on legislation to bring down gas prices by taking crucial steps to curb excessive speculation in the energy futures market the president himself could lower prices by drawing down a small portion of our government oil stockpile the strategic petroleum reserve the new direction congress will continue to bring forth responsible proposals to increase supply reduce prices protect consumers and transition america to a clean renewable energy independent future

36027 this means all 40kmh school zones will be in force across the whole state
36028 school zones are now in force to ensure the safety all students who may be travelling to or from school even on pupil free days
36029 while department of education schools have fixed pupil free days these schools are still obliged to accept students who arrive to attend school
36030 non government schools have the option to determine what days are programed as pupil free meaning where one school in a zone might be closed another might be operational
36031 drivers may not know if the school they are driving past is having a pupil free day or if students are at school thats why all 40kmh school zones are in force
36032 not applying the 40kmh school zone speed limit on gazetted school days would pose a clear and unacceptable risk to children who can still be around schools on these days
36033 childrens safety to and from school is an important road safety issue kids are vulnerable because of their small size and lack of experience
36034 drivers are less likely to be able to see a small child and it is harder for children to see oncoming traffic
36035 their lack of road experience means it is difficult for children to judge dangerous situations which is why 40kmh school zones are in place
36036 the majority of school zones operate between 8 9 30am and 2 30pm 4pm on gazetted school days
36037 there are a small number of non standard school zone times in new south wales
36038 these zones are identified by red orange school zone signs which indicate non standard times

36254 well sometimes youve got to get lucky and turn on a few and then the key for me is using the whole field
36255 if theyre throwing it away just keep hitting it to left if they start coming in turn on it and make it tough on where theyre going to pitch you
36256 it was a little different this year going in a little more relaxed and just have fun with it

36262 the evolution from the college game to the pro game of being aware of whats going on around you ratchets up even again

36271 no ser a una sorpresa para m que se fuera porque cuando se habla de estas cosas es que hay algo
36272 en el equipo trabajamos igual que si luis fuera a quedarse toda la temporada
36273 luis es un jugador con una gran mentalidad que aporta cosas positivas
36274 cuanto m s tarde haya una soluci n peor luis es un gran futbolista est comprometido con el grupo y ser a una gran baja para nosotros
36275 no nos hemos planteado un sustituto cuando se tenga que marchar decidiremos
36276 continuaremos presionando y trabajando con las autoridades chinas para enterarnos qu est pasando y veremos qu podemos hacer
36277 por qu p ginas como la de la bbc en mandar n y amnist a internacional est n censuradas
36278 los controles del gobierno chino en internet son contrarios a las promesas del cio de que la prensa podr a trabajar con las mismas facilidades que en los juegos anteriores
36279 miles de periodistas que visiten pek n experimentar n ahora la censura que los reporteros e internautas en china tienen que soportar a diario
36280 el acceso a unas pocas p ginas web es dif cil porque propagan contenido prohibido por la ley china que regula internet
36281 determinada a cumplir las regulaciones y a tratar de hacerlo de forma efectiva
36282 si yo mismo y los medios internacionales hubi ramos sido informados antes de que algunas p ginas ser an inaccesibles no nos encontrar amos ahora en la posici n en la que nos encontramos por sorpresa
36283 ni siquiera estaba segura de poder participar en el torneo en las ltimas semanas he intentado encontrar una soluci n a este problema pero hasta ahora no la he encontrado

36287 tanto bolt como powell van a estar muy cerca el uno del otro por lo que el ganador va a tener que correr mucho para no verse superado por su rival el vencedor puede estar pr ximo a los 9 70 y por tanto podr a rebajar los 9 72 que tiene bolt como r cord mundial
36288 vencer en 200 metros ser una mera formalidad para bolt
36289 pero la mayor a estar limpia y de lo que hay que preocuparse es de la mayor a
36290 no creo que se convierta en la prueba estrella como sucedi en anteriores juegos ol mpicos puesto que falta competitividad y un mayor n mero de aspirantes a la victoria tal y como suced a en mi poca cuando est bamos carl lewis dennis mitchell frankie fredericks y yo mismo
36291 en china la es respetada y garantizada en hoteles y otros lugares las acusaciones son injustas

36299 el pasado mi rcoles recibimos un correo de la iaaf que nos anunciaba la suspensi n provisional de estas seis atletas
36300 lamentablemente en vista de esta decisi n de la iaaf estas atletas no podr n participar en los juegos de pek n
36301 estados unidos y espa a son los m ximos favoritos para pek n
36302 nuestras opciones est n ah con deportistas consolidados en lo m s alto del r nking y que generan por ello una gran expectaci n
36303 estos cuatro a os han sido de lo mejor de espa a en resultados deportivos lo que invita al optimismo espero que lo hagamos muy bien y consigamos el mayor n mero de medallas posible pero no creo que nadie vaya a ganar por sorpresa
36304 la contaminaci n disminuir durante los juegos conseguir n unos jj oo verdes tal y como prometieron
36305 sales continue to exceed supply and we continue to receive weekly incoming shipments from apple thanks to pre ordered inventory
36306 we also continue to appreciate our customers enthusiasm for the device and patience when inventory sells out in specific stores
36307 i think its something thats common to both canada and the u s right now
36308 its a very popular device and it looks like apple and their carrier partners might have underestimated the number they would sell which is quite surprising to me considering that they expected they would sell a lot anyway
36309 i wouldnt be surprised if it was apple are of course the masters of hype and this does help keep the hype going but at the same time you have to wonder at a certain limit are people going to keep putting up with shortages or are they just going to buy something else beyond a certain limit the phones have to become available or people will just buy something else
36310 if you look at the iphone the instinct and the dare you would definitely think they were cousins if not siblings
36311 however as it is anticipated that iphone subscribers will generally subscribe to both voice and data service plans the average revenue per unit arpu per iphone 3g subscriber is also expected to be higher than wireless average postpaid arpu that is generated from the majority of its other devices
36312 we estimate rci rogers can add 200 000 plus iphone subscriptions in 08 given the 150 million commitment to apple
36313 if people start buying these applications en masse thats going to turn all of the other mobile guys including the carriers to say what is this why arent people buying applications on our phones what is it that we are doing wrong i think thats going to happen
36314 its disconcerting given that almost every early indicator we had was pointing to modest growth and to basically have every missing piece of the puzzle wind up on the down side is unnerving it does suggest there is some very real underlying weakness here in the economy
36315 the softness thus far has been so highly concentrated in one sector net trade that it has failed to infiltrate ontarios core domestic economy
36316 while this result was surprising given the data released earlier in the month it supports our view that economic activity in canada in the second half of this year will be very sluggish
36317 me ha hecho mucha ilusi n entrar en esta convocatoria porque va a ser un partido muy especial para todos
36318 debo seguir trabajando y esforz ndome pero espero disfrutar de esta experiencia no s si volver muchas veces a old trafford
36319 in my estimation and many people in hockey feel the same way steves the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level that wasnt a gm
36320 we realize there are more and more demands in this business at this level in order to get the job done you need many people doing it ill still be involved in the hockey operations side
36321 i met daryl katz and listening to his plans for this hockey club moving forward big things are coming here
36322 for me watching people in that leadership role with no ego bob nicholson wayne gretzky kevin lowe pat quinn and his coaching staff was so impressive
36323 i knew right away i could get to another level working with those people
36324 this is an opportunity that steve could not pass up and we are in full support of his decision to advance his career
36325 quite frankly when we worked together with team canada i never envisioned this happening
36326 but hockey is an interesting business my favourite motto is expect the unexpected and the unexpected happened in the last four to six days
36327 i do know theres a tremendous amount of potential from our young players this is an exciting team
36328 jorge mendes ha retomado en las ltimas horas los contactos con nosotros para insistir en la premisa de cristiano ronaldo quiere abandonar el club para recalar en el real madrid
36329 no hay ninguna novedad m s porque tanto sir alex ferguson como david gill se mantienen bien pertrechados en su posici n y no tienen el m s m nimo inter s en vender al futbolista
36330 cristiano ronaldo y ferguson se ver n las caras el pr ximo lunes en manchester cuando el jugador se reincorpore a la disciplina del equipo para aclarar de una vez por todas la situaci n pero la postura del club es inamovible
36331 william es un gran capit n le respeto mucho por su experiencia pero pienso que aunque yo s lo tengo 21 a os estoy capacitado tambi n para ese honor
36332 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
36333 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
36334 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
36335 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
36336 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
36337 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
36338 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
36339 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
36340 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
36341 si queremos algo y lo conseguimos en una semana bien si tardamos un mes no hay problema nada de eso interfiere en las negociaciones
36342 nos da lo mismo el mismo miedo tenemos de enfrentarnos a un rival como el rival lo tendr de nosotros
36343 para nosotros no ser un problema si el sorteo termina as lo importante es estar ah y jugar la ilusi n es nuestro motor
36344 estar nervioso porque el atl tico es un equipo fuerte
36345 tenemos claro que nos tocar un rival fuerte y tendremos que estar al m ximo los dos partidos perder no ser a un fracaso pero s un golpe muy duro
36346 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh

36352 en renault hace dos a os que pararon de trabajar en el desarrollo del motor inlcuso hay menos personal en la f brica de viry es curioso porque renault siempre hab a tenido un buen motor y era su punto fuerte respecto a otros equipos y desde hace dos temporadas no se han ganado caballos de potencia mientras que otros equipos s lo han hecho yo estuve en otra escuder a el a o pasado y vi como mejoraron el motor durante la temporada
36353 otros tomaron diferente camino y est n muy por delante de nosotros
36354 sigo disfrutando con la f rmula 1 y tengo contrato con ferrari para el a o que viene nunca dije que fuera a retirarme
36355 reagrupar las cantidades que recibe la liga del 10 por ciento de las quinielas para que ese dinero pueda ser empleado como garant a de pago a los futbolistas
36356 reconducir el camino para mejorar el f tbol profesional espa ol ya que estamos ante una de las mejores ligas del mundo
36357 este a o soy mucho m s feliz sin duda aunque no tenga la posibilidad de luchar por el campeonato
36358 no recuerdo ni una carrera en la que kovalainen haya ido con menos gasolina que hamilton en hockenheim se apart para que pasara hamilton a m me tocar a estar haciendo ese papel ahora
36359 al final de cada a o necesitas estudiar las mejores posibilidades pero a mitad de agosto no es tiempo de pensar en eso hasta septiembre u octubre no decidir nada
36360 frustrado al ver que haces una carrera perfecta y no consigas nada y de que nuestro objetivo sea acabar a partir de la sexta posici n esto no es lo que ha sucedido en los ltimos a os cuando marcaba poles y sub a al podio pero esto es parte del juego no siempre ganan los mismos ni en el tour ni en el mundial
36361 s lo tengo 27 a os y queda mucho camino por recorrer s lo hace falta ver a michael schumacher estuvo cuatro a os en ferrari sin ganar un s lo t tulo yo estoy contento en renault y con el apoyo del equipo la gente trabaja ma ana y noche para darme el mejor coche para que un d a pase del s ptimo al quinto y quiz a un podio
36362 el objetivo es el mismo que en todas las otras carreras acabar cerca de la sexta posici n
36363 estuve all tres d as porque jarno trulli con quien coincidi en renault siempre me hab a dicho que era una zona muy bonita es cierto que estuve all pero buscando hotel para una noche y no casa para mudarme
36364 no me vuelvas a joder as en tu puta vida
36365 estoy muy contento de haber renovado ten a varias opciones pero mi idea siempre ha sido la de quedarme aqu era muy importante para m y para mi familia
36366 desde que llegu no hemos ganado muchos t tulos pero espero que a partir de ahora volvamos a ser el equipo ganador que siempre ha sido el bar a estoy muy ilusionado con el proyecto y conf o mucho en el nuevo ciclo

36368 ha admitido la petici n presentada ayer por la fiscal a tras la comunicaci n de la agencia francesa antidopaje del positivo de dicho ciclista durante el tour
36369 hes a heavy drinker and sometimes when he drinks he changes and gets real nasty
36370 he was crouched down ready to pounce on me and he was scaring me he jumped up and grabbed me by my face and grabbed my nose and bit it off
36371 i dont know if he swallowed it or if my dogs might have eaten it i dont know
36372 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
36373 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
36374 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
36375 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
36376 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
36377 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
36378 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
36379 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
36380 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
36381 youve got the no 9 hitter and youve got grady sizemore on deck and you throw a 3 2 breaking ball that is not acceptable
36382 on a 3 2 count in that situation you know the guy is looking for a fastball i should have gone ahead and thrown it thats the way i normally pitch here it is hit it
36383 the pitch i was more upset about was the pitch when i hit fasano i had two strikes on him it kind of went downhill from there
36384 you cant get too upset at yourself for stuff like that
36385 but the stuff leading up to it is what you get upset about the hit batter and the walk
36386 if grady comes up and does that with nobody on its not that big of a deal
36387 i feel like i let one slip away a little bit
36388 i feel like i had some pretty good stuff my command wasnt as good as i would have liked but i had plenty of situations where if i make some pitches i can get myself out of some jams or not even create the jams that i got into
36389 it is not a fare hike it is a fuel surcharge we did not implement this we are actually matching competitors
36390 but its kind of a hike to get to it and there is no supervision there
36391 this was a very large gator and as they get bigger they can become more aggressive
36392 its too bad someone didnt contact us to get it out of there
36393 it was all together but it was a blueish color
36394 the urgent problem with reattaching a limb is getting blood supply to the muscle as soon as possible
36395 it is very heroic surgery and the risks are very high
36396 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
36397 i got calls telling me i was a piece of crap
36398 i got text messages telling me i hope you blow out your knee
36399 you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment
36400 this will give us an opportunity to have companies stay in the state
36401 ive been begging them since i got here to run the ball more
36402 when people know we can run the ball they are going to have to stop focusing on only stopping me and calvin
36403 this is going to open a lot of things up for roy and me
36404 when we start running the ball people have to put more people into the box that means we get one on one coverage on the outside and thats when good things start to happen
36405 people have to understand that he was only playing at 60 or 70 percent last year
36406 things have slowed down for me a lot this year
36407 the new offense helps but mainly it is just from having done all of this before that makes a huge difference
36408 if we run the ball the way we should and we dont get behind by 21 points this system should present more opportunities for roy and calvin
36409 we just cant get ourselves into predictable passing situations because thats when teams can take things away from us
36410 we might run the ball more this year but that doesnt change where our stars are
36411 you dont capture every single customer what about all of those customers paying with cash customers you cannot track
36412 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
36413 if you are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
36414 the clear intention behind this move is to chill the cubicles by suppressing any uncontrolled information
36415 the population is growing at the fastest rate in 18 years buoyed by record migration but building of homes and apartments hasnt kept up federal and state governments still seem to be working on the view that the market will eventually adjust but there are few signs of that occurring
36416 we have recommended him to others who are also impressed
36417 that resulted in the ship swinging to starboard on exiting the port and running aground at beacon 44
36418 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
36419 the deal may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc
36420 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
36421 we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed
36422 in a multi storey environment for example its difficult to have base stations around the area so we need to form an ad hoc network
36423 the purpose is to rapidly and accurate identify areas of contamination and see how to rectify the situation
36424 unless they want to go around carrying these devices thats not the best use of the technology
36425 they michigan state are doing a lot of growing they are putting a lot of money into the program and making some major renovations so the dedication is there
36426 despite this statement no hamas prisoner has been released until this evening by the
36427 i can tell you we have nothing to do with it
36428 if you look at it that little bug on the shoulder area is actually a fly and that gives you an idea of what size it is
36429 he said the jaw was broken and thats why it looks like a beak with long fingers its more like a raccoon
36430 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
36431 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
36432 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
36433 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
36434 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
36435 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
36436 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
36437 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
36438 in his ruling u s district judge john bates said theres no legal basis for bushs argument and that his former legal counsel harriet miers must appear before congress
36439 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
36440 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
36441 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
36442 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
36443 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
36444 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
36445 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
36446 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
36447 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
36448 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices
36449 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
36450 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
36451 i thought that would be something they wouldnt do or try to stay away from as far as here i like the guys we have behind center right now in kyle and rex and i think those guys can definitely take us through
36452 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a
36453 we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism
36454 we over cover rather than under cover its better to go ahead than to pull back we throw everything out the window in order to provide the best coverage
36455 lots of people told us julie belongs on a station for music lovers like the sound including some guy named howard stern
36456 he is an itt specialist on the uss blue ridge
36457 he squired me around like royalty with trips on the bullet train to kyoto hiroshima and tokyo and road trips to mt fuji and yokohama
36458 while i was in tokyo there was an earthquake with a 6 8 magnitude after our 5 4 quake here thats 12 2 on the richter scale for me in less than one week
36459 yes i would be willing to wear a portable people meter i would love to have my radio station choices tabulated
36460 some say the path we take is guided by fate or unseen forces
36461 he didnt seem to be an axe murderer or anything
36462 little did i know that it would change my life
36463 every once in a while you ask yourself what am i doing
36464 you cant just walk away its in your blood its what you know its what you are no matter how hard you try you het sucked right back in youre in for life and sometimes that feels like an eternity

36472 how come i dont already have a plethora of knowledge on this useless subject
36473 a vacation is not an adventure it is a reprieve from reality true adventure takes daring and a willing embrace of all that is unknown
36474 just because youve been exploring my mouth doesnt mean you get to take an expedition further south
36475 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
36476 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
36477 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
36478 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
36479 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
36480 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
36481 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
36482 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
36483 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
36484 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
36485 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
36486 we must also be prepared to act quickly to secure those weapons and materials in cases where a state loses control of its weapons especially nuclear devices
36487 did google maps really bring us to the right spot
36488 id be shocked beyond belief and id get a gun out and shoot him if he doesnt make what he promised now

36573 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
36574 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
36575 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play

36579 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
36580 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested

36603 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the product of oceanic respiration due to the well known but under appreciated solubility pump carbon dioxide rises out of warm ocean waters where it is added to the atmosphere there it is mixed with residual and accidental co2 and circulated to be absorbed into the sink of the cold ocean waters next the thermohaline circulation carries the co2 rich sea water deep into the ocean a millennium later it appears at the surface in warm waters saturated by lower pressure and higher temperature to be exhausted back into the atmosphere throughout the past 420 millennia comprising four interglacial periods the vostok record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is imprinted with and fully characterized by the physics of the solubility of co2 in water along with the lag in the deep ocean circulation notwithstanding that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas atmospheric carbon dioxide has neither caused nor amplified global temperature increases increased carbon dioxide has been an effect of global warming not a cause technically carbon dioxide is a lagging proxy for ocean temperatures when global temperature and along with it ocean temperature rises the physics of solubility causes atmospheric co2 to increase if increases in carbon dioxide or any other greenhouse gas could have in turn raised global temperatures the positive feedback would have been catastrophic while the conditions for such a catastrophe were present in the vostok record from natural causes the runaway event did not occur carbon dioxide does not accumulate in the atmosphere

36605 but that ad diminishes him and makes him look silly
36606 we had made absolutely no arrangements to transport the press to the hospital
36607 thats completely untrue and i think honestly they know its untrue
36608 we had scheduled to go we had no problem at all in leaving press we always leave press and staff out thats why we left it off the schedule
36609 i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisers a former military officer and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff
36610 that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns so rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been seen as a political controversy of some sort what we decided was that we would not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops who were there so thats essentially the extent of the story
36611 the grossest calumny in the continuing anti serb bias in the british press is the myth that it was the serbs who were nationalists in fact they and many croats bosnians and kosovans were the multi ethnic federalists seeking to preserve yugoslavia and the extreme nationalists were those who now govern the statelets of croatia muslim bosnia and albanian kosovo the eu supported and funded that nationalism which they condemn within the eu but which they exploit in order to undermine nation states outside the eu germanys interest in destroying both yugoslavia and czechoslovakia was to reverse the results of the first world war which established those states
36612 the spirit of the media frenzy surrounding the arrest of the former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic on july 21 is based entirely on the doctrine of non equivalence inaugurated in 1992 serbs willed the war muslims wanted peace serb crimes are bad and justly exaggerated muslim crimes are understandable
36613 washingtons motives were not rooted in the concern for the muslims of bosnia as such or indeed any higher moral principle
36614 their policy had no basis in the law of nations or in the notions of truth or justice it was the end result of the interaction of pressure groups within the american power structure
36615 a virulently anti serb agenda driven form of realpolitik that was to dominate americas bosnian policy
36616 the truth is that there was no internal bosnian threat to peace at the beginning of 1991 yet once reunited germany was committed to the recognition of croatia and slovenia the muslim leadership in sarajevo knew both that the old yugoslavia was dead and that historic opportunities beckoned
36617 an eyewitness to the subsequent violence and breakup of the country i also was a witness to the historical amnesia suffered by the political leaders of france britain the united states and my own country canada these countries were serbias old traditional allies in two world wars yet they shamefully stood by and joined in the betrayal of yugoslavia
36618 the break up of yugoslavia was a disaster for the serbian people thousands killed and many more thousands forced to flee their ancestral homelands yet the greatest tragedy of all is that the serbs have been blamed for everything that has happened since the breakup they have been blamed for the breakup itself they have been blamed for starting the violence they have been blamed for the ethnic cleansing that occurred they have been blamed for the massacres they have been blamed for genocide finally they have been blamed for the nato bombing of their own country
36619 these are lies lies lies hitlers propaganda minister joseph goebbels said if you tell a monstrous lie people will believe you because they cannot imagine anyone making up such an outrageous falsehood then if evidence is shown to contradict the lie you dismiss it as irrelevant or misguided finally when the truth is disclosed it is too late nobody cares or wants to know
36620 president clinton and tony blair talked about genocide taking place in kosovo the u s secretary of defense william cohen said there were over a hundred thousand young albanian men missing in kosovo robin cook the british foreign minister and clare short his cabinet colleague both made outrageous charges against the serbs about non existent rape camps later it was reported by the unhcr and even the anti serb george soros financed human rights watch that these stories had no foundation
36621 karadzic personally and the serbs collectively were severely damaged by the western media handling of their mistreatment of muslim prisoners and by their expulsion of non serb civilians in the summer of 1992 similar atrocities by croats and muslims against serbs and against each other while no less common were less conspicuous and deemed unworthy of attention the western elite class chose its sympathies at the start and kept up an agitation in favor of military intervention against the serbs
36622 the judgment against karadzic at the u s sponsored and largely u s funded tribunal at the hague will be built on this flawed foundation it will be neither fair or just and therefore it will be detrimental to what america should stand for in the world it will also give further credence to the myth of muslim blameless victimhood serb viciousness and western indifference and therefore weaken our resolve in the global struggle euphemistically known as war on terrorism the former is a crime the latter a mistake
36623 the strange truth is that great powers pay a fee for entering the balkan casino
36624 the media frenzy surrounding the arrest of the former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic based entirely on the doctrine of non equivalence inaugurated in 1992
36625 karadzics arrest removes from the scene a man who was still undermining peace and progress in the balkans while he dispensed natural remedies at a health clinic in belgrade and whose enthusiastic advocacy of ethnic cleansing merits a special place in history
36626 whose enthusiastic advocacy of ethnic cleansing merits a special place in history
36627 karadzics arrest is no mere historical footnote it also moves serbia closer to european union membership
36628 o man consider carefully that i first loved you you had not yet appeared in the light of day nor did the world yet exist but already i loved you from all eternity i have loved you

36778 it was a wild race in the end but we were able to capitalize and finish in the top 10
36779 im looking forward to going back to the city the people are very nice and we had a great turnout for the race i think it was close to 70 000 people there to watch the napa auto parts 200
36780 my father marcel raced dirt modifieds and was racing in middletown new york some time around 1992 and he wrecked his car during the heat race
36781 we repaired the damage and asked buzzie reutimann who is davids father to race the car because he was guaranteed a starting spot david was there and helped us work on the car after that we sort of stayed in touch and he helped me make contact with jon dysinger at trd south its a great experience to be able to work with davids nationwide team and for me a win in montreal would be incredible
36782 were fourth right now but we have had some bad stuff happen to us that have been out of our control and also of our own doing
36783 weve got to make sure we are not worrying about the points and focus on each race weekend the points will fall into place if we continue to run well finish strong and win races
36784 continuing the dialogue between art and the lives of ordinary people
36785 the track is a very tough tricky technical road course well have a different look on the no 99 toyota this weekend and we are so fortunate to have napa canada on board with us aarons who is also a strong partner of michael waltrip racing like napa will be back with us next week

36794 im glad to be going back to pocono raceway for a second time in a cup car
36795 we learned a lot the last time we were there and i think pocono will be a good race for us
36796 i was not able to have much practice because of the tire problem and that hurt us at indy
36797 we have also had some bad luck before racing at the brickyard we ran into some problems at new hampshire and more recently we were wrecked in the opening laps at chicagoland speedway that put us dead last in the finishing order we took a blow in the points from that deal we have just got to be smooth at pocono and have a solid finish to gain some points
36798 its not fun that we have to qualify but i think we can qualify the 00 champion mortgage toyota fairly easy
36799 weve been fast enough to make races but weve never been in this position before we need to have a good weekend
36800 he did a really good job at the brickyard and helped our weekend run smooth minus the tire deal
36801 i think we both like racing there and have had some success at the track before
36802 the biggest thing is that ive been there before in a cup car were looking to build on that
36803 this was one of the worst races ever it was so disappointing for a multitude of reasons
36804 i got beside another guy and got loose then somebody just ran me over my situation wasnt a track issue just racing the 77 sam hornish jr got wide and i dove under him and then he came down i have to control my car so it wasnt his fault i got sideways and had my car saved i felt pretty good about it then the 15 paul menard just ran me over
36805 i am so proud of the effort my guys gave today
36806 they did one heck of a job to get me back out on the track we needed the points we understand the significance of the points but we also understand the safety aspect of fixing our napa car properly my guys got it done perfectly and im real proud of them
36807 it changes quite a lot you are talking about the hottest six weeks of the whole year between june and august we will head back knowing the track is going to be different a driver that put an end to some of that kind of thinking was denny hamlin he went up there as a rookie and won the first and second race at pocono he probably didnt notice it changing at all i think as we go forward drivers understand what denny was able to accomplish it was impressive we all know that the track changes but it changes for everybody you just go up there and deal with it
36808 i am of the opinion that they should put a patch like that at all the tracks go somewhere and find a groove that you never run and pave it brand new it will mix things up that patch at pocono in turn 3 made it so fun thats because you had the opportunity to dive to the bottom and take the shortest way around and try to beat a guy around a corner who is taking the long way on some fresh asphalt that fresh asphalt had a lot of grip i thought it was fun to be honest with you pocono has always been one of my favorite tracks but this new patch of pavement has made it even more fun because it gives us another groove to race its another option and thats always a good thing to have
36809 we should have been able to say on saturday afternoon that we had a problem
36810 i think in moving forward we need more testing before we go back to indy to avoid this situation from happening again they have to go back there and understand exactly what you need to come back there and race over the 50 plus years of nascar racing very rarely has goodyear ever let the competitors down nor have they let the fans down indy was a big day nascar had goodyears back and they decided to work together to do the best they could to put on an exciting race it was an isolated incident we will all get it better and be smarter next time we will go to pocono this weekend and you are going to see great racing without any tire problems
36811 it was a really frustrating day for not just our team but for everyone out there
36812 we could only really race for around seven to eight laps and then the tires were just gone nascar did the best they could in this situation to keep the race progressing and to keep the drivers safe but i know it wasnt a fun race to watch because it wasnt fun to drive in at all we were in survival mode the whole day so were ready to put this race behind us and head to pocono
36813 you know weve been known each other for three years

37008 well look at it this way in 10 years of so well all laugh at how stupid we were etc
37009 i dont think were getting anywhere i think were repeating ourselves failure upon failure
37010 i think we should try to address the root problem rather than the symptom and the root problem is energy
37011 were really stupid and weve been stupid for a long time
37012 this is a country that has more ingenuity and if what were known for is american ingenuity yankee ingenuity whatever you want to call it what happened to it where is it lets see it its in somebodys garage i like to use the internet to explore the world looking for fringe technologies and its great theyre all out there theyre on youtube all these guys with their ideas scientists men and women around the world universities people in different countries they all have different ideas of how to do things and get to and all kinds of things that would help to change the world i think when we can solve that problem then the need for war will go away

37015 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
37016 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
37017 is using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
37018 that could happen again if people hear obama speak and say he sounds reasonable
37019 john mccain is simply not a relevant variable in this election
37020 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
37021 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
37022 we kind of get lost in the shuffle with the rscva
37023 in fact we are not even advertised on their rscva logos or anything else like that it would take a lot of the weight off of the rscva if we are allowed to do this
37024 i dont know what they city council members are thinking
37025 the city of sparks despite its outcry that the rscva treats them like a stepchild really benefits from the efforts of the rscva
37026 right now sparks doesnt have the name recognition of a reno tahoe
37027 and i will tell you what when people come to reno tahoe they eventually get to sparks
37028 so if i was a sparks citizen which i am id tell them city council members to cool your jets ride the tide and enjoy the profits
37029 you would need another entity to collect taxes another entity to design ads another entity that goes to trade shows with a booth
37030 they henderson officials do have a tourism agency and they do retain a small portion from the room tax collected in their city for use in operating their tourism agency
37031 the remainder goes to the lvcva and i would assume it is a pretty big chunk
37032 especially as it relates to group and meeting business we go out under the umbrella of the rscva and it would be hard to lose that
37033 what they do for us is not as well understood as what they dont do
37034 were on the road with their sales staff a lot they also provide a lot of leads for us in the way of group business as well as leisure sales they are the natural go to for most meeting planners
37035 in the last couple of years sparks has really come into its own with tourism and marketing
37036 we have the legends at sparks marina a 130 acre project that is going to increase room nights and add 600 000 new visitors here on an annual basis in order to give it proper service and proper marketing for the city of sparks it would be best for us to go ahead and handle that internally in the city
37037 i dont know if we have created a tourist destination yet
37038 we are close but we are not there yet but the council wants to do this so we will see where it goes
37039 if we can get their rscva officials attention and they start including us more in the process then it is a win win situation
37040 if this is an indication that sparks is interested in playing a more active role in promoting tourism to the region thats terrific

37209 part of the reason that im stopping in south korea prior to going to the olympics i mean one could have attempted just to go straight to the olympics but i want to come to south korea i had just come from japan and its all part of making sure that our foreign policy is active
37210 theres plenty of room for countries to work with the three countries you mentioned with other countries in the region in a constructive way in other words i dont view the diplomacy as zero sum its got to be either this country or that country
37211 asean is a place where the united states can remain should remain actively engaged with nations who are saying say wait a minute were your friends as well dont just focus on the big guys think about us
37212 its very important for the president to be very consistent
37213 the fact that both countries the us and china are honoring the 30th anniversary of the relationship shows that its a statement about good relations if we had bad relations we wouldnt be honoring the 30th it would be okay here comes the 30th anniversary who cares
37214 i know its important for our generals and admirals to deal with their counterparts and i believe more importantly or as importantly we ought to be getting younger chinese officers involved with younger u s officers why to create a feeling of trust
37215 an american president has got to know two things one the nature of the person hes dealing with and the nature of the government hes dealing with and the pressures that government feels
37216 as you know im a believer in human dignity and human rights
37217 and if we do well be gracious in victory and if we dont well be humble in defeat
37218 see one of my concerns is that we that america gets so comfortable they say who cares what does it matter whether or not somebody has got hiv aids
37219 one thing that interests me is to watch chinas leaders deal with the benefits and challenges of a marketplace in other words this is a country that has got a lot of mouths to feed and a lot of people to employ
37220 and yet i can report to you that we he and hu jintao do have cordial relaxed conversations in spite of the fact that we both have interpreters its much easier when you are dealing with a person that speaks your own language since the only one i speak is english its important to have english speakers but here is a man who i have had some i feel comfortable talking about his family and he asks about mine and that may sound trite to you but nevertheless its a part of getting comfortable with each other
37221 you know the thing that amazes me the south korean women golfers
37222 theres a lot of people in this country saying why are you going forward when you cant trust them and my answer is why dont we go forward with a process that will enable us to trust them
37223 its interesting that im giving a speech about the whole far east in thailand
37224 well because its first of all the assumption is that when you give a comprehensive speech in the far east it would be in you know china or japan or you know and thailand is one a long time friend two is an important part of asean in other words theres the far east is more than just the countries that dominate the news
37225 and so therefore if youre going to give a comprehensive speech you give it in a country that makes it just by the sight alone indicates how comprehensive the policy must be in other words you cant ignore other countries if you focus only on a few
37226 the thai the thai people were just fabulous and always have been
37227 and im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman
37228 im going to have a dinner with president hu jintao who i like
37229 people i can remember going to a department store and nobody had seen a westerner and they were amazed when i would go and i would go with my mother and my sister and they were amazed it was like we were like from a different planet
37230 i said she amp squo s worthy of coming on the show
37231 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
37232 he served really well so it was always going to be a hard match
37233 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
37234 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open for the moment its just all a blur i mean its so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
37235 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
37236 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
37237 i dont know what to take out of this match
37238 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well
37239 it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
37240 hes doing well and i have done well in the past as well
37241 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the us open
37242 oh for the love of god this race card thing is so tired
37243 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
37244 maybe in a few years we might have a yellow but some companies try for ever and dont have the success they would like
37245 the future is today because new fiber and resin are available every day
37246 i want delegates to focus on the fact that there is only one poll that matters and that is on election day
37247 itll be a very strong message that there is no room for complacency the hard work lies in front of us and nothing should be taken for granted
37248 i dont think the country is crying out for radical change but weve got a very clear view about economically where we want to take new zealand and how we might achieve that
37249 revel is mourning the loss of several of its team members
37250 the design team was heading to minnesota for a glass manufacturing meeting
37251 all entry has been via balconies or insecure windows this person has no concern whether anyone is home however has shown no propensity to violence when he has been interrupted he fled from the scene
37252 we can also assume he is reasonably athletic because he is targeting second and third floor apartments where people usually feel secure enough to not lock doors and windows
37253 a hope for all humanity the first environmental city of the 21st century
37254 the american government has vetted us but theyre not behind us
37255 war is not in our vocabulary unless eritrea invades our territory
37256 in ethiopias view war is not an option at all unless eritrea violates the territorial integrity of ethiopia
37257 the risk of escalation of tension in the border area and a resumption of hostilities by accident or design following the withdrawal of unmee remains a reality
37258 we want to assure the international community that ethiopia as always is ready to resolved this impasse created by eritrea through peaceful means
37259 we will continue to cooperate with the u n to resolve this
37260 this is the first full offseason ive had with the guys they worked pretty hard we went four days a week with conditioning over the summer weve had good attendance turnout and enthusiasm so with three days of conditioning this week theyre ready to get the balls out and get busy
37261 coming off the 0 10 season its a struggle but our guys have been working hard in the offseason the players are probably more excited than the coaches because the transition from one year to the next is just night and day
37262 theres a lot of learning stuff going on were looking forward to the week where we get to pad it up and really start getting after it
37263 i think weve done a little better each year and i think were going to do the same this year
37264 right now its all learn the offense learn the formations timing things up
37265 that was the goal for our camp and these two or three days here by the time were done here everything is timed up and ready to go and then well be able to go at it once we get the pads on
37266 you always want to have as many kids out as you can especially for depth purposes
37267 last year i think we ended the season with 40 to 45 kids right now ive got about 60 on the roster well see how that plays out the closer we get to the season but right now everyones showing up
37268 its long but the day is finally here so thats the good thing
37269 everything seems ok except when he really opens it up
37270 were going to get him checked out with an mri just to make sure theres nothing going on in there that we dont know about but i think its getting closer and hopefully by this weekend well be able to really test it out
37271 the police girl who answered my call said if the police were interested in what i had to say they would get in touch with me which they didnt
37272 the circumstances in the death in this case cover the search when public funds are expended and if i can reduce the funds expended on the search in a similar case then i will endeavour to do so
37273 the coronial service unit would not pay for family to attend an inquest from overseas
37274 the track sort of goes round a rock i got lost there once
37275 shows how little experience the police have when it comes to search and rescue
37276 to me it was the obvious place they should have looked first
37277 my personal opinion is they shouldnt have stopped at griffey they should have had a fire sale dunn arroyo encarnacion
37278 the season is already over with so they need to go to next year this frees up a lot of money for next year you needed to do something
37279 i still wanted to see griffey retire as a red
37280 cincinnati management is a bunch of morons they showed griffey in a white sox cap and i was appalled
37281 they got two players who wont add up to what griffey is
37282 right now these players look like crap on paper but you dont know what youre getting yet
37283 i dont know theyre still my team they made a foolish mistake
37284 hey folks i wanted to let you know that new toolbar pagerank values should become visible over the next few days im expecting that also in the next few days that well be expiring some older penalties on websites
37285 that doesnt work anymore said klau because the company today can spot these swarms and
37286 we are far more perceptive when it comes to these link swarms that show up in a matter of hours or days
37287 think about what people are going to type in to try and find you
37288 you have to make sure the keywords are on the page
37289 what would be the one thing i can do tomorrow to improve rankings on my website
37290 yeah sure its woo hoo for massachusetts like great for people in massachusetts and california and it definitely is a step forward but its not new york
37291 i have no need to go someplace else and have another ceremony what i want is the piece of paper from the state of new york
37292 we are one of the most progressive states in the union and we should set an example for the rest of the country and well get there so im waiting for us
37293 when letterman is doing top ten lists about something it has officially entered the public consciousness
37294 if we keep getting the rain like this we should have no problems
37295 it means its been a very positive month for rain and i just hope it continues into august and september
37296 but we were also in a similar position this time last year so everybody is remaining cautious
37297 ive been away for 10 days and when i got back a couple of days ago the crops were looking quite good
37298 the average around here is about 41mm or 42mm and i have measured 34 6mm so its not far off
37299 there have been lots of little dribbles and i guess its the same as in other places
37300 its been tough on the crops but there has been decent rainfall which has kept things damp
37301 in the mallee there is a 40 per cent chance of above normal falls
37302 most of the rest of northern victoria has a 45 per cent chance of exceeding normal rainfall
37303 july has also been cold with most overnight and daytime temperatures averaging about half a degree below normal
37304 our staff went out and looked at the site on tuesday afternoon and they found what they believed to be a small amount of asbestos sheeting
37305 we will now look at our options of how best to dispose of it
37306 weve heard some thought that it might have come from an old building but were not sure
37307 theres no question that it would have been under water for a couple of years and while its reasonably heavy it might have moved when there was water in the lake
37308 were going to investigate and take a look at the rest of the lake to see whether there is asbestos in other areas
37309 we need to ascertain the extent of the problem and then work out an appropriate way of disposing of it
37310 representatives from each of the associations met together with all of council
37311 we talked at length with them and also showed a five minute dvd about the conditions each of our sports are playing in
37312 council listened to our proposal and received our presentation well
37313 we want a yes no or a maybe so we can begin applying for grants and other means of support for the building
37314 we would like to know whether they think it can be in one multi purpose stadium other smaller buildings or a showcourt built onto horsham stadium
37315 we know that this is not for this years budget but for the future the important thing is that we start moving on it now
37316 it has not progressed much further than the council meeting
37317 the issue is still with council we appreciate the situation but have to address all needs
37318 warrnambool hamilton and bairnsdale have all built new stadiums recently
37319 we asked council about what we could do and how they could support us
37320 i have been playing there for 40 years and i am sick of the smell
37321 we have a tournament there a week after the sheep show and it will stink
37322 we have moved all round horsham and we are not the only association that has had to move
37323 we are at the st brigids college gym at present but we can only use it on certain nights and not in school holidays badminton is in a similar situation
37324 we cannot advertise for more players because we are at capacity as it is
37325 this is our standard budget allocation for each year however there are some new areas of funding that are in relation to geriatric emergency management and chemotherapy
37326 there was a growth in emergency patients last year and the cost to treat those people right across the state has increased including at east wimmera
37327 he said that he felt inspired after such a visit to a remote secondary school and he made numerous references to his visit
37328 the enthusiasm of the place is infectious the community involvement is something to be copied by other school communities throughout victoria
37329 this school community admired him many of whom felt they knew him well and trusted him totally the lunches attended by community members and senior members in the school hall with this quiet gentle man will be remembered by many
37330 on a personal level after almost 20 years as a principal of high schools in this state including 10 years at wangaratta i can honestly say he is the one minister for education who provided true leadership in what were some of the most difficult times faced by schools in victoria
37331 this is really the personal picture of lindsay thompson that perhaps is missed in many headlines
37332 geogen victoria believes that the generation of base load geothermal power on the three exploration areas in victoria will be able to compete with the burning of dirty la trobe valley lignites even without the need for carbon offsets or an emissions trading scheme
37333 we are planning to drill up to 30 shallow scout holes to determine the areas geothermal gradient that is the level of high grade heat which can be used for the generation of geothermal base load electricity
37334 we are very confident in our exploration otherwise we wouldnt have initiated the project
37335 we expect to know sooner rather than later in less than five years
37336 the location of the scout holes is being finalised but all will be close to high voltage transmission lines connected to the national electricity grid
37337 its an ideal terrain for geothermal energy resources it will be able to provide a large source of energy in the area and encourage the growth of industries that require heat
37338 that means there will be 80 per cent more trucks on what we already have
37339 about 120 000 tonnes of grain a year come from the jeparit rainbow and yaapeet areas so that works out to 3428 truck movements
37340 from hopetoun and beulah there is 170 000 tonnes of grain a year so that equals 9857 trucks
37341 yarriambiack shire council would need 1 million to maintain roads
37342 roads near rainbow would need 250 000 for upkeep and that situation would be even more unacceptable because the trucks would be going through a residential area
37343 we havent got a date but weve previously been assured she would meet with us
37344 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
37345 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since

37350 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
37351 people have said to me from the day i took this job that its the worst job in australian politics
37352 having been the former president of the australian medical association im not quite sure that thats the case but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
37353 im absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us to the next election
37354 i said to him last week when i had a lengthy chat with him that i expect he will announce that when he is ready to do so
37355 i talk to peter and others in my front and backbench frequently and peter has been extraordinarily supportive of me
37356 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
37357 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
37358 people like andrew robb who is sitting quietly in the wings julie bishop even tony abbott
37359 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
37360 people like andrew robb who is sitting quietly in the wings julie bishop even tony abbott
37361 the whale is very weak and because it is so young it is unlikely to survive without its mother
37362 pushing the whale back out to sea in such a delicate condition is likely to be counter productive and can hinder rescue efforts
37363 we appreciate the good intentions of the public but to give any beached whale or dolphin the best possible chance for survival it is important that we have experienced whale handlers on hand so the animal can be properly assessed and appropriate action can be taken
37364 whales strand for a reason and that is usually because they are dying
37365 whales and dolphins can be extremely dangerous and should be approached with care a dying whale or dolphin can kill a person with its tail
37366 following these rains vegetation flourished and has increased the dry fuel load
37367 drier winter months coupled with the low humidity and gusty westerly winds which traditionally arrive at this time of year increase the threat of bushfire

37370 people are haunted by the idea from the intellectual heights that life is in reality absurd
37371 for two months now humanitarian workers have been ordered to stay in their offices instead of delivering aid to vulnerable children and families un agencies have been blocked when trying to access areas of greatest need humanitarian workers are routinely harassed and intimidated and the financial resources of many organizations have been impounded by the zimbabwean authorities
37372 i would like to talk to someone about accepting christ as my savior

37377 waiter rant thanks for the tip confessions of a cynical waiter
37378 it definitely gets you nervous when you see them out there talking up a storm and everything like that when you get out there you just play football you dont try to think about that you just try to do what you have to do within the play and within the scheme of the offense and just try to help out as much as possible but going against those guys knowing what kind of a reputation they do have definitely is intimidating at times
37379 i think its more of tough love they just tell me to have high expectations for yourself the scheme somewhat is what im familiar with at uconn from previous years it definitely is a lot to learn within the scheme because its a lot more complicated i think im picking it up kind of smoothly but i still have a long way to go
37380 i really have no control over it i just have to make the best out of the situation that im in each time i come out of the practice field whether were inside or outside i just have to go out there and compete
37381 just trying to play as strong as possible all the time i put myself in the best situation that i can basically listen to coach mike maser my offensive line coach and him giving me the proper fundamentals and techniques that puts me in the position to be that way
37382 i think my run blocking was a big concern for me but with the techniques ive been learning its definitely made it a little bit easier and i still have a long way to go in the run blocking also with pass protection i have to move my feet a lot more theyre a lot faster at this level then they are in college im just trying to adjust to the speed of the pass rusher so moving my feet is a big thing also in pass protection
37383 all the time hes told me to set off the ball a lot more when im up too close sometimes the defenders can get a jump on me make sure that in certain situations you have to know what it is you have to know if you have to get out of your stance quicker on third and long because they are really going to be putting their ears back and coming just listening to vernon vernon knows what hes talking about samsons satele been out there for a year justin smiley has been in this this has been his fifth year and jakes long a great player just listen to all of those guys then you have the guys behind you that have played before too everyone around me has been giving me tips and really helping me out

37396 the nations economy has continued to expand and remains fundamentally resilient
37397 i have an unmatched record in fighting wasteful earmarks and unnecessary spending in the u s senate and i have the determination and experience to do the same as president
37398 will restore balance and fairness to our economy by cutting wasteful spending shutting corporate loopholes and tax havens and rolling back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans while making health care affordable and putting a middle class tax cut in the pocket of 95 percent of workers and their families

37405 sba may want to examine its size decision to confirm whether it made the proper finding and determine whether it is appropriate for blackwater affiliates to continue receiving small business set aside contracts
37406 in order to be able to fulfill its obligations under the contract it appears that blackwater was required to do more than merely hire and train the security professionals and provide them to the state department
37407 expert accounting and outside legal counsel have determined that blackwaters classification of security personnel as independent contractors is reasonable correct and legally protected
37408 if you are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
37409 the clear intention behind this move is to chill the cubicles by suppressing any uncontrolled information

37455 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
37456 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
37457 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant

37460 the verse means you will not be able to incline equally or have equal amount of feeling for both of them as this is not under your control and since it is not under your control you are not required to do it
37461 o allah this is what i can control and you know about what i cannot control
37462 you know learn how to summon a premonition i mean cecile does she even uses spells sometimes
37463 and i doubt that ceciles control over her own premonitions is that great besides i tried it once some four years ago and it didnt work
37464 this is a waste of our time i should have told olivia when she asked me lets get out of here
37465 cmon phoebe olivia may be a little direct at times but she isnt cruel at least not deliberately
37466 you werent there paige she really seemed bent upon putting jason through the wringer
37467 from what ive heard hes the only one who has a motive to kill wolfie
37468 jeez phoebe lighten up as for jason im sure that olivia and darryl were only doing their jobs does olivia still believe that jasons guilty
37469 whats the problem or maybe theres a reason for olivias attitude toward jason
37470 like what according to jason they had a mutual breakup
37471 would you take a look at that were in the presence of a goddess
37472 hmmm couldnt one be anymore obvious shes practically a walking ad for sex
37473 i guess you know what that means okeefe has found someone to replace dear old wolfie
37474 but im sure that the lady can answer for herself
37475 yes of course my name is portia della scalla im originally from venice italy i have spent the last seven years writing about food and restaurants for various magazines and newspapers including here in the united states
37476 well i believe that says it all even mr okeefe seemed impressed by your as uh qualifications when will you be available to begin work
37477 if you insist uh some of mr manns belongings are still inside his office i guess we can find a desk for you until his office is cleared
37478 oh one more thing signor okeefe has informed me that this signor mann was involved in a story when he died i would be more than happy to complete the assignment
37479 im sure that mr okeefe can find something new for you
37480 but this is the golden horn restaurant we are talking about
37481 i have heard of it and the owner gweneth mcneill she is one of the worlds most renowned chefs and her son bruce who is the current executive chef is developing his own reputation also i understand that the restaurant will be celebrating its silver anniversary you want to forget about the story
37482 places like elizas la taqueria the sears coffee shop and zarzuela
37483 believe me i do but i also believe that an excellent restaurant is an excellent restaurant no matter the price of the meal and if there is an excellent restaurant in this city it is my job as a food critic to write about it
37484 well ms della scalla youve got my vote the golden horn story will continue
37485 grazie uh do you know if signor mann had left any notes on the story
37486 dewolfe manns sister and shes here to collect his personal belongings
37487 you shouldnt even be in here at least not until i clear out wolfies belongings
37488 who is this woman and why is she in this office
37489 my name is portia della scalla i am so sorry for the loss of your husband
37490 and thanks i think so what are you doing here
37491 miss della scalla has been hired as one of our new food critics shell be taking over your brothers column
37492 uh thank you for your kind words miss della scalla
37493 ms mann would like to be alone while she gathers her brothers belongings
37494 why dont you go ahead deborah theres someone i need to speak with
37495 deborah mann shes here to gather her brothers personal belongings from his office
37496 oh thats right wolfie had told me that you were his lawyer and his sisters
37497 dont worry im not going to hurt you or anything like that
37498 you see that woman with your boyfriend and the skinny guy outside dewolfes office
37499 no she had introduced herself as portia della scalla apparently shes been hired to take over dewolfes column
37500 oh my god lee had been right i didnt realize they would replace wolfie so soon
37501 do me a favor will you keep an eye on her ive got a very funny feeling about ms della scalla
37502 what feeling are you saying that shes some kind of warlock or demon
37503 maybe i dont know just keep an eye on her okay i find it highly suspicious that dewolfes old position would be filled within a few days after he was killed
37504 if youre so suspicious about this woman cole why dont you just tell the police you dont need me as a spy and im sure that olivia would be more than happy to help you
37505 besides the last time you had asked me for a favor a certain slumlord ended up dead
37506 but youre right im probably better off telling olivia and darryl ill be seeing olivia this evening anyway see you around
37507 buena sera my name is portia della scalla i have just been hired as a columnist for the san francisco bay mirror
37508 i understand that a certain signor dewolfe mann was supposed to write an article about your restaurant as it so happens i have been assigned to write the story in his place
37509 so you youll be writing the article instead on the restaurant
37510 by the way when will you be available for the first interview tomorrow this evening
37511 i came to see how youre doing i havent heard from you in nearly a week
37512 trying to become acquainted with the cases ive been assigned
37513 cmon paul i havent heard hide or hair of you since that day you came by the house that was almost a week ago and i think we both know why
37514 yeah im im sorry its just finding out that olivia is friends with a demon
37515 and that i cant understand leo i mean why why would any of you associate yourselves with a demon a notorious killer like belthazor
37516 lately ive been having suspicions that olivia and cole were more than just friends that they were attracted to each other
37517 but im not sure its been nearly six months and they havent you know start dating
37518 i think cole still hopes that he will win back phoebe someday
37519 he might be using olivia to make phoebe jealous and olivia might be free after all
37520 and considering the way she warmed up to you at our house i dont think you should give up on her at least not yet
37521 maybe youre right maybe its time i pay olivia a visit
37522 i need a half a gram of wool and quick
37523 most of the people in the bio fuel field have lots of big hopes but i think we have to test it before we say anything because the reality is not that
37524 bio diesel will have good financial benefits at the moment it costs quite a lot compared to crude oil but we have crude oil only for another 40 or 50 years before we go to that stage we should start and look at other possible sources
37525 initially we had an energy crisis now we have converted that into an energy crisis plus a food crisis the main thing is we should not touch the land available for food crops and we should not use any food product to make bio fuels
37526 jason bay is the most underrated player in the national league
37527 he can do many things well ive always enjoyed watching him he can run play defense hit hit for power hell grow on you when you see him every day because hes a quality all around player
37528 no question about that but jason can do a lot of things that manny cant do he brings a lot to the table
37529 i definitely believe in plastic surgery i dont want to be an old hag theres no fun in that
37530 i might not act any more i am quite interested in becoming a doctor i am thinking i might go back to school i found the whole movie star thing very shocking and not really what i was after there can be pockets of time where your brain is not working quite as much as you might like it to i miss that
37531 every relationship ive been in ive overwhelmed the girl they just cant handle all the love
37532 one day there may be a wife but for now im just interviewing for the position

37553 im fine i have no pain im just trying to get stronger on this knee little by little im getting better and moving better
37554 at the important times i really raised my level and won it in two sets
37555 but this is good for the future you learn little things playing against a world no 2
37556 wozniak is a little more aggressive she goes for it a bit more and tends to make a lot more unforced errors
37557 dubois is more consistent she moves really well its hard to make a point on her you really have to earn it
37558 i actually beat the ranking record which was 142 i think im about 120 now no 142 is the greatest portuguese player in history
37559 every week people are coming in and dropping off more its from voter registration drives
37560 it appears there is a coordinated and widespread effort to commit voter fraud
37561 im not even going to dignify that stuff with a response
37562 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
37563 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
37564 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
37565 a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
37566 senator obama and i faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
37567 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
37568 im thrilled to have matt spezza back with the generals
37569 ive been in constant contact with matt throughout his rehabilitation process and the commitment that i see hes giving not only rehabbing his injury but working on his overall conditioning tells me that matt spezza is determined to make a name for himself in the ihl this season
37570 there was an article in the daily mail today which showed that the biggest cause of fertility problems in women is stress
37571 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case
37572 he wont hurt no one else in the world like he did those two women
37573 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it
37574 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
37575 i dont think it will leave me for a while
37576 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
37577 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
37578 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
37579 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
37580 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
37581 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
37582 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling
37583 mr hamdan said he was convinced by the need for seeking jihad
37584 undoubtedly an unpleasant highly regimented experience with instant rewards or loss of privileges for infractions
37585 its very clear there isnt going to be a deal but nobody is going to say that out loud its better to show the process is still going on
37586 trade was great if i could find a stronger word than great i would use that
37587 while growth continues to be disappointing trade provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture raising questions about barack obamas policy of economic isolationism
37588 lets see how this works before we throw any more short term money at the economy
37589 nothing in todays gdp numbers was positive for families trying to find a job or pay to fill up their tank
37590 that is why we need a second 50 billion stimulus package that both relieves the burden on middle class families and helps to jump start job creation
37591 the consumer adds only 1 1 percentage point to overall growth and this is with a rebate check in hand
37592 gdp was net negative on the domestic front as we look to the second half of the year foreign growth is fading so u s exports are sure to slow also the rebate checks no longer are a factor meanwhile the housing sector is still a negative
37593 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers
37594 on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
37595 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
37596 katee and joshua when theyre together true magic happens on that stage
37597 its very clear there isnt going to be a deal but nobody is going to say that out loud its better to show the process is still going on
37598 a beating heart is the core of what we are going to be doing in the next several years with open source and linux
37599 number one are our products likely to be open sourced no
37600 we do provide our source code in special situations but open source also implies free free is inconsistent with paying for lunches at the partner conference applause with that said there are a number of different things will we interoperate with products that come from like linux from the open source world yes we will
37601 microsoft wants people to build code to the windows platform rather than gnu linux but the fsfs view is to build an ecosystem with free software
37602 its nothing thats easy to get through but were hanging in there
37603 from grand avenue to adams no signal stops so its about six blocks they drive really fast
37604 speeders who care nothing about the consequences of their actions
37605 lets face it they dont really fear getting a ticket but what they do fear is losing their drivers license
37606 he actually had been warned by the department of motor vehicles about his dangerous driving and that if he continued to drive that way it would result in some type of injury or death
37607 if this was passed a long time ago he wouldve never been on the road and that would never have happened to my sister
37608 its really good because theres people out there that dont know how to drive they really need to get their license taken away
37609 a beating heart is the core of what we are going to be doing in the next several years with open source and linux
37610 number one are our products likely to be open sourced no

37618 because bushs environmental protection agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution california is forced to seek judicial action
37619 the language on the icc sends the wrong signal to a man who presided over genocide
37620 it is likely that we will discuss this the deferral request again over the coming months
37621 but the focus now should be on renewing the unamid mandate and showing solid council support for what is a very different mission in the field
37622 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
37623 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
37624 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
37625 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
37626 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
37627 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
37628 we know virtually nothing about this art thats the exciting part of this discovery
37629 what we need to do now is to discover how this art relates to other prehistoric features in the landscape
37630 we are talking about very simple and abstract art using circles lines and triangles mostly the designs are pecked into stone in the shape of simple cups and rings

37693 manny obviously will be in the middle of that lineup and were just going to have to as we go along try to figure it out ill probably get the whole team in there together before we break up for our normal meetings just to sort of give them some thoughts i really dont know whos going to get impacted the most on this thing
37694 the church has only itself to blame for giving the impression that it is in the business of saving souls only the environment is what we are about
37695 if we do not pay attention to the health of all creation the other issues will not be important
37696 today cashew nuts have gone mad with trees dropping their nuts out of season we have messed up the environment in such a way that even the production of cashew nuts is unpredictable
37697 stories shared from bishops around the communion give a picture of a global crisis
37698 there are many examples including water pollution dumping of toxic waste air pollution deforestation irresponsible dumping of garbage
37699 environment is the top priority for some provinces and must be a high priority for all of us in the global south safeguarding creation is a day to day activity not an intellectual exercise
37700 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
37701 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
37702 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
37703 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
37704 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
37705 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
37706 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
37707 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
37708 its important because it tells us there is a risk in using just one model its quite true that you should have different approaches and methods it just makes the results more robust
37709 the draft is one step in the process of addressing tangata whenua values and interests including involvement of iwi and hapu in the management of fresh water
37710 our cooperation in the fields of education defence law and culture have also expanded
37711 within asean we have worked together to advance our integration efforts
37712 at the people to people level more singaporeans are visiting vietnam and some are even learning the language
37713 the introduction of tanks into this fight eliminated one of the advantages the insurgents had hiding in the grape fields which are very easy to defend and very difficult to attack
37714 of course there is a place for main battle tanks in the all arms battle group and it would be foolish to ditch them all just because we happen to be in a counter insurgency battle in afghanistan just now the two gulf wars showed that in recent times
37715 however money rules and tanks are expensive bits of machinery to keep unused just in case
37716 ieds have grown dramatically they are going for a catastrophic kill
37717 one of the great paradoxes of having tanks is that although they are one of the most formidable fighting machines out here they tend to have a calming effect as soon as we turn up the fight tends to end without us firing a shot
37718 a year ago we could drive where we wanted wed go bombing across the fields because it was safer that going on the roads
37719 this tank is a waste of taxpayer dollars that will not help us in afghanistan and once we are out of afghanistan will only become a 650 million dollar rusted monument to the outdated cold war thinking that still holds sway over our military
37720 this mission provides nasa with a unique opportunity to evaluate how our nanosatellite spacecraft and its payload perform while demonstrating our ability to conduct fast turn around low cost spaceflight projects
37721 this collaborative mission has enabled nasa to demonstrate and support cutting edge technologies
37722 we have an experimental payload loaded into an experimental satellite onboard a privately developed vehicle
37723 were thrilled with this opportunity to combine our solar sail experience and technology with a new way of doing business

37741 almost by accident however the owners of the huffington post had discovered a formula that capitalized on the problems confronting newspapers in the internet era and they are convinced that they are ready to reinvent the american newspaper
37742 i think politics will always be a focus of huffington post
37743 but yeah were certainly trying to branch out to other areas as any newspaper would
37744 i think the idea is to be very bloggy its going to be very opinionated
37745 i dont think the media needs yet another how to communicate better with your spouse story
37746 i definitely dont want to think of us as competing with other publications
37747 but i think the style outlets that i respect a lot are style section
37748 some of the stories will have a political angle but not even 50 of them will but yes well certainly be paying attention to what people wear during the election
37749 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
37750 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
37751 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
37752 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
37753 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
37754 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
37755 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
37756 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader

37760 we were a bit delayed as he took time to shake hands speak to troops and pose for photographs
37761 orthodoxy claims to be universal not something exotic and oriental but simple christianity
37762 of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined which are preserved in the church some we possess derived from written teaching others we have received delivered to us
37763 time will fail me if i attempt to recount the unwritten mysteries of the church
37764 for were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority on the ground that the importance they possess is small we should unintentionally injure the gospel in its very vitals
37765 while the unwritten traditions are so many and their bearing on
37766 i would also dispute the idea that protestants agree on all the essential doctrines pp 6 he meant that they disagree on those things which they consider to be essential
37767 the double bond of unity in the faith and communion in the sacraments
37768 no one with an equivalent position to the pope in the roman catholic church
37769 their church is something more than a group of local bodies
37770 the double bond of unity in the faith and communion in the sacraments
37771 no one with an equivalent position to the pope in the roman catholic church
37772 you would need to define what kind of veneration and honour you were referring to
37773 the double bond of unity in the faith and communion in the sacraments
37774 amongst themselves yes but not with the one true church
37775 the orthodox are divided up into nineteen traditions the roman catholics have sixteen and the protestants have twenty one if we throw the anglicans in they account for another six far from bedlam this appears to be simply the cost of the gospel doing business in a fallen world but whichever door you choose you have lots of work for private judgment to do in following up that choice
37776 i could not with any intellectual honesty say that i upheld the nicene creed and remain protestant

37778 because we are not used to this kind of event just the gruesomeness of it is a bit like experiencing an earthquake the ground beneath you psychologically never feels quite secure again
37779 people get so caught up in the memories of it it just affects who they are on a day to day basis
37780 it used to be that a very large percentage of parents wanted a good solid ordinary name for their child
37781 we all want our kids to be distinctive and thats created a kind of arms race because we might want to be different from one another but our tastes are very much the same
37782 parents type a first and last name into google and feel panicked when its taken or when the domain name is taken
37783 when angelina jolie and brad pitt named their daughter vivienne i had multiple people writing to me who had that name or a similar name chosen and felt like it had been ruined
37784 theres nothing worse than being nine months pregnant due any day and having no clue what youre going to call this child
37785 a lot of people were really cruel when it came out that we wanted to change her name
37786 i just wanted a name that when i yelled it on the playground i didnt get 12 kids running
37787 these days it doesnt seem like any name no matter how ridiculous is off the table
37788 let me tell you no one was shy in the least
37789 all i heard for months was i dont like brandon that reminds me of this jerk i went to high school with and on and on it went
37790 while i know hell definitely be made fun of in school hell still have it easy compared to the kids whose parents named them after some kind of beverage stereo equipment or someone elses occupation
37791 people tend to favour the familiar and unusual names ironically are more familiar to people because they only need to hear them once or perhaps twice to remember them

37793 we give warnings but people still take part in these antics
37794 at the beginning self esteem is a part of risk taking when we do something that others perceive as dangerous it gives us a buzz and makes us feel good about ourselves more kudos can be acquired by pushing the risks ever further
37795 there is also a psychological explanation known as reversal theory that might help explain why people engage in dangerous things it says that we experience arousal in different ways when we are in a playful mode risky things that would otherwise cause us great anxiety actually create a feeling of excitement there is initially a sense of apprehension and fear but once the jump has been successfully completed that high arousal gives way to a sense of euphoria
37796 i once knew a partner at a large firm who told me this

37815 i love the sound of the human voice and listening to languages that i dont speak the way people talk their rhythm tells a story
37816 people are thrilled to see their language represented and are equally disappointed when they cant find it

37846 he did what all of our guards do and kept walking
37847 the kids at the shows will have kids of their own
37848 the two had a disagreement the night before and apparently he was dwelling on that
37849 and in that state of mind he apparently came to the conclusion that this was what he was going to do he formulated this within reason over a few hours before he killed her
37850 she was the kind of person who wouldnt give up on someone i was very surprised she would stay in that type of relationship
37851 maybe she just wanted to help she always wanted to take someone under her wing it is all very very sad and the family is just devastated
37852 if we could have bought 24 hours time this may have never happened
37853 is this the culmination of one day or years of depression well never know

37859 we ought to start drilling for more oil at home including offshore
37860 nobody here thinks john mccain has a real new idea about how we are going to solve our countrys problems
37861 seems to believe offshore drilling is a winning campaign issue and a way to get us out of a recession
37862 he is trying to reframe the argument about the economy
37863 he was blaming me for high oil prices so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have real answers for the challenges we face
37864 so what they are going to do is try to make you scared of me
37865 we want to send a clear signal there will be zero tolerance when it comes to planned parenthoods campaign to sexualize children
37866 the california pro lifers especially ana jaime are to be commended for their courageous work
37867 the greater vallejo recreational district has done the right thing by keeping planned parenthood as far away from children as possible
37868 d emocratic practices abroad meant nothing at home when it was a question of athenian self interest the assembly might readily fight to exterminate democracies like syracuse 415 413 athenians fought for two years against syracuse the only other large democracy in the greek world
37869 t he south was not a sovereign democracy at that time president jefferson davis was not elected but appointed by representatives selected by confederate states there was an election in 1861 but it was not competitive
37870 the two major political parties alternated in power not by election but by arrangement preceding elections

37878 regretfully this means that senator hillary clinton is no longer under consideration as senator obamas running mate
37879 all indications we have from people close to senator clinton and senator obama are that hillary is not on the short list
37880 its so beautifully arranged on the plate you know someones fingers have been all over it
37881 in cooking youve got to have a what the hell attitude
37882 this is probably the most provocative hypothesis i have ever and will ever advance
37883 cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations
37884 the side employing a relatively higher personal focus in their attacks on the other sides ideas
37885 apparently our addition of nine molecules of carbon dioxide to each 100 000 molecules of air over the last 150 years can now be blamed for anything and everything we choose
37886 the warming that allowed the vikings to farm in greenland 1 000 years ago was surely natural but we are now told that warming in greenland today is surely manmade glaciers retreating in western canada have revealed evidence of previous forests showing that warming and cooling cycles do indeed occur even without suvs yet the suv is now the scapegoat for retreating glaciers
37887 but mccain has made it clear that the science really does not matter anyway because even if humans are not to blame for global warming stopping carbon dioxide emissions is the right thing to do and if we had another choice for most of our energy needs i might be willing to accept such a claim as harmless enough
37888 but carbon dioxide is necessary for life on earth and i have a difficult time calling something so fundamentally important a
37889 so here we are with bad science ready to support bad policy decisions that will lead to bad economic times ahead and no presidential candidate who is willing to ask the hard questions
37890 no we cant measure the heat content of the entire earth
37891 is this something that should lead us to doubt model predictions of global warming
37892 this is not an exacting recipe its hash or hamburger helper not souffl
37893 what value does roy use for the mixed layer depth one kilometer to be sure on the centennial scale some heat does get buried several hundred meters deep in the ocean at least in some limited parts of the ocean however to assume that all radiative imbalances are instantaneously mixed away to a depth of 1000 meters is oceanographically ludicrous
37894 give me 4 parameters and i will fit an elephant five and i will make him wiggle his trunk
37895 the satellite data set confirms that the climate is warming
37896 global warming stopped in 1998 meme is nonsense just go check our earlier posts on the subject raypierre
37897 i predict that there will be an increasing number of scientific publications in the coming years describing newly found stabilizing processes in the climate system
37898 who would use climate change to bring about a dictatorship of the proletariat
37899 or you will become like those fastidious people who polish and polish until there is nothing left
37900 given 8 free parameters we could fit the new york skyline
37901 clouds are a different matter while theres no credible evidence for a significant stabilizing cloud feedback one cant easily rule that out on basic physical grounds
37902 now if you meant the other red curve in the graph below that is not from data at all that is what you would get from roys combination of the pdo and so indices using his scaling factor if you dont hide the amplitude by taking a five year running mean
37903 and besides the soi pdo example took me 1 hour on a weekend with a very simple single idea internet access and an excel spreadsheet
37904 in fact both forster and held had to construct their own simple models of the effect to understand what i was talking about so that they could convince themselves now i am not a modeler im more of an observationalist why did it take someone like me to point this out before anyone else in the modeling community discovered it im not funded to do this stuff they are
37905 the ipcc among others nailed that and nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
37906 since your whole website is directed at true believers and generally non technical people how about a straightforward and easy to understand article that unambiguously proves the above sentence that you repeat like a mantra yet never seem to provide comprehensible evidence for
37907 while i find some of the denier arguments dumb or disingenuous at best what you dish up on this web site is hardly reassuring either
37908 the ipcc among others nailed that and nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
37909 during the past 20 years atmospheric temperatures have actually tended to go down
37910 as shown in the second chart based on very reliable satellite data which have been confirmed by measurements from weather balloons
37911 the average lifetime of a molecule of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before it is captured by vegetation and afterward released is about twelve years
37912 it means the ice shelf is disintegrating the pieces are pinned together like a jigsaw but could float away
37913 were seeing very dramatic changes from the retreat of the glaciers to the melting of the sea ice
37914 we had 23 less sea ice last year than weve ever had and whats happening to the ice shelves is part of that picture
37915 nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
37916 when you prove to me that man is causing climate change then i will give a s t about science
37917 that now mixed in with hedge fund market manipulation and biofuel development to answer that other little problem of increasing oil prices
37918 even lindzen has abandoned his earlier claims that water vapor would prove a stabilizing feedback
37919 to the extent that the cloud changes actually cause temperature change this can ultimately lead to overestimates of how sensitive earths climate is to our greenhouse gas emissions
37920 since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the minds of the general public it is also the means of establishing a controversy
37921 is waste heat produced by human activities important for the climate no in any given period of time the sun provides almost 10000 times as much energy to
37922 in this essay however i will argue that humanity faces a much greater danger from the glaciation associated with the next ice age
37923 will solar cycle 25 mentioned earlier and predicted by nasa to be comparable to the dalton minimum be the trigger for a new ice age
37924 are we fully appreciating the point that clouds are merely a byproduct of heat being transported from the surface to upper levels the more clouds there are the more heat that has been transferred from the surface to be dissipated into the upper levels and eventually into space is it not
37925 so heres what roy did he took two indices of interannual variability the southern oscillation soi index which is a proxy for el nino and the pacific decadal oscillation index pdoi he formed an ad hoc weighted sum of these indices
37926 many people look for an spf in their sunscreen thinking that this offers them full protection against uv damage
37927 in fact the spf only shows protection against uvb which is the type of uv that causes sunburn and skin cancer
37928 its uva that causes sun induced skin ageing and also contributes towards skin cancer but the spf does not show protection against uva
37929 you need to look for specific uva filters indicated in the uk by stars or a circular uva symbol
37930 in a multi storey environment for example its difficult to have base stations around the area so we need to form an ad hoc network
37931 the purpose is to rapidly and accurate identify areas of contamination and see how to rectify the situation
37932 unless they want to go around carrying these devices thats not the best use of the technology

37965 providing input into the spp through the north american energy working group and their intentions are clear in the case of energy what they want is a fast tracked continental integration policy
37966 the first is to increase u s energy security by guaranteeing access to extensive deepwater reserves in the gulf of mexico including mexicos portion of it
37967 the second objective is to open up oil and gas production and market to foreign companies
37968 when were using taxpayer dollars we have to be fiscally responsible and another tract of land was brought to our attention
37969 a road through a park is not a good thing its not adding value to the park
37970 it runs contrary to common sense and the whole goal were trying to achieve with a park is a place you can go and get back to nature and in the outdoors
37971 nafta prevents us from selling our energy resources at rates lower than we sell them in the u s we also cant ever cut back on the proportion of energy we produce and sell to the united states even in times when our country runs short
37972 water supplies like energy supplies must be secured if the united states is to maintain its current economic and military power in the world and the united states is exerting pressure to access canadian water despite canadas own shortages
37973 among these captivating pieces are bronze strigils which were used by athletes to remove sweat and dirt from their bodies after their training sessions and tiny spherical containers called aryballoi which once contained the olive oil sportsmen applied before training and competing in local and international games
37974 ancient greece was a variety of city states so to win at the olympic games was very important as your name and the name of your state took the honour its the same today really
37975 of course the inscription would say who they were and where they came from so the city state was also targeted

37978 we believe there is some confusion among motorists about how to respond when an emergency vehicle is approaching
37979 motorists may panic when they hear a siren and slam on the brakes but drivers need to stay calm use common sense and most importantly follow the correct road rules to move safely out of the way
37980 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
37981 unless you change how you are you will always have what youve got
37982 there would have been 150 people around him trying to ask him questions
37983 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
37984 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
37985 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
37986 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
37987 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
37988 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
37989 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
37990 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
37991 its important because it tells us there is a risk in using just one model its quite true that you should have different approaches and methods it just makes the results more robust
37992 it is narrowing the gap between organic farming and conventional farming
37993 we have been exporting meat for a long time and there has been a growing demand for all organic produce in horticulture it has been the fastest growing sector
37994 the church has only itself to blame for giving the impression that it is in the business of saving souls only the environment is what we are about

38025 looking to divest the consumer electronics business as it has a disproportionately higher r amp d expense higher revenue and margin volatility and is not core to amds business
38026 in our q2 earnings report we listed both our digital tv and handheld divisions as discontinued operations due to our intention to divest
38027 we believe amds executive level changes are a signal that restructuring actions will become more visible to investors
38028 the list of actions includes new faces in many high profile roles the sale of non core businesses including the ati ce businesses both handset and digital tv product lines and lastly manufacturing base divestiture in an effort to share process technology development costs with a wider product market base
38029 in the near term we believe that broadcom is a likely candidate to acquire amds consumer tv business we also view the handset based product line as available for sale however we are unable to identify a potential buyer given the limited customer base
38030 it would be premature at this point to comment on potential negotiations
38031 we believe the revenue contribution is above 250 million per year but could grow even faster with brcms broadcoms consumer focused direct field sales network
38032 though the current gross margin is closer to amds corporate average we believe that brcm will leverage cost advantages using 65nm and finer processes with its foundry partner tsmc
38033 the future of atis embedded application processor business is more questionable as most interested companies already have in house capability in this highly crowded segment atis customer base is limited and has been losing share making the outlook harder to forecast
38034 but there is a very big difference between noam chomsky saying it and david icke saying it
38035 noam chomsky is jewish secondly noam chomsky is not mad thirdly noam chomsky is in fact an intellectual and finally noam chomsky is not an anti semite
38036 this chomsky passage regarding the oppressive subtext of the talmud
38037 theyre the ones david icke goes on about the most

38041 some people might find your creative artistic recovery disturbing their doubts will reactivate your own for they are attempts to leverage us back into our old ways for the sake of someone elses comfort not our own
38042 money will come when you are doing the right thing
38043 art is not about thinking something up its about getting something down
38044 the creative life is grounded on many many small steps and very few large leaps
38045 i love that its an international community and that its primarily focused on handmade things
38046 you can get a good price for your products and they dont charge you so much that you lose all your profits
38047 throughout history artists have been dependent on dealers and galleries
38048 now they can do their own marketing its a very empowering thing and it levels the playing field
38049 selling online is so convenient especially with having other responsibilities
38050 you can do what you love to do but you dont feel responsibility about meeting a quota or making someone else happy doing it on my time and doing what i enjoy is what makes it great
38051 putting my work out there has also brought my artwork to the attention of clients requesting commissions and retailers who wish to stock my products
38052 when ive gone in to talk to galleries and i tell them im on artspan they look at me differently
38053 i have done a few things on ebay but ebay gets so overwhelming
38054 its hard because when you do something handmade like that it kind of drowns on that site
38055 we still think ebay brings the highest buyer traffic when it comes to looking for unique unusual items and that include arts and crafts created by individuals
38056 people submit work and if i find it appropriate to my brand i accept it
38057 i would like to build the online operation to the point where i could sustain myself on it but im not close to that at this time
38058 we took a blow to the belly and kept on going forward

38118 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
38119 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
38120 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
38121 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
38122 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
38123 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
38124 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
38125 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
38126 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
38127 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
38128 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
38129 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
38130 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
38131 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
38132 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
38133 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
38134 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
38135 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
38136 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
38137 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
38138 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
38139 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
38140 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
38141 i only read the 1611 version of the king james bible
38142 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
38143 1611 version is not doing so and is actually reading a modern revision of the 1611 version
38144 kami tidak pernah merencanakan memperoleh berapa anak kami hanya menyerahkan petunjuk tuhan pada kehidupan kami
38145 it was a week after my fight and i was working out in the gym and he came in and asked me why i wanted to fight him
38146 he said he would give me money to spar with him i said i didnt want his money i wanted to fight him then he started acting crazy
38147 he pushed my trainer and he wanted me to go outside and fight him
38148 he really didnt want that because im a very good street fighter thats how i started boxing
38149 you can see all of his punches coming i was catching everything he threw even though his defense is not very good he takes a hard punch i thought it was not good for cotto to spend so much time on the ropes taking punches
38150 i was beating margarito until i hurt my hand but i never feared any of his punches because im a very good defensive fighter and i caught most of his punches
38151 even with judahs speed the defensive skills of joshua will be his advantage
38152 hes able to throw the hook to the body and the head and then protect himself
38153 i just want to beat judah and win the title
38154 you cant be soft because everyone will beat you up you have to fight every day to prove that youre a man
38155 hes a good fighter i thought he could be a little more fiery hes got a chin of granite and its almost impossible to hurt him
38156 historically they are less focused on politics but they are an emerging bloc suddenly in the last few years in both state and national elections
38157 in a number of areas theyve reached a critical level where they begin believing they can have an influence
38158 weve been ignored for the longest time and this time noticed a little more
38159 we only make up about 5 percent of the u s population nobody thought wed be that important
38160 asian americans are essentially about a decade behind where latinos are now
38161 hopefully both parties and others will pay attention to that development
38162 in a world that permits the use of violence against y by x both parties are better off when y buys off xs
38163 an anthropomorphic stamping press shouting out product lines and then changing over its dies
38164 my point is political parties and advocacy groups dont deliver liberty there is little evidence to show for that what frees people is principled defiance of tyranny despite the oft repeated myth that democracy operates with the consent of the governed the reality is that all law represents civil war against the people if there was truly consent of the governed no laws would be necessary but in fact there is no consent hence the inherent compulsion involved in any act of the legislature
38165 yet i recognize that a case by case view of right amp wrong would lead to enormous uncertainty so i guess the two views exist in tension each being important
38166 i think that in many respects a situation specific view of right amp wrong is more helpful than a categorical or deontological one
38167 that absolute leaves an apparent loophole that vulgar libertarians try to take advantage of by claiming that whatever is is right
38168 to the extent that they are entitled to eat the bread that their hand produces they are our equals
38169 the module we broke does not have any direct links with terror groups like let or simi
38170 we dont see why everyone should benefit from the huge profit on our carbon trading desk which was an aberration in an isolated part of the firm
38171 but as soon as we arrived in calcutta i knew something was wrong
38172 i didnt know what a brothel was but i could see the house she took me to was a bad house where the women wore small clothes and lots of bad men were coming in and out
38173 i wasnt allowed to ever leave i had to see 10 men a day
38174 i didnt know anything about men before it was the most terrible thing
38175 i had no idea how to get around the city but they were very clever girls
38176 i could never never tell my family what happened i told them i had been working as a maid and i missed them too much i can never never tell anyone apart from the people here never if i do nobody will marry me i would bring disgrace on my family and my life would be destroyed
38177 my brother in law sold me to the mashi here when i was 13
38178 he took me away one day and brought me here when i arrived the mashi whipped me and told me i could never leave this brothel i was devastated i hated it i kept thinking about my family my mother and crying all the time but the mashi just whipped me all the time and told me i had to work
38179 i thought i was going back to the good life
38180 no no i would hate to be a madam im a bad girl but im not that bad
38181 i know its sad thats my life story its not much is it
38182 my brother abdu saleq was our elected council member here until three years ago
38183 he thought it was his duty to stop them he thought selling women was wrong
38184 the traffickers told his wife they would kill us too
38185 we work as a watchdog at night who is trafficking how many girls are being taken as soon as something is spotted we are alerted
38186 theyve got an attitude problem theyre poor they blame anyone for their problems
38187 i ran away because my stepmother was cruel to me
38188 she made me do all the washing and cleaning for her sons
38189 and she made me collect water for the whole family every day
38190 she tried to poison me she made me some rice and i tasted a bit but it was really horrible it didnt taste right at all she told me i had to eat it so i slipped it to the dog that afternoon the dog died
38191 i miss my brothers and sisters i wish i could still play with them sometimes i think about them when im trying to sleep but no i dont miss anyone
38192 if we get stoned then it doesnt hurt if the policemen come and beat you in the night
38193 i know im a bad person and ill never get out of here theres no hope no future for me what do you think i should do
38194 its the worst place you have to work all the time there is a massive bowl and you are forced to carry it on your back and water the trees and then you have to sweep the room and scrub the floors and do hard labour and if you ever stop they beat you really hard i dont want to ever go there again they just beat you so much they beat us in the shins with sticks they hate us
38195 it is the best feeling in the world to sing
38196 i didnt think it was fair because if i was a boy i would be allowed to sing it doesnt make sense why should only boys be allowed to choose their own job men make women dependent on them and thats why they are treated badly
38197 i want to buy a tea stall i am also saving so eventually i can have a deposit to rent a room of my own no trafficker will get me there
38198 men would be nasty to me and people smoked drugs and i was scared all the time people would call me names and say my mother was a bitch
38199 now i live in the shelter i can play games and run around and everything
38200 now i am going to become a lawyer so i can help people like my mother
38201 he trafficked children because he was so poor but its no excuse
38202 i went looking for him everywhere i spent all day on the streets calling his name i couldnt believe it was happening
38203 when we got him back he was lean and thin and he cried all the time
38204 if he couldnt see me he would scream he did some very strange things he would stare at the sun until he passed out but to have him back was amazing
38205 i just thank god every day that there are people like aparajeyo working to stop them

38220 mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy requiring nothing but abundant non toxic natural materials
38221 in one hour enough sunlight strikes the earth to provide the entire planets energy needs for one year
38222 the key component in nocera and kanans new process is a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water another catalyst produces valuable hydrogen gas
38223 a catalyst is a chemical compound that acts to speed up a reaction but in the process is not itself changed therefore the catalyst at the end of the reaction is free to act again to assist another reactant through the reaction catalysts work by lowering the energy barrier between the reactants and the products
38224 so it probably requires much less electricity than traditional electrolysis
38225 with todays announcement mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy
38226 with a goal to make the large scale deployment of solar energy within 10 years

38261 dalam kedatangan kalian loolap sebenarnya harus mengundang kalian berdiam di sini beberapa hari dan bahwa loolap tidak dapat berbuat begini hatiku merasa sangat tidak enak
38262 maka sebagai gantinya loolap hanya bisa mengundang thio cinjin meneguk tiga cawan arak untuk mengunjuk hormat kami
38263 soepeh ilmu silat yang ditulis thio cinjin tidak berbeda dengan pelajaran kita semua yang telah dibaca olehku aku sudah belajar dari soehoe
38264 thay kek sip sam sit adalah mustika boe tong pay yang digubah oleh thio cinjin sendiri bagaimana kau bisa mengatakan bahwa kau sudah pernah belajar ilmu itu
38265 soeheng benar saja ilmu ini masih termasuk dalam lingkungan ilmu siauw lim sie
38266 limu silat boe tong bersumber dari siauw lim benar saja apa yang ditulis thio cinjin tidak banyak bedanya dari ilmu silat kami
38267 apa yang telah ditulis oleh si orang she thio sedikitpun aku tidak merasa menyesal
38268 aku mengerti bahwa ilmuku itu sangat cetek dan tidak berharga jika samwie tidak memerlukannya sebaiknya dibuang saja
38269 dari kata katamu thio cinjin rupanya kau tidak percaya akan pengutaraan kami itu
38270 yoe liang coba kau hafal thay kek sip sam sit dan kioe yang kang yang diturunkan olehku kepadamu
38271 dan sekarang mereka mengatakan ilmu thay soehoe tiada berbeda dengan ilmu mereka sungguh tak mengenal malu

38274 terima kasih atas petunjuk thio cinjin tapi boanpwee adalah murid siauw lim dan boan pwee mempunyai soepeh soehoe dan soesiok untuk mengajar boanpwe
38275 itulah ilmu dari thay kek sip sam sit sekarang terbukti bahwa walaupun kalian berdua paham akan ilmu itu tapi kalian belum mempunyai tempo untuk berlatih selamat tinggal
38276 apa yoe liang sudah menghafalkan seanteronya jika satu huruf saja yang kelupaan siauw lim akan menderita kerugian besar
38277 dengan terbukanya pembuluh darah racun bisa lantas masuk ke dalam isi perut dan kalau sudah masuk di situ maka sudah tentu tak akan bisa dibuyarkan lagi
38278 apa bisa jadi siauw lim kioe yang kang sedemikian hebat sehingga dalam beberapa hari saja ilmu itu sudah dapat membuka pembuluh darah
38279 tidak mungkin pasti tidak mungkin lie heng dan seng kok sudah berlatih belasan tahun tapi latihan itu masih belum cukup untuk membuka pembuluh darah
38280 nak bagaimana isi siauw lim kioe yang kang yang diturunkan kepadamu
38281 ia mengatakan bahwa ia membantu supaya aku bisa berhasil terlebih siang dalam latihan kioe yang sin kang
38282 kalau pembuluh darahmu perlu dibuka dengan segera apakah aku tidak dapat melakukan itu
38283 goan tin siansoe telah mengatakan berulang ulang bahwa ia tak tahu she dan namaku ia tak tahu rumah perguruanku dan akupun tidak perlu tahu she dan namanya
38284 belum belum pernah aku mendengar nama begitu di antara jago jago siauw lim sie hm ia tak tahu namamu tak mengenal partaimu kalau begitu ia tak tahu perhubungan antara aku dan kau kalau begitu bantuannya itu keluar dari hati yang baik
38285 cukup tak usah kau menghafal terus tujuanku hanyalah untuk mengetahui tulen palsunya ilmu yang diturunkan kepadamu mulai dari sekarang kau tidak boleh memberitahukan siauw lim kioe yang sin kang kepada siapapun jua kau mesti ingat bahwa kau tidak boleh melanggar sumpahmu yang sangat berat
38286 apakah aku masih bisa bertahan dan bisa pulang ke boe tong san dengan masih bernyawa
38287 biar bagaimanapun jua thay soehoe akan berdaya untuk menolong jiwamu
38288 kalau aku masih bisa bertemu muka dengan jie shapeh aku sudah merasa puas
38289 sebab sesudah tidak bisa hidup anak ingin membuka rahasia siauw lim kioe yang kang ke pada jie shapeh
38290 anak mengharap supaya dengan menggunakan kioe yang kang dari boe tong dan siauw lim shapeh akan dapat menyembuhkan kaki tangannya yang bercacat sesuai dengan sumpah anak akan menggorok leher sendiri seperti yang telah dilakukan ayah supaya dengan begitu anak dapat menebus sebaglan kecil dari kedosaan ibu
38291 dengan menggunakan jarum beracun ibu telah melukai jie shapeh sehingga shapeh bercacat untuk seumur hidupnya
38292 seorang laki laki harus berjalan di jalanan lurus kau sudah berjanji dengan disertai sumpah berat untuk tidak memberitahukan pelajaran siauw lim kioe yang kang kepada siapapun jua janji itu harus dipegang sampai pada akhirnya andaikata benar kau bakal mati aku juga tidak boleh berlaku licik
38293 sesudah tahu bahwa jiwanya tidak bakal tertolong lagi anak itu rela membunuh diri guna menolong thay giam jiwa yang sedemikian adalah sesuai dengan jiwa seorang pendekar rimba persilatan
38294 hentikan perahu serahkan anak itu kalau kau tidak menurut jangan katakan aku kejam
38295 siapa yang bernyali begitu besar berani memerintahkan aku menyerahkau cucu muridku

38315 biarpun kau sudah masuk kedalam agama sesat masih belum terlalu dalam jika kau mau memutar kepala masih belum terlambat aku ingin mempersembahkankan dengan beberapa perkataan dan aku harap kau tidak menjadi gusar
38316 ajaran tootiang tentulah juga berharga seperti emas dan batu kumala

38323 aku seorang wanita yang bernasib paling buruk dalam dunia ini
38324 biarlah biarlah aku menyerahkan saja segala apa kepada nasib pheng soehoe jangan kau melukai soe cieku
38325 aku siorang she pheng sebenarnya tidak mempunyai permusuhan apapun jua dengan kamu sekalian akan tetapi fitnah hebat yang dilontar kan oleh si perempuan she teng telah didengar oleh kamu semua kalau cerita ini sampai tersiar di luaran bagaimana kie kouwnio bisa berdiri terus di atas bumi ini maka itu tak bisa aku membiarkan kamu hidup terus hal ini sudah terjadi lantaran terpaksa dan aku harap kamu jangan menyalahkan aku
38326 aku tidak berani membunuh perempuan jelek yang kulitnya kering dan mulutnya lebar
38327 kalau kau mampus aku kuatir begitu lekas rohmu masuk di akhirat berlaksa laksa setan akan kabur ke dunia sebab ketakutan aku pun kuatir giam loo ong berak berak saking kagetnya
38328 kie kouwnio adalah tunangan in lioksiok perempuan she teng itu mengatakan mendapat anak siang toako bagaimana pendapatmu apa benar atau tidak
38329 kalau bertemu in liok siok aku akan memberitahukan kekurang ajaran perempuan she teng itu supaya lioksiok bisa menghajarnya
38330 hal itu kau sekali kali tidak boleh memberitahukan in lioksiok kau mengerti
38331 omongan omongan yang tidak sedap itu tidak boleh diberitahukan kepada siapapun juga
38332 siang toako apa kau kuatir tuduhan teng bin koen suatu kenyataan
38333 sesudah belasan tahun cia soen menghilang tapi karena gara garanya orang orang rimba persilatan masih terus mengorbankan jiwa hai sampai kapan urusan ini baru menjadi beres
38334 ouw soe peh berdiam di tempat yang sepi tapi mengapa aku bertemu dengan jalanan raya
38335 bangsat kau sungguh tidak tahu adat lekas berlutut dihadapan tayjin
38336 tempat ini dinamakan ouw tiap kok atau selat kupu kupu
38337 urusan cioe coe ong aku sudah tahu itulah nasib mungkin sekali rejeki tatcoe masih belum habis dan agama kita belum sampai waktunya untuk bisa memperoleh kemakmuran
38338 kau kena pukulan ciat sim ciang dari hoan ceng pada hakekatnya pukulan itu tidak sukar di obati tapi sesudah terpukul kau menggunakan terlalu banyak tenaga sehingga hawa dingin menyerang jantungmu dan sebagai akibatnya aku memerlukan agak lebih banyak tempo untuk menyembuhkannya
38339 gie coen tujuh delapan tahun kita tidak pernah bertemu muka sekali bertemu kau coba memperdayai soepehmu sudahlah aku tidak bisa mengobati lukamu pergi
38340 mana berani aku mendustai kau dengan sesungguhnya sepanjang malam aku tidak pernah bertempur dengan siapapun jua tenagaku sudah habis semua andaikata aku ingin akupun tidak bisa berkelahi
38341 terang terang hoan tiauw hiat di kedua pahamu telah ditotok orang dan totokan itu dilakukan dengan ilmu menotok dari boe tong pay tempo nya yalah antara coe sie dan tio sie
38342 ah kalau begitu yang dimaksudkan soepeh ialah jalanan darah yang ditotok olehku sendiri
38343 pheng eng giok hweeshio adalah seorang gagah sejati dari agama kita biarpun kita tidak segolongan dengan dia tapi kita harus mengaku bahwa dia itu seorang manusia yang jarang terdapat dalam dunia ini kalau begitu ditusuk ia bisa segera datang kepadaku mungkin sekali mata kanannya tidak sampai menjadi buta tapi sekarang sudah tidak dapat diobati lagi
38344 dari mana kau belajar ilmu tiam toat boe tong pay
38345 saudara kecil itu adalah putera thio ngohiap dari boe tong pay
38346 sesudah menanggung budi yang begitu besar teecoe memohon supaya soepeh suka membuat kecualian dan sudilah soepeh menolong jiwa saudara kecil ini
38347 gie coen kau sungguh seorang yang royal dengan janji janjimu
38348 hem yang ditolong thio sam hong adalah kau bukan aku lagi kapan aku pernah membuat kecualian dalam kebiasaanku
38349 ayah saudara kecil itu adalah seorang laki laki sejati yang lebih suka menggorok leher dari pada menjual sahabat dia sendiri meskipun masih kecil mempunyai jiwa seorang kesatria teeeoe menjamin bahwa dia seorang baik
38350 ada berapa banyak orang baik dalam dunia kalau dia bukan murid boe tong pay masih tidak apa dia murid sebuah partai yang lurus bersih mengapa dia harus meminta pertolongan dari agama sesat
38351 ibu saudara thio ini adalah puteri peh bie eng ong in kauwcoe
38352 dengan demikian dapatlah dikatakan separuh badannya adalah dari agama kita
38353 dia putera in so so dari peh bie kauw kalau begitu lain urusan
38354 anak aku selamanya mentaati peraturan bahwa aku tidak akan menolong orang orang dari partai lurus bersih ibumu adalah anggauta dari agama kita tapi sebelum mengobati aku ingin kau berjanji bahwa sesudah sembuh kau harus pulang ke tempat kakekmu yaitu peh bie eng ong ln kauwcoe dan kau harus masuk kedalam agama peh bie kauw dengan lain perkataan kau harus meninggalkan partai boe tong pay
38355 soepeh hal itu tidak bisa kejadian sebelum menyerahkan saudara thio kepada teecoe thio sam hong thio cinjin sudah mengatakan terang terangan bahwa kita tidak boleh memaksa dia masuk kedalam agama kita dan juga andaikata dia sembuh boe tong pay tidak menanggung budi dari agama kita
38356 dia begitu memandang rendah kepada kita perlu apa kau membantu dia anak bagaimana keputusanmu sendiri
38357 ouw sinshe ibuku ialah hio coe dari peh bie kauw dan aku pribadi menganggap bahwa peb bie kauw adalah agama baik akan tetapi sebab thay soehoe melarang aku masuk kedalam mo kauw dan aku sendiri sudah menyanggupi maka sebagai laki laki tak dapat aku menarik pulang janjiku itu jika kau tak sudi mengobati aku akupun tidak bisa berbuat apa apa kalau lantaran takut mati aku menurut apa yang diminta olehmu maka aku akan menjadi seorang manusia yang tidak mempunyai kepercayaan dan dari pada jadi manusia semacam itu lebih baik aku berpulang ke alam baka
38358 bawa dia pergi di dalam rumah ouw ceng goe tidak boleh ada orang mati lantaran sakit
38359 biarpun mo kauw agak berbeda dengan partai partai yang lurus bersih akan tetapi semenjak jaman kerajaan tong sampai sekarang dalam kalangan kami setiap turunan selalu muncul orang gagah sejati apa pula kakek luarmu adalah kauwcoe dari peh bie kauw sedang ibumu sendiri hio coe dari agama tersebut saudara kecil luluskanlah permintaan ouw soepeh di hari kemudian aku akan bertanggung jawab di hadapan thio cinjin
38360 siang toako ketuklah tulang punggungku yang ke delapan dan ke tiga belas dengan kuku jarimu ketuklah beberapa kali
38361 siang toako kau telah berbuat apa yang kau bisa di belakang hari thay soehoe tak bisa menyesalkan kau
38362 kalau aku mati di ouw tiap kok bukankah nama tiap kok ie sian akan menjadi rusak
38363 nama kian sie poet kioe ouw ceng goe sudah kesohor di kolong langit
38364 bukan baru satu orang yang roboh binasa di luar rumahnya
38365 apa kau tidak tahu bahwa aku bergelar kian sie poet kioe
38366 tapi apakah soepeh bersedia untuk mengobati luka di dalam tubuhku
38367 teecoe telah berjanji kepada thio cinjin nntuk menolong saudara kecil ini sesudah memberi janji itu tee coe tak mau orang orang partai sana mengatakan bahwa murid murid mo kauw tidak boleh dipercaya maka itu begini saja teecoe tak usah di obati oleh soepeh tapi teecoe memohon supaya soepeh sudi mengobati saudara kecil dengan demikian satu ditukar dengan satu dan soepeh tidak jadi rugi
38368 sesudah kena pukulan itu jika di dalam tempo tujuh hari kau mendapat pertolongan seorang tabib kelas satu maka lukamu akan menjadi sembuh sesudah lewat tujuh hari hanya jiwamu yang dapat ditolong sedang ilmu silatmu akan musnah seanteronya sesudah lewat empat belas hari tak satu tabibpun yang akan bisa menolong jiwamu
38369 ya itulah karena meskipun melihat kebinasaan soepeh tidak sudi menolong
38370 siang toako apa kah kau rasa boe kie manusia rendah kau menukar jiwamu dengan jiwaku andaikan aku hidup aku akan hidup menderita tak bisa ada kejadian begitu
38371 kau sungguh seperti kerbau tolol kau lebih rendah daripada binatang aku sedih bahwa di dalam mo kauw terdapat manusia yang tidak bersifat manusia dan kau masih begitu tak mengenal malu kau masih ada muka untuk membujuk aku masuk ke dalam agamamu entah dosa apa yang ditumpuk oleh delapan belas leluhurmu sehingga pada akhirnya mereka mendapat turunan seperti kau manusia yang lebih rendah dari pada anjing dan babi
38372 ouw soepeh saudara thio selamat tinggal aku sekarang ingin mencari tabib
38373 di seluruh propinsi an hoei tidak terdapat tabib yang pandai
38374 dan di dalam tujuh hari belum tentu kau bisa keluar dari propinsi ini
38375 dan kau mempunyai soetit keponakan murid yang tidak mengenal mampus
38376 kalau kau tidak mengobati siang toako satu hari kau pasti akan binasa di dalam tanganku aku aku
38377 kalau kau tidak mengobati siang toako satu hari kau pasti akan binasa di dalam tanganku
38378 biarlah kedua duanya tidak ditolong olehku perduli apa jika di ouw tiap kok bertambah dengan dua setan penasaran
38379 apakah bocah sekecil dia sudah bisa membuka kie keng pat meh
38380 puluhan tahun aku berlatih tapi belum dapat aku membuka pembuluh darahku oh aku tahu tak salah lagi inilah akibat bantuan thio sam hong dia rupanya sangat sayang bocah ini dan rela mengorbankan sebagian lweekangnya
38381 thio sam hong berlagak pintar tapi dia jadi bodoh lantaran menyayang dia mencelakakan cucu muridnya jikalau kie keng pat meh anak ini belum terbuka jiwanya masih dapat ditolong tapi sekarang racun dingin sudah buyar dan masuk ke dalam isi perutnya kecuali dewa manusia biasa tak berdaya lagi huh huh kata orang boe tong thio sam hong berkepandaian luar biasa tinggi tapi menurut penglihatanku dia goblok berlapis dungu
38382 baiklah lebih dulu aku akan menyembuhkan penyakitnya aku pasti bisa menyembuhkannya sesudah dia sembuh masih banyak tempo untuk membinasakannya
38383 gelar tiap kok ie sian untukku sebenarnya kurang tepat dan aku tidak menyuka julukan itu gelar kian sie poet kioe barulah menyenangkan hatiku
38384 tay meh dalam tubuh manusia merupakan pembuluh darah yang paling aneh
38385 ouw sinshe apa kau tahu bahwa ada beberapa orang yang tidak mempunyai tay meh
38386 ouw sinshe dunia ini luas sekali dan di dalam dunia terdapat banyak yang aneh aneh apalagi menurut katanya orang tay meh sebenarnya tidak memegang peranan penting dalam tubuh manusia
38387 aku mengakui bahwa tay meh adalah pembuluh darah yang agak aneh
38388 tapi dusta besar jika orang mengatakan babwa tay meh tidak berguna besar dalam dunia terdapat banyak tabib tolol yang tidak mengerti kegunaan dan pentingnya tay meh aku mempunyai sejilid kitab tay meh kau bacalah sendiri
38389 dua belas keng siang meh dan kie keng cit meh semua mengalir dari atas ke bawah hanya tay meh yang terletak di samping kempungan mengalir dengan memutari pinggang seperti juga sehelai ikatan pinggang dalam beberapa kitab pengobatan terdapat keterangan bahwa tay meh mempunyai empat hiat atau enam hiat itu semua salah tay meh sebenarnya mempunyai sepuluh hiat dua di antaranya kadang kadang muncul kadang kadang menghilang sehingga sukar sekali dapat diraba
38390 kau mengatakan bahwa thio sam hong menulis buku itu waktu ia berusia tiga puluh tahun dan karena ia sekarang sudah berumur seratus tahun lebih maka ia menulis itu pada tujuhpuluh tahun berselang dengan lain perkataan lagi akulah yang sudah mencuri buah kalamnya thio sam hong kurang ajar kitab tay meh itu adalah hasil jerih payahku dan belum pernah didapat oleh siapapun dua dalam dunia ini kurang ajar kau mengatakan coe hak tay meh jip boen cian swee sudah coe hak jip boen sudah jip boen cian swee lagi kunyuk kecil ini benar benar kurang ajar
38391 kalau kau tidak percaya biarlah aku menghafal coe hak tay meh jip boen cian swee itu yang digubah oleh thay soehoe
38392 kalau salah sehuruf saja tahu sendiri aku akan segera mengambil jiwamu
38393 duabelas keng siang meh dan kie keng cit meh semua mengalir dari atas ke bawah
38394 anak itu mempunyai bakat kwee bak poet bong manusia yang seperti dia sukar dicari keduanya di dalam dunia
38395 di samping kitab tay meh aku memiliki kitab coe ngo ciam cie keng
38396 coba kau lihat apakah thio sim hong juga sudah pernah menggubah kitab yang seperti itu
38397 untuk membaca dua belas jilid sedikitnya memerlukan tempo tiga atau empat hari
38398 bagaimana aku dapat menghafal dalam tempo cepat biarlah aku coba saja mencari ilmu untuk mengobati luka siang toako
38399 turun tangan mulai dari cie kiong hiat tiong tseg hiat koan goan hiat dan thian tie hiat sesudah itu memberi obat dengan melihat perubahan im yang dan ngoheng meninjau lima hawa udara yaitu dingin panas kering basah dan angin dan memperlihatkan lima perasaan girang gusar jengkel banyak pikiran dan bersemangat dari si sakit
38400 yang paling penting yalah coba menolong siang toako aku tidak boleh mengejek tabib malaikat ini
38401 dalam ilmu silat ouw sinshe tidak dapat menandingi tay soehoe tetapi di dalam ilmu ketabiban tay soe hoe tidak bisa melawan ouw sinshe
38402 coe ngo ciam cie keng luas dan dalam tay soehoe tak akan dapat menggubah kitab seperti itu akan tetapi mengenai pengobatan pukulan telapak tangan apa yang dipelajari ouw sinshe belum dapat melampaui pelajaran tay soehoe
38403 luka boanpwee akibat pukulan hian beng sin ciang tak dapat diobati oleh tay soehoe mungkin sekali ouw sinshepun tidak berdaya
38404 kau saksikan saja sendiri apa benar aku tidak berdaya tapi sesudah aku menyembuhkan kau belum tentu kau bisa hidup lama
38405 ouw sinshe jika boanpwee tidak bisa hidup lama boanpwee ingin sekali bisa membaca lagi kitab coe ngo ciam cie keng yang sangat luar biasa itu
38406 bahwa aku siang gie coen telah mendapat penghargaan yang begitu tinggi dari thio cinjin bukan main rasa terima kasihku akan tetapi sesudah menjadi anggauta beng kauw seumur hidup aku tak berani membelakangi agamaku itu
38407 setiap hari kau harus makan kenyang kenyang supaya loo too ya jangan jengkel
38408 terima kasih untuk kebaikanmu tapi aku hanya bisa makan nasi beberapa hari saja
38409 aku mendoakan supaya di belakang hari kau jalan di jalanan yang lurus
38410 kau memiliki lweekang dan kepandaian yang sangat tinggi biarpun luka saudara kecil itu sangat berat aku percaya kau akan dapat menyembuhkannya
38411 aku sendiri telah mendapat luka yang sangat berat dan sekarang aku justeru ingin meminta pertolongan dari seorang tabib malaikat mengapa thio cinjin tidak mau mencoba coba
38412 semua pembuluh darahnya telah terbuka sehingga racun dingin bisa membuyar dan masuk ke dalam perutnya
38413 ia tidak akan dapat disembuhkan dengan memakai obat biasa dan di dalam dunia tak seorangpun bisa mengobatinya
38414 tabib malaikat yang dimaksudkan olehku memiliki kepandaian luar biasa tinggi sehingga kata orang ia malah mampu menghidupkan mayat
38415 aku lebih suka boe kie mati dari pada menyerahkannya kepada orang dari agama sesat itu
38416 thio cinjin meskipun ouw soepeh biasanya menolak untuk mengobati orang luar tapi karena thio cinjin telah menolong jiwa cioe kouw nio ia pasti akan membuat kecualian andaikata ia menolak gie coen pasti tak mau mengerti
38417 mengapa kau begitu bersangsi kalau diobati oleh soepehku paling banyak saudara kecil itu tidak sembuh kalau ke kiri mati ke kanan pun mati perlu apa tootiang memikir panjang
38418 menurut penglihatanku paling banyak boe kie bisa bertahan dalam tempo sebulan lagi
38419 gie coen baiklah aku minta pertolonganmu akan tetapi sebelum pertolongan diberikan aku ingin menjelaskan terlebih dulu bahwa sinshe tidak boleh membujuk atau memaksa boe kie masuk k edalam agama kalian di samping itu jika boe kie benar menjadi sembuh boe tong pay tidak menanggung budi agama kalian
38420 dengan berkata begitu kau jadi memandang terlalu rendah kepada orang orang kami
38421 cioe kauwnio aku ingin kau mengikut thio cinjin untuk sementara waktu apa kau suka
38422 aku tahu bahwa thio cinjin tidak suka pergi kepada ouw soepehku
38423 dapat dimengerti bahwa lurus dan sesat tidak bisa berdiri berendeng thio cinjin adalah seorang guru besar pada jaman ini cara bagaimana thio cinjin bisa meminta pertolongan dari seorang anggauta agama sesat di samping itu adat ouw soepeh juga aneh sekali jika ia bertemu dengan thio cinjin mungkin sekali ia tidak berlaku sopan santun sehingga pertemuan itu bisa berakibat sebaliknya daripada apa yang diharap maka itu menurut pendapatku sebaiknya saudara thio dibawa olehku sendiri tapi akupun mengerti bahwa thio cinjin merasa sangsi untuk menyerahkan saudara thio kepadaku maka itulah aku minta cioe kouwnio berdiam di boe tong san untuk sementara waktu nanti sesudah saudara thio sembuh aku akan mengantarkannya ke boe tong san dan sekalian mengambil pulang cioe kouwnio dengan perkataan yang lebih tegas aku ingin minta cioe kauwnio mengikut thio cinjin untuk dijadikan semacam tanggungan
38424 cioe cie ong cioe toako adalah seorang yang bener benar luhur pribudinya
38425 gie coen baiklah aku akan merawat cioe kauwnio baik baik dan kaupun harus merawat boe kie sebaik baiknya sesudah anak itu sembuh kuharap kau lekas lekas datang di boe tong san
38426 sesudah kau sembuh siang toako akan membawa kau pulang ke boe tong kita hanya berpisahan untuk beberapa bulan dan kau tak perlu bersusah hati
38427 nona kecil itu sangat cantik dan di hari kemudian ia pasti akan menjadi seorang wanita yang ayu luar biasa
38428 sesudah boe kie sembuh aku tidak boleh membiarkan mereka bertemu muka lagi jika mereka sampai saling menyinta hikayat coei san mungkin akan terulang lagi
38429 usia dua belas tahun bukan anak anak lagi apa kau tak malu menangis waktu aku berusia duabelas tahun aku sudah menerima pukulan ratusan kali tapi tidak setetes air mata keluar dari mataku seorang laki laki sejati hanya boleh mengucurkan darah tak boleh mengucurkan air mata kalau kau terus menangis seperti bayi aku akan hajar kau
38430 aku menangis karena merasa sedih harus berpisahan dengan thay soehoe aku belum pernah menangis sebab pukulan mau pukul boleh kau pukul kalau hari ini kau memukul aku satu kali di hari kemudian nanti aku akan membalas sepuluh kali
38431 itulah perkataan seorang laki laki kau begitu lihai tak berani aku memukul kau
38432 kalau hari ini aku memukul kau di kemudian hari sesudah kau memiliki kepandaian tinggi bagaimana aku kuat menerima sepuluh kali pukulanmu
38433 menurut kebiasaan sekali lari aku bisa melalui seratus li apakah pukulan kedua pendeta bangsat itu sedemikian hebat sehingga aku tidak dapat berjalan lagi
38434 si toosoe orang koen loan pay lihatlah pukulan tay mo hoei soe tay mo hoe see artinya pasir beterbangan di gurun pasir itu sungguh amat hebat itulah pukulan simpanan dari koen loen pay tapi siapakah lelaki yang menggunakan ilmu silat tee tong to hoat
38435 dalam tee tong to hoat khong thong pay orang halus menggunakan sebatang golok yang dicekal di tangan karan dan sebatang toya di tangan kiri orang itu menggunakan sepasang golok
38436 kami bukan maui jiwamu perlu apa kau nekad nekadan serahkan pek kwie sioe dan kita akan berpisahan sebagai sahabat
38437 pak tancoe sudah dilukakan berat oleh kamu jangankan aku dan dia masih sama sama orang orang segolongan terhadap orang luar sekalipun aku tak bisa mengawasi kebinasaan dengan berpeluk tangan
38438 mengawasi kebinasaan dengan berpeluk tangan kau tahu tujuan kami bukan mengnendaki jiwanya kami hanya menyelidiki tempat bersembunyinya seorang
38439 kalau kamu mau menyelidiki di mana adanya cia soen mengapa kamu tidak mau pergi kepada hong thio siauw lim sie
38440 apa kau tidak tahu bahwa itu hanya tipu busuk dari perempuan siluman in so so
38441 lututnya sudah kena sia wie kauw gaetan buntut kalajengking semacam senjata rahasia
38442 kau akan bisa bertahan selama setengah jam tapi dengan demikian kau akan merusak tenaga dalammu
38443 untuk menolong jiwa manusia aku rela merusak tenaga dalamku sendiri
38444 ya benar di situ ke sebelah dikit setengah coan bagus nah sekarang totoklah
38445 inilah ilmu yang dinamakan tie sin tah hiat hoat ilmu menotok jalan darah untuk mempertinggi semangat
38446 celaka kau tidak mengerti tiam hiat mungkin sekali kau salah dalam menggunakan tenaga tunggulah sebentar
38447 kouw soetee cobalah kau menimpuk lagi dengan dua buah golok terbangmu untuk mencoba coba
38448 sekarang sukar diselidiki di mana dia menyembunyikan pek kwie sioe
38449 karena merasa kasihan terhadap orang perempuan aku tidak berlalu kejam terhadap kamu tapi tidak dinyana rasa kasihanku berbalik mencelakakan diriku sendiri
38450 pheng hweeshio tidak berlaku kejam terhadap kita dan kitapun tidak boleh membunuh dia
38451 aku hanya ingin memaksa supaya dia memberitahukan tempat sembunyinya pek kwie sioe
38452 dia telah keracunan hebat paling dulu kita harus memunahkan racun itu
38453 saudara see leng berikanlah obat pemunah sie wie kauw kepadaku
38454 soe moyku berhati murah dan sudah menotong jiwamu sekarang beritahukanlah di mana adanya pek kwie sioe
38455 dengan berkata begitu kau memandang aku terlalu rendah thio ngohiap dari boe tong pay lebih suka bunuh diri daripada memberitahukan tempat tinggal saudara angkatnya pribadi thio ngohiap yang luhur itu dikagumi sungguh oleh pheng eng giok maka itu biarpun aku bukan seorang ternama aku ingin mengikut perbuatan thio ngohiap
38456 dengan menikahi dengan perempuan siluman thio coei san seperti juga sudah buta matanya
38457 kemudian kutikam mata kirimu sesudah itu kusodok kuping kanan dan kuping kirimu dan akhirnya ku papas hidungmu tapi kau tak usah kuatir biar bagaimanapun juga aku tak akan mengambil jiwamu
38458 sudah lama kudengar bahwa biat coat soethay dari go bie pay seorang kejam sekarang aku mendapat kenyataan bahwa si murid tidak banyak berbeda dengan sang guru hari ini pheng eng giok sudah jatuh kedalam tanganmu dan kau boleh berbuat sesukamu
38459 aku sungguh tak mengerti akan sikapmu kau bukan anggauta peh bie kauw tapi mengapa kau rela membuang jiwamu untuk manusia seperti pek kwie sioe
38460 biarpun aku menerangkan kepadamu tentang cara caranya seorang kesatria kau tentu tak akan mengerti
38461 soecie dia keras kepala dan biar bagaimanapun jua ia pasti tidak akan membuka mulut
38462 dia mencaci soehoe sebagai seorang kejam maka biarlah dia menyaksikan kekejamanku
38463 siluman mo kauw semacam dia hanya bisa mencelakakan manusia baik baik maka itu jikalau kita menyingkirkannya dari muka bumi ini berarti kita berbuat baik terhadap sesama manusia
38464 tapi tidak bisa disangkal bahwa dia seorang gagah yang tidak takut mati
38465 dua soeheng dari siauw lim pay yang satu binasa satu terluka sedang dua tootiang dari koen loen pay mendapat luka berat sedang dua saudara dari hay see pay terluka lebih hebat juga apa tangannya tidak cukup kejam sekarang biarlah aku menusuk mata kirinya sesudah itu baru kita menanyakan lagi tempat sembunyinya pek kwie sioe
38466 dia sudah tidak bisa melawan lagi dan jika kita menganiaya dia aku kuatir partai kita makin mendapat nama jelek dalam rimba persilatan
38467 kalau kau menganggap aku sebagai kakak seperguruan kau harus mendengar omonganku
38468 beberapa kali dengan mati matian kau melindungi pendeta siluman itu apa sebenarnya maksudmu
38469 jikalau kita ingin menyelidiki di mana tempat sembunyinya pek kwie sioe kita hanya bisa menanyakan nanti secara perlahan lahan
38470 berapa kali in liokhiap dari boe tong pay mendesak supaya kau menikah dengannya mengapa kau selalu menolak dengan memberikan rupa rupa alasan waktu ayahmu turut mendesak mengapa kau kabur dari rumahmu
38471 di hadapan orang luar memang kurang baik jika aku membuka topengmu huh badanmu berada di go bie tapi hatimu di pihak mo kauw
38472 aku selalu menghormati kau sebagai seorang kakak dan belum pernah aku berbuat kesalahan terhadapmu
38473 kalau benar benar hatimu tidak condong kepada mo kauw coba tusaklah mata kiri pendeta siluman itu
38474 sebagaimana kau tahu semenjak jaman siauw ong sia kwee soecouw kwee siang di dalam partai kita terdapat banyak sekali wanita yang tidak mau menikah seumur hidupnya oleh karena mengagumi kemuliaan mendiang guru besar kita siauwmoaypun telah mengambil keputusan untuk tidak menikah siauwmoay menganggap hal itu hal yang lumrah saja mengapa soecie mendesak begitu hebat
38475 jika kau tidak mau menikam mata pendeta siluman itu aku akan mencopoti topengmu
38476 aku memohon kepadamu soecie dengan mengingat kecintaan antara sesama saudara sepenguruan janganlah kau mendesak aku terlalu hebat
38477 sebagaimana kau tahu soehoe telah memerintahkan kita untuk menyelidiki tempat bersembunyinya kim mo say ong cie soen sekarang pendeta itu adalah orang satu satunya yang bisa memberi penerangan kepada kita tapi dia bukan saja sungkan membantu kita malah sudah melukai juga kawan kawan kita kalau aku menikam mata kanannya dan kau menikam mata kirinya bukankah merupakan suatu hal yang sangat wajar mengapa kau merasa segan tidak mau turun tangan
38478 soehoe sering memuji kau sebagai murid yang ilmu pedangnya hebat dan adatnya keras sangat menyerupai adat soehoe sehingga beliau mempunyai niatan untuk mengangkat kau sebagai ahli warisnya mana boleh hatimu lembek
38479 pada tiga tahun berselang soehoe telah mengumpulkan semua murid di puncak kim teng d ipuncak gunung go bie san dengan maksud untuk mengajar ilmu pedang bit kiam dan coat kiam kepada semua saudara sepenguruan kita coba jawab kenapa kau tidak hadir dalam pertemuan besar itu mengapa beliau jadi begitu gusar sehingga beliau mematahkan pedangnya sendiri dan mengatakan bahwa dunia tidak akan mengenal lagi kedua ilmu pedang itu
38480 ketika itu siauwmoay tiba tiba mendapat sakit berat di kam cioe sehingga tak bisa bangun
38481 hal ini siauwmoay sudah memberitahukan kepada soehoe mengapa soecie menanyakan pedang itu
38482 kau bisa memperdayai soehoe tapi tak dapat mengabui aku aku masih ingin mengajukan sebuah pertanyaan tapi jika kau menikam mata si kepala gundul pertanyaan itu tidak diajukan olehku
38483 apakah kau tidak ingat iagi kecintaan antara sesama saudara sepenguruan
38484 andaikata aku mau di jadikan ahliwaris oleh soehoe aku tentu akan menolak
38485 dengan berkata begitu kau seperti juga mau mengatakan bahwa aku menerima budimu yang besar cobalah kau unjuk di bagian mana yang aku kalah dari kau aku tidak perlu menerima budimu tidak perlu kau mengalah eh katakan sekarang kau mau tikam atau tidak
38486 jika siauwmoay bersalah soecie boleh menegur atau menjatuhkan hukuman dan siauwmoay akan menerimanya dengan segala senang hati
38487 di sini terdapat sahabat sahabat dari lain partai sehingga kumohon soecie jangan mendesak terlalu
38488 huh jangan kau berlagak sedih sedang di dalam hati kau mencaci aku
38489 pada tiga tahun yang lalu apa benar benar kau mendapat sakit di lam cioe perkataan dapat memang tak salah tapi bukan mendapat sakit hanya mendapat anak
38490 soemoay lebih baik kau tikam mata kiri pendeta siluman itu
38491 jika kau tetap membantah aku akan menanya siapa adanya ayah anak itu dan aku akan menanya mengapa sebagai murid dari sebuah partai yang lurus bersih kau melindungi seorang pendeta siluman dari agama mokauw secara begitu mati matian
38492 jawab pertanyaanku di mana kau titip bayimu kau adalah tunangan in lie heng in liokhiap tapi mengapa kau melahirkan anak
38493 jikalau kau mendesak terus aku terpaksa akan berlaku kurang ajar

38506 comments like a smart girl like you should have gone to medical school well that just sends me into orbit because i personally wouldnt want to be taken care of by a dumb nurse
38507 you want the people who take care of you to be as smart as you can possibly get

38543 he died when i was 18 and when i sing it always sort of feels like thats my way of talking to my dad i also usually wear either his army dog tags or his glasses when we play cause he always wanted to be a singer so its my way of taking him up on stage with me

38551 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
38552 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
38553 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
38554 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
38555 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
38556 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices

38561 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
38562 i think it is highly unlikely that they would raise rates under these conditions and given what they are trying to accomplish with these facilities
38563 todays announcement does not prevent tightening under all circumstances but it does indicate that the inflation threat has to be substantial enough to overcome a still questionable outlook for growth
38564 these facilities would be withdrawn should the board determine that conditions in financial markets are no longer unusual and exigent
38565 its very difficult to see how the fed can raise rates while a declaration of
38566 thus we continue to expect monetary policy to remain on hold for the foreseeable future
38567 if you think youre going to have a bad day and be sad or you think youre in for a happy day trust these thoughts as your intuition is likely to be right

38569 people are just as happy as they make up their minds to be
38570 the good news is that a great life is available to each and every one of us living well and making a difference do not require money fame or power living well is about taking time to live your own life on your own terms its about caring and sharing about loving and dancing and sharing a meal with a friend or with a stranger life is short give it your very best every day
38571 its a shame whats happened because more people care about special interests than peoples interests
38572 we should be the most progressive state in the south but we havent put our money where we should
38573 we ought to make our state clean and literate instead of illiterate
38574 in some parishes 50 percent of kids live in poverty
38575 it takes sound financial planning with a good purpose and making sure the money is spent well
38576 im sorry for our fans but we do not have the capital needed to meet our commitments and we are forced to mortgage all our heritage like our most important players
38577 whoever we play is fine and you can study the opposition but you cant tell who will be on form at the start
38578 the new boys have brought enthusiasm and we know that they were key players for their former sides who won their respective leagues
38579 three could arrive it is not said that these three are linked to who will leave
38580 last year we surprised everyone but now the expectations are different because the fans want the team to go even further
38581 the main thing is to consolidate the good things we did last year but i wont deny that we want to be fighting for a place in europe
38582 its hilarious that youre distraught it must be a sign of poor leadership
38583 here is a man publicly distraught over the lost lives a man who understands that the foundation of true leadership is empathy a man who cares and is in touch with the effects of this disaster

38587 the senators and representatives shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
38588 the united states is not a christian state or even a generically religious state

38599 people were distressed at some of the reactions to some of the things that were said
38600 there were occasions when bishops actually booed and hissed what other bishops said in the gathering
38601 same degree of difference in the views held by the bishops but at the end of the indaba group bishops from different ends of the spectrum on the issues actually embraced each other and thanked each other for helping them understand better what was at stake in these issues
38602 now we havent waved a magic wand and gotten answers but i think that is a very significant step forward
38603 about how we engaged sensitively with each other in our different readings of scripture and our pastoral approaches to people with gay and lesbian lifestyles
38604 the marginalized of the most marginalized are welcome in the kingdom of god
38605 we need to look at what we believe about human nature human relationships and about god gods nature and gods relationship with us
38606 and we need dispassion not in the sense of being cold and analytical about it but actually trying to see the question whole not letting our emotions our prejudices immediately dictate not only a conclusion but also an attitude towards other people
38607 we have expressed our convictions clearly but with generosity and with respect of the other and we have listened carefully attentively to the challenges of our bishops living in other contexts
38608 a bishop from the episcopal church stood up and spoke about his own context and then we held hands and said weve got to journey together
38609 the whole scope of human sexuality has got to be enlarged
38610 in the process that has been given to us we are able to look at one another
38611 past holding one another at bay moving toward relationship with one another and doing mission work with one another
38612 there were apologies back and forth for things that have been said and done in the past and i think we moved forward in a sense of abundance rather than a sense of meagerness
38613 anxious that there wont be a definitive decision made at this conference
38614 the healing of the communion and whatever that takes i think we have to be patient with this
38615 i tend to trust the process that the windsor report has laid out for us as the road map for reconciliation
38616 be more concerned with your character than your reputation because your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are
38617 lets plunge ourselves into the roar of time the whirl of accident may pain and pleasure success and failure shift as they will its only action that can make a man
38618 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to those people who are actually in the arena who know the great enthusiasms the great devotions to a worthy cause who at best know the triumph of high achievement and who at worst fail while daring greatly so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
38619 el reino de dios se parece a un grupo de gente que comparte lo que tiene

38621 a beating heart is the core of what we are going to be doing in the next several years with open source and linux
38622 number one are our products likely to be open sourced no
38623 we do provide our source code in special situations but open source also implies free free is inconsistent with paying for lunches at the partner conference applause with that said there are a number of different things will we interoperate with products that come from like linux from the open source world yes we will
38624 microsoft wants people to build code to the windows platform rather than gnu linux but the fsfs view is to build an ecosystem with free software
38625 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero

38640 maybe the fact that there were very few clubs that were able to get things done thursday means over the next few weeks there will be some interesting moves
38641 we will certainly be watching the waiver wire everyday and looking to improve the club
38642 our position a week from now is going to be what it is today unless theyre going to step up and give us the prospect package we want
38643 you can still make moves after aug 1 with certain restrictions but we also have the offseason
38644 there is a lot of time to make moves we are not in any time crunch there is no deadline to get this club turned around in the next two days the next week or the next two or three weeks we have time to do this and we plan to do it systematically step by step
38645 this just came together and were not good enough to make a corresponding move yet
38646 its not like our players arent going to get through waivers
38647 what could be wrong peace and love what a great birthday gift its a happening
38648 i feel about 68 the same as i felt about 28 its another birthday i love birthdays i love gifts
38649 its not just fun its humbling to play alongside a beatle i stand in awe of the beatles what they did transcended music they brought about a whole revolution without firing a shot
38650 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
38651 hej david jag har m rkt att du har funderat p att g ra dig av med mig
38652 du f rst r de p kunskapsskolan verkar vara sjyssta jag beh ver inte sl ss n mer
38653 du l ter som om du tror att jag bara r en gammal m glig strumpa du kan kasta bort

38657 men de jag har i min klass kan inte vara det
38658 utan mig hade du inte verlevt ngskolan t nker du d p grund av n gon ogrundad lojalitetk nsla
38659 det h r ser ju ut att bli en bra dag
38660 you dont choose we fight to win everything like both lippi and trap did
38661 certainly this is my goal to become like them lippi and trappatoni or else i would not have accepted the juventus job
38662 they are two different competitions but less different than before once it was said that in serie a you can correct one or two errors while in champions league this isnt possible but now im convinced one mistake in either competition could be fatal
38663 were at 500 but all of a sudden weve added a difference maker
38664 but id be mad if he wasnt coming at all
38665 day in and day out its his consistency that you appreciate when you see him
38666 hes the greatest right handed hitter ive ever seen a real pro
38667 hes an outstanding teammate as good as any and i can honestly say that when you see him every day and appreciate what he does its amazing to compare with his reputation and what he really is like its almost night and day
38668 the last thing you want is to get manny and think that now weve won
38669 we cant say we dont have to keep playing the way weve been playing lately we cant think hes going to win every game by himself hell go 0 for 4 of course there will be a lot of games hell win single handedly
38670 i told ozzie when he was walking in that they got griffey so we signed barry bonds
38671 you tip your cap to them well see what that does to their club we still have 55 games to go
38672 i dont know what they are going to do with him how hes going to fit but they have a plan we just need to get them out no matter who is in the lineup
38673 it gives them another bat it adds a big name
38674 im sure it will be a little bit of a boost for them you cant really worry too much about what the white sox are doing we just have to worry about what were doing to catch them
38675 we felt very strong about moss ability to come out and be an everyday outfielder for us
38676 you get stuck behind manny ramirez and j d drew and youre not going to get many at bats he continued to work hard theres a nice quality package there
38677 its something that john and i have to talk about moving forward
38678 well have to figure out exactly how that mix goes
38679 truth of the matter is that neil has put himself in a position this year with some offensive struggles that he wasnt ready to go in our minds opening day next year
38680 as we move forward were still excited about neil walkers growth and development
38681 when we have too many third baseman that have a bright future with this organization then we have a challenge well have to be creative with playing time or it allows us to move player x or player y for two other players from somewhere else
38682 some people have told me after rumors of the trade leaked out that if the upside clicks hes a closer somewhere down the road
38683 he very much has the stuff where he could pitch himself into a very meaningful role in the seventh or the eighth
38684 we continue to accumulate that depth that talent that we need to be a sustainable championship caliber organization
38685 its eight players weve added eight players with solid pedigrees solid major league upside it is something that were thrilled about as an organization
38686 the practical issues included world poverty the wars in iraq and afghanistan the situation in palestine and israel the danger of further wars and the freedom of religion
38687 we recognise that gods merciful love is infinite eternal and embraces all things this love is central to both our religions and is at the heart of the judeo christian islamic monotheistic heritage
38688 it is not just the love of god but love of neighbour also
38689 you might die but you will die sacrificing your life on behalf of others rather than killing yourself so that others may die as well
38690 denounce and deplore threats made against those who engage in interfaith dialogue
38691 if the club lazio set certain parameters and then he stankovic finds a consensus with mourinho under these conditions why not
38692 there is some indirect evidence that women have greater longevity after a marriage ends by becoming a widow or getting a divorce
38693 i had three proposals and turned them all down i knew they wouldnt work
38694 my sister said she wouldnt come unless i came down
38695 being able to be myself i didnt want to get married again i almost did a couple of times
38696 i worked hard when i worked and played hard when i played
38697 some concern for neural and behavioral effects in early stages of development
38698 these are simple changes that will make a big difference to patients at the end of their lives
38699 historically doctors have been encouraged to back away from patients when they enter hospice but this keeps familiar people involved
38700 plus its nice to have someone there who is not concerned with the hospices bottom line
38701 people are living longer and the end of life looks different than it used to
38702 the federal government wants to know what theyre paying for and everyone understands that
38703 good organizations are already doing most of these things so the effects on us will be minimal
38704 the new rules really should allow the hospices to meet the individual needs of each patient
38705 it usually will fall to the states and the individual doesnt have any way to enforce these rights
38706 will have to be very diligent about keeping up with what is going on
38707 our job is not to add stress at the end of life but to make it easy
38708 you hear about that stuff read about it in the paper i kind of avoid rock island for that reason
38709 when you have violent crime people start getting involved and that helps address the overall crime rate
38710 i honestly think its not worth it to rob people anymore no one has anything
38711 theres a lot of community activity and people trying to stop crime and i think if enough people report it and tell whats going on the better it is for the city
38712 i think i might start coming back down to the area and hanging out
38713 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
38714 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
38715 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
38716 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
38717 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
38718 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
38719 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
38720 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
38721 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
38722 effectively the department is saying that a primary care trust should be able to say to a dentist your contract will come to an end tomorrow just because we feel like it
38723 every right minded person can see that this is totally unreasonable and would destroy the viability of family dental practices
38724 a success for the department of health would be bad for dentists bad for patients and disastrous for the health of the nation
38725 mapofvideo provide spots on the maps which when a user clicks on they get to see videos svid on the other hand gives fantastic effects to the results when they are displayed
38726 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
38727 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
38728 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
38729 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
38730 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
38731 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
38732 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
38733 applicable only when you spend over so and so much money
38734 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
38735 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
38736 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
38737 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
38738 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
38739 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
38740 i cant prove that they werent here on the 28th
38741 i told the guy at least 20 times that i cant afford it
38742 i more or less signed the paper trying to get rid of him
38743 really do you really think well cross that bridge when we get to it i mean lets take a look at our track record i think out of any group of people we are the last ones youd want to cross a bridge with
38744 in greencastle all we can do right now is pregnancy tests or verification
38745 if they need materials want to participate in our prenatal module or get connected with a peer counselor they have to go to chambersburg or waynesboro
38746 it is exciting to see the support we have gotten from the community
38747 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
38748 i just love black people theyre such wonderful musicians and athletes
38749 theres so much crap going on at a course from monday to wednesday im just not for it anymore
38750 i just arrive at the last minute play my practice round and get the tournament under way
38751 thats the only fairway i missed i tried to hit it to the fat side of the fairway and i came off it a little bit
38752 i pulled a muscle in my stomach and that takes a long time to heal i got that worked out and then i had a few issues with my shoulder but i think ive got it all cleared away
38753 i took a lot of time off and got my body a little more rested and played well today
38754 i direct that my corpse be buried as cheaply as possible in whatever town or place i may happen to die
38755 where are the quaker values misappropriation of funds is not a quaker value
38756 a bedrock principle of well managed nonprofit organizations is to honor the intentions of your donors
38757 these other programs may be completely noble but if the donor wants it used for purpose a it cannot be used for purpose b its not good it does not help current or future supporters of the afsc to have confidence
38758 it was hard to have a social conversation with him
38759 if you had something of substance to say he would talk about it
38760 heres a man who at every point was where things were happening
38761 in china he would save lives in the morning play the violin in the afternoon and go to the chinese opera in the evening
38762 we thought we were acting in accordance with the executors wishes
38763 to replenish the fund for any expenditures that may have exceeded the purposes stated in the will
38764 when you receive restricted funds that is the only way you can use the money
38765 you cant just translate it into what your wishes are if someones dead they have no advocate the only advocate that a dead person has is the attorney generals office
38766 when we thought there might be a question about this fund we stopped and set it right
38767 integrity is very important to the quakers and we try to always act according to the highest ethical standards
38768 new school vle summer 08 online project blog more on the nonprofit commons
38769 i dont hate gays but i wouldnt like to meet one
38770 i needed to put a degree with my background training
38771 i have lots of experience and i need a degree for better job opportunities
38772 i can take classes during my lunch or during the evening times and they are good with getting me into classes when they are full
38773 they have multiple roles and may not be as campus oriented
38774 if you ask an on campus student who are they
38775 want to change careers be more marketable stay more current in their work force or to be a good role model for their children by completing something they started
38776 the owens community college honors program is designed to foster an educational environment in which students can excel to their fullest potential
38777 its important to us that they feel like full fledged members of our honors program community when they arrive in their junior year
38778 i did not expect the acceleration that were seeing in the out years
38779 whether were talking about logs generated by network or application firewalls intrusion detection systems file integrity monitor tools or the operating systems themselves ive come to the conclusion that the only people who dont hate them are the vendors who sell them
38780 due to overwhelming interest in card rewards we are currently experiencing difficulty accessing starbucks card accounts we are working to fix the problem and ask that you please try again later
38781 i did not expect the acceleration that were seeing in the out years
38782 whether were talking about logs generated by network or application firewalls intrusion detection systems file integrity monitor tools or the operating systems themselves ive come to the conclusion that the only people who dont hate them are the vendors who sell them
38783 due to overwhelming interest in card rewards we are currently experiencing difficulty accessing starbucks card accounts we are working to fix the problem and ask that you please try again later
38784 its not the top of the mountain but its not the bottom
38785 im just encouraged to have a job to go to i transpose all my notes from the training
38786 i just want to start saving half for me and half for them
38787 but i still cry sometimes because i dont know how long it will last
38788 every morning i wake up and i thank god for the day and ask him to send me a test so i can pass or fail and move on
38789 life is a test and ive had far too many exams
38790 you wouldnt think it would come to you but im only a pawn
38791 when i started i was promised to go full time
38792 they said they would expand and move but now each year they subtract more and more
38793 it probably wont affect us much until next month but im trying to get jades school clothes
38794 i do a lot of things for people no charge brake jobs handyman jobs
38795 it just makes me feel good i took down a tree for my sister last week i never charge her anything cause she takes care of my mother and she wrote me a check and we were just passing it back and forth
38796 now i have to tell people i just cant do this for free anymore
38797 they had a woman cop frisk me i was grateful for that but the cuffs were so tight it hurt
38798 i thought oh my god this is how people get raped and hurt
38799 just a little focus the cheapest car i could find everything just snowballs doctors bills dentists bills payments you lose a lot you lose your self worth and youre fearful youll never be independent
38800 everything at the shelters its single file for dinner clothes anything
38801 some girls will come in blitzed some of them will meet guys i just hope theyre not being taken advantage of
38802 people go in with no meds and they come out with 5 000 pills
38803 an alcoholic does not need a pain pill he needs withdrawal for three days
38804 are widely read by adults and younger readers and are increasingly used in schools
38805 an irrational hatred disapproval or fear of homosexuality gay and lesbian people and their culture
38806 hey you cant let these folks have that signed piece of paper giving them certain legal rights in the eyes of the state this one book has a handful of vague passages suggesting that it might be uncool
38807 week but like my strange attraction to ron at the beach what is the whoop with beer pong
38808 although we understand that 21 is the legal drinking age we dont want our students participating in activities that could do excessive harm to themselves or others
38809 effectively the department is saying that a primary care trust should be able to say to a dentist your contract will come to an end tomorrow just because we feel like it
38810 every right minded person can see that this is totally unreasonable and would destroy the viability of family dental practices
38811 a success for the department of health would be bad for dentists bad for patients and disastrous for the health of the nation
38812 in my opinion weve complied with the contract done everything we said wed do and we still intend to build the hotel
38813 she certainly didnt show she could be counted on to take care of her job here at home
38814 so im quite surprised and actually upset that shed find another home in the public sector especially in homeland security
38815 the series was up 31 percent among adults 18 49 2 146 vs 1 636 million and also up 25 percent among total viewers 3 287 vs 2 621 million
38816 is up 12 percent among adults 18 49 and up 18 percent among total viewers
38817 129 percent among total viewers vs 1 046 million and 116 percent among adults 18 49 vs 691 000
38818 it is unreasonable to attribute such an inordinate percentage of her airtime to one particular person at one particular federal agency as all business related
38819 lead all souls to heaven especially those in most need of thy mercy
38820 the secret dentists dont want you to know about yellow teeth
38821 im just here to help any way that i can
38822 oh yeah that was a rabbit out of the hat
38823 i had no idea he offensive line coach john matsko told me it was going to go a little fast for me they gave me this look today and the next thing you know i was in there with the first team
38824 i know everybodys got guys like chad on their short list and in some ways maybe some things happen for a reason were fortunate to get him in here
38825 well figure that out probably two days before the first preseason game
38826 were looking at options as far as getting guys out to practice
38827 we dont want to overwork willis because hes really been working hard but the knee is tender right now so weve got to be smart about that position
38828 e scelto tra persone di notoria indipendenza e di comprovata professionalita
38829 con determinazione adottata dintesa dai presidenti della camera dei deputati e del senato della repubblica
38830 non puo esercitare a pena di decadenza alcuna attivita professionale o di consulenza non puo essere amministratore o dipendente di enti pubblici o privati ne ricoprire altri uffici pubblici di qualsiasi natura o rivestire cariche elettive
38831 immigrati naufragio al largo di malta 2 donne morte 1 disperso
38832 guadagner lequivalente di 300 anni di lavoro di un operaio che votando rifondazione magari ha fatto eleggere proprio lei
38833 e se il conflitto quel conflitto tanto evocato cercato amato passasse anche attraverso la possibilit di entrare nelle case degli italiani e delle italiane per dire loro cose che vengono taciute o negate come i diritti di gay lesbiche trans e una scommessa che luxuria sicuramente in grado di tentare
38834 i really understood what it was like to be living with an abuser and how desperate you felt and how the structures in the state police courts and the law dont help women
38835 these women are the survivors not the ones who every five days are murdered they defended themselves and survived for that they get punished despite the fact that they had no help when they needed it
38836 the cases are not seen from the self defense constructed by lawyers but are based on male experience they all think of the scenarios of two guys in a bar relatively equal size and strength
38837 theyre unwilling to consider the scenario from a womans point of view they have less upper body strength not the strength to withstand that kind of battering unless she picks up a weapon to equalize the situation but if she picks up a weapon she may shoot him but she shoots herself too because her life is over
38838 most interesting to me was that for the majority of these women this was not an isolated incident but one of many traumatic events experienced through their lives
38839 when looking at the traumas identified by both men were more likely to discuss their trauma as occurring after they entered prison and women discussed theirs as occurring prior to incarceration
38840 i interpret this as women often returning to situations that may include interpersonal violence
38841 usually when people are using drugs heavily they dont live in very nice places like they might live in drug houses or they move in with people who are using drugs
38842 they get connected with partners who are also using drugs and those relationships are heavily affected by domestic violence
38843 the courts are trying to see if a woman technically broke a law not why she broke it
38844 they dont care that shes addicted to drugs and is with a man thats addicted to drugs and he made her take the rap thats not a defense
38845 sometimes they were defending themselves but its about applying the law at that point
38846 its a myth that lower income women are more prone to domestic violence it happens equally across all socioeconomic statuses
38847 when relationships go bad people often turn to drugs and alcohol to medicate themselves
38848 domestic violence can pretty much stem from any crime and lead to any crime
38849 there have been instances where youre leaving a house with maybe a man and a wife and you know damn well that the next day somebody is going to get beat up
38850 but we have to abide by the laws and restrictions we have there its a big problem and its not going away
38851 once i went inside and met the women and heard their stories especially those serving lifelong terms for murder i was stunned and appalled to realize who were so called murderers in womens prisons
38852 they acted in self defense against their abusers not only were they punished before going to prison but now theyre in prison as well
38853 if a violent aggressor comes into their assembly and starts shooting someone these armed individuals can take actions immediately to bring that to a stop
38854 i think everyone has gotten to the point where they know they need to watch what other people are doing around them and i think no one is exempt from this including the church
38855 we have many people in the building many entrances to accomidate our various entries of parking where will you intercept someone who comes in with the intention to do harm
38856 right now its a buyers market and a lot of people have been coming through and looking but few people have been making decisions
38857 this should open up an entire group of people whove been waiting this should give him some more opportunities to sell his house were in hopes that well see a lot more buyers out there than we have been seeing over the last three months
38858 its a wonderful thing for the housing industry and all of the relating industries from furniture to carpet to paint and lumber
38859 as of october 1st they are doing away with the down payment assistance program after october 1st everyone will have to have a 3 down payment unless theyre a veteran or its a real housing situation
38860 we want to make ohios highways as safe as possible we want to make the public aware that these things are occurring and the highway patrol is investigating these incidents and trends throughout the state
38861 it may be able to help us determine common factors and whether individuals are coming from particular locations
38862 we have a little bit more in depth investigative action and we may be able to address and prevent future instances of this this is something weve not given attention to in the past right now were still evaluating things
38863 it could be intentional contact between one vehicle and another or something being thrown at another vehicle
38864 it could be that a domestic occurred in a rest area or in a vehicle while it was going down the road it also could the vehicle was stopped
38865 it is a populated area with cleveland canton akron and youngstown however there are other populated areas like dayton and columbus
38866 because of the number of motor vehicles that traverse both counties we probably would be subjected to increased numbers
38867 the guy gave me an outside release basically i stayed underneath the guy and he wound up throwing the ball to where i could make a play on it
38868 i was just glad to be in position to make that play
38869 just knowing those guys came to congratulate me made me feel good about myself
38870 it helps me know i can help this team win
38871 he was there all last season playing 16 games two starts watching film
38872 he developed in a different way me in front of everybody him being at practice and getting his shots here and there
38873 he can teach me as much as i can teach him
38874 were pretty much at the same level second year players with minimal talent were raw talent trying to make plays
38875 we both make plays thats pretty much how were similar hes more a tougher type of player im tough but im more of a smooth finesse style of player as opposed to him being more of a rough edgy type of player
38876 thats pretty much the way our personalities are as well we complement each other really well
38877 i could tell that what i had was definitely not a bluegill
38878 to my surprise i could see the brilliant flash of orange as it hit sideways
38879 in ohio you can buy these specific types of piranha in a pet store and they will grow as large as the tank will accommodate
38880 one of them admitted to being there cheatham and discussing it but not doing it
38881 people are always trying to get you to mess up or step out of character its fun but its a lot harder than i thought it was going to be
38882 i left the hospital because i was tired of the stress to me this is the perfect job
38883 i thought they would enjoy the historical part of it
38884 because its different from their country theyre seeing things that most french dont see when they come to the states
38885 i enjoy that you can actually learn something and that the people are dressed up it makes it fun for kids
38886 its a little more hands on than a regular museum
38887 i do more running in the clubhouse than i do on the field
38888 i was more relaxed i had a different feeling on the mound
38889 i hope no one was in the middle of their backswing when it happened
38890 im glad i did it in a tournament my parents my teammates and my coach all saw it even a couple of boys saw it too walking by the green
38891 all of the parents started screaming and yelling and jumping up and down the two girls i was playing with perry teammates steff camarata and nicole waers had just gone absolutely crazy
38892 people have been coming after us for the past three to four years so for me its not much different were a very good team so it makes people want to beat us which makes us step our game up a couple notches
38893 im surprised and really really pleased with how our girls played
38894 i didnt hit the ball as well as i usually do
38895 i had to scramble my way in i was keeping track of clark
38896 i knew i had to get birdies and put myself in better position
38897 give jon credit he played very well he just had that one hole that cost him
38898 i wouldve won the tournament without that hole the way i was playing
38899 i didnt think id get 70 yesterday i did a little better than i expected
38900 i really wanted to win because it was my last time out here
38901 but i had to compete with light he gets up and down in places i didnt even think was possible
38902 youre not going to hit a perfect shot every time
38903 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
38904 the field is still the same as it was in the past theres just one guy missing so it really should be just as exciting and good golf as theres been in the past
38905 were slowly getting it to where we want it to be
38906 its just a matter of getting out there and playing everything is starting to fall together
38907 i tried to play to the fat side of the fairway instead of just hitting down the middle and i came off a little bit
38908 it was a bad double i would have loved to make a bogey but a double is always a bad way to finish
38909 i didnt capitalize on some opportunities that i had and didnt make as many birdies as i would have liked
38910 but i hit a lot of good shots drove the ball well and played aggressively throughout the day when i did get in trouble on a couple of holes i was able to get down and salvage par
38911 unlike past years where we knew things would be ok i cant say right now things will be ok
38912 its extremely tight there are still some shortages that we have to make up
38913 were looking for anything they can to help increase the general fund at this point
38914 as of this date thats the last thing anyone wants to do but that is as of this date layoffs are not on the table as we speak
38915 the last thing i would want to do is lay people off
38916 im praying hard were monitoring it on a daily basis and watching all the revenue that is coming in and were looking at ways to increase revenue
38917 we go through a pretty vigorous workout in june and part of july
38918 its not too bad its hot but you just have to get acclimated to it
38919 we probably could go in right now on offense and defense and probably play a game although i dont know how varied and productive we would be
38920 theres obviously a lot of things that we still have to do but we got a lot of offense and a lot defense in during those summer camp days we pushed the kids mentally and physically and they did a nice job picking up things
38921 you can sort of see things starting to come back around now that weve started two a days and were going back over some things but were also busy putting in some new things but you just cant put everything in at once because that would be too much
38922 beside the wing t were going to be incorporating some spread stuff into the offense this year a lot of 3x1s and 2x2s and also throwing the ball as well as running it
38923 weve basically got two different offenses going and that will hopefully produce some problems for some people on the defensive side of the ball
38924 on both sides of the ball were installing a lot things
38925 a lot of our midget league teams are doing it and then you get up through the eighth and ninth grades
38926 all our teams are running some form of it maybe not to the extent that we are on the varsity and that does make it easier when it comes to installing it on the varsity level

38953 state with particularity each point of law or fact that the petitioner believes the court has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the petition
38954 it goes without saying that the panel cannot have overlooked or misapprehended an issue that was not presented to it panel rehearing is not a vehicle for presenting new arguments and absent extraordinary circumstances we shall not entertain arguments raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing
38955 at the outset we note that even though the order edward challenges is one imposing the equitable remedy of a constructive trust our review is de novo typically the imposition of a constructive trust is a matter for the discretion of the trial court here however the issue is not whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a constructive trust but whether the marital settlement agreement provided a legal basis for the trial courts order edward has asked us to review only the trial courts interpretation of the agreement our review of a courts interpretation of a marital settlement agreement is de novo
38956 although jury instructions are generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion our standard of review is de novo when the question is whether the applicable law was accurately conveyed
38957 t he applicable standard of review depends upon whether the question presented is one of fact one of law or a mixed question of fact and law
38958 are questions in which the historical facts are admitted or established the rule of law is undisputed and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard or to put it another way whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated
38959 definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed
38960 when a trial court rules on a motion to strike an affidavit in conjunction with a motion for summary judgment the appellate court reviews that ruling de novo
38961 failed to comply with the requirements of illinois supreme court rule 191 in that it contained unsupported assertions opinions and conclusions regarding plaintiffs expectations about the st paul policys coverage
38962 in this case respondent challenges only 1 the sufficiency of the evidence presented to warrant his involuntary admission and 2 whether his hospitalization was the least restrictive treatment alternative the answer to either challenge in this particular case does not constitute a question of public importance nor would either answer provide an authoritative determination to guide public officers in the performance of their duties in mental health cases that is because orders involving involuntary admissions of other respondents undoubtedly will be entered and challenged based on the particular facts presented in such cases in other words resolving routine sufficiency of the evidence arguments will rarely have precedential value accordingly we conclude that respondent has failed to clearly establish the criteria necessary to satisfy the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine
38963 although respondent has a history of mental illness and his psychiatrist had previously treated him on several occasions during hospitalizations nothing in the record shows that his prior hospitalizations were as a result of petitions for involuntary admission more importantly even if another petition for involuntary admission were filed as to respondent he would not be subject to the exact same action instead any future involuntary admission petition would involve the same party but a different action under different circumstances in particular the evidence presented in support of a future petition would be different than the evidence presented in support of the petition in this case accordingly we conclude that respondent has failed to clearly establish the second criterion necessary to satisfy the capable of repetition exception to the mootness doctrine
38964 an adjudication could return to plague a respondent in some future proceedings and could affect other aspects of the respondents life
38965 we now believe that the collateral legal consequences exception to the mootness doctrine has no place in determining whether an issue is moot in a mental health case regardless of whether a previous involuntary admission order as to a particular respondent is upheld or reversed on appeal that respondents history of mental illness and involuntary treatment will continue to exist and will be a factor that treating medical personnel may consider it is that history that will possibly follow the respondent not the fact of an adjudication

38970 a motion to compel arbitration is analogous to a motion for injunctive relief
38971 illinois courts disfavor a finding of waiver however the right to compel arbitration of a dispute can be waived as with any other contractual right illinois courts will find waiver of a partys right to compel arbitration when a partys conduct is inconsistent with an arbitration clause thus indicating an abandonment of the right to arbitration additionally a party waives its right to arbitrate by submitting arbitrable issues to a court for decision illinois courts also consider the delay in a partys assertion of its right to arbitrate and any prejudice the delay caused the plaintiff
38972 the plaintiffs are trying to slip out of their contractual duty to arbitrate we should not let it happen i believe the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the defendants motion to compel arbitration
38973 the admission of any oral statements going to the intent of the parties at the time that they entered into the real estate contract and that it again objected to such evidence in its brief filed with the circuit court prior to the commencement of trial
38974 timeliness requires that an objection be made when the evidence is offered at trial although a party may have objected to the evidence at some pre trial stage in the proceedings or unsuccessfully moved to bar the evidence prior to trial it must still renew its objection at the time that the evidence is offered failure to renew the objection when the evidence is offered at trial results in a waiver of any challenge to the circuit courts consideration of that evidence

39105 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
39106 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
39107 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
39108 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law

39118 maybe its just a way to formally acknowledge a relationship that already exists between the writers and myself i dont aspire to write the show i enjoy the fact that its a collaborative thing that we do and enjoy that i trust people to write it and trust them to let me say it the way i see fit but i think maybe i am able to give some perspective as far as the connective tissue between beats or story developments
39119 oh my god i saw your show im now going to download it or im going to get showtime

39133 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
39134 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
39135 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
39136 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
39137 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
39138 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
39139 its hideous no one will be willing to buy it and it scares the family to even look at it
39140 what theyre going to try to argue is that im too risky basically what theyre saying is they didnt do a good job but im too risky

39145 and i think people are struggling that extra money that the single mother is putting in her car isnt helping her buy the paper and pencils

39152 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
39153 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
39154 hey tell me what kind of place is the outside
39155 a new and some would say very negative ad from john mccain
39156 the ad suggests that obama is just like these two celebutantes more style than substance
39157 so this issue of celebrity what were saying is theres all this raw excitement theres this screaming and cheering hundreds of thousands of people turning out at these events and maybe theyre trying to touch on this is there a possibility and a fear on your part that celebrity starts to overwhelm the message or become the message itself
39158 good morning blonde sided a controversial new john mccain ad compares barack obama with britney spears and paris hilton is it over the top top advisors for both campaigns square off this morning
39159 mccains advisors were asked if they were portraying him as frivolous and irresponsible the way many see britney spears or paris hilton their response yes analysts say its a concerted effort by the mccain campaign to define obama for voters
39160 they may not be 200 000 strong and theyre certainly not european but they are cheering and enthusiastic for john mccains leadership
39161 however real quickly robert and im running out of time you did respond with a negative ad so at what point is it a slippery slope and do you risk having any claim to a higher ground
39162 and that was the moment the familys suppressed emotions brimmed over
39163 i thought that she found out about the relationship five six months after it happened and we were working on it we have an appointment tomorrow to see a counselor and i just think she just got very angry
39164 she did text me asking me a question as to where is your gun and then when she did that i noticed that it was missing
39165 without provocation suddenly pointed and discharged a handgun impacting the bed inches from where the victim was lying
39166 victim then fled the bedroom exiting the residence through a rear porch area while the defendant discharged a second round victim continued to flee toward a neighbors residence where the defendant discharged additional rounds
39167 she just kept saying you know where i spent all day today

39188 even though this project is in clear violation of the mccain rule because it was not authorized nor requested we are happy to provide the funds at his request and the request of other members of the arizona delegation
39189 i would like to request that epa either re program 5 million out of existing funds or earmark the amount from an appropriate account

39210 if we go on strike there are delayed responses to fire calls in the area and its a gun the state government continues to hold to the heads of emergency service workers whenever we do have these disputes
39211 what was clear from the delegates meeting this morning was that the guys are disgusted that their working conditions and their families futures are under threat
39212 we demand morris iemma intervene immediately and were putting him on notice that firefighters are close to walking out of their stations
39213 the conditions that weve fought for theyre decent working conditions and they want us to sell them off for a pittance
39214 the community is at risk of losing adequate fire coverage
39215 but my grandmother and my mother both had breast cancer so my sister and i decided right we need to do something

39225 what matters is how we treat one another and making the world a better place
39226 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
39227 no one should have to live like this and no one did anything about it
39228 consistently fought to make livable affordable housing in mixed income neighborhoods available to all
39229 government is just not as good at owning and managing as the private sector because the incentives are not there
39230 i would argue that someone living in a poor neighborhood that isnt 100 percent public housing is by definition better off
39231 no one should have to live like this and no one did anything about it
39232 in the winter i can feel the cold air coming through the walls and the sockets
39233 you could hear them under the floor and in the walls and they didnt do nothing about it
39234 its difficult if not impossible for a private company to maintain affordable housing for low income tenants
39235 i started getting complaints from police officers about particular properties that turned out to be rezko properties
39236 i didnt see him nor have anything to do with him after that

39244 wow this could just be the perfect retreat for us writers to come and write our book
39245 if the earth turns backwards will we be walking backwards too
39246 its the present practices of the church that im seeking to reimagine not the church itself
39247 to articulate a biblical spiritual theological and practical answer to the question is there a viable way of doing church outside the institutional church experience and if so what does it look like
39248 the church is the earthly image of the triune god
39249 the reformation recovered the truth of the priesthood of all believers
39250 recovering the organic expression of the church and the practical headship of jesus christ necessitates that we forsake our ecclesiastical patches and band aids
39251 when your soul is once turned toward god the god who dwells within your spirit you will find it easy to keep turning within the longer you continue to turn within the closer you will come to god and the more firmly you will cling to him
39252 if a new convert were introduced to real prayer and to a true inward experience of christ as soon as he became converted you would see countless numbers of converts go on to become true disciples
39253 the present way of dealing only with external matters in the life of the new convert brings little fruit burdening the new christian with countless rules and all sorts of standards does not help him grow in christ here is what should be done the new christian should be led to god how by learning to turn within to jesus christ and by giving the lord his whole heart

39263 on the financial front todd recently told the crowd that god had told him that there were 1 000 people who would give 1 000 and that they would be blessed 1 000 fold robert called stephen strader to confront the unbiblical nature of that appeal
39264 what i am saying is that we need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland and that we need to stop repeating claims being made on the air lest we end up getting splattered with the collateral damage when certain issues of false claims embellishments and lapses of integrity begin to come out more publicly
39265 need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland
39266 as a member of ica peter wagner actually caused many questions to come my way because of my membership there i will no longer be involved with that organization and actually have not tracked well with them and some of their agendas since i have been involved with them however i have enjoyed the many relationships i have developed from going to the annual meetings most all of those relationships are also disengaging from their affiliation with ica because of many issues beyond lakeland
39267 the ica leadership continues to adopt belief systems without seeking the advice and counsel of members
39268 i think that there is a chance that many may disassociate with the ica depending on todd continuing to reveal his deceptive doctrine and peter continuing to support such doctrine

39271 dan bahwasanya ada sebagian orang dari manusia meminta perlindungan kepada sebagian dari kalangan jin maka jin jin tersebut justru menambahkan rasa takut yang sangat kepada mereka
39272 dahulu kami para jin berpandangan bahwasanya kami memiliki keutamaan dibanding manusia hal ini disebabkan mereka meminta perlindungan kepada kami kalau mereka singgah di satu lembah atau tempat yang asing di suatu daratan atau yang lainnya sebagaimana ini adalah adat bangsa arab ketika zaman jahiliyah mereka meminta perlindungan kepada penguasa tempat tersebut dari kalangan jin agar tidak menimpakan kepada mereka suatu musibah buruk sebagaimana kalau salah seorang dari mereka masuk ke negeri musuh dengan perlindungan dari salah seorang pembesar di situ ketika jin melihat manusia meminta perlindungan kepada mereka karena rasa takut mereka maka mereka tambahkan rasa takut tersebut kepada mereka sehingga rasa takut tersebut semakin hebat dan mereka semakin butuh untuk berlindung kepada para jin tersebut

39277 the conflict defines who we are it is all that we have witnessed throughout our lives
39278 our earliest childhood memories are of violence of gunshots firings grenades land mines crackdowns raids and searches death has become normal for us
39279 we always carry fear in our hearts fear that firing will break out fear that grenades will be thrown fear that the army will catch up with you and ask for id cards ask where youre from claiming that you are not a kashmiri but a militant from outside that you are giving shelter and food to militants
39280 i am still frightened of leaving my home after six
39281 but i am also frightened about what will happen inside my home
39282 we were never allowed to travel far or to play after dark all our mothers wanted was to see us before their eyes
39283 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
39284 this is the first time a congressional committee has ever passed consumer protections for credit cardholders
39285 if you press in one side of the balloon it pokes out on another side of the balloon
39286 the result will be higher costs for consumers reduced access to credit for those with an imperfect or limited credit history and less access to low credit options
39287 weve come up with something where i can actually keep my arm going and throw and not feel it
39288 weve done that a few times just to keep the arm going go from there in a few days i feel like ive been saying a few days for about three weeks im honestly tired of talking about it tired of dealing with it tired of looking at it tired of touching it
39289 i did my throwing today and im going to quit thinking about it for a while
39290 its the darndest thing ive ever seen as far as skin i cant explain it and nobody here can explain it ive been to several doctors and i just havent gotten any better we tried just about everything we could think of and probably tried some things we shouldnt have time will be the best thing for it
39291 one doctor says keep it wet the next one says dry it out
39292 flip a coin its the pressure on the ball that causes the pain its not a burn its not a blister anymore its an open wound
39293 it should feel good ive had a couple of weeks off even when it the blister first happened i was throwing the changeup just to keep the shoulder going
39294 really the consensus was lets stay the way we are were happy with the alignment that we have one of the things thats helping our pitching is the good defensive play were putting on the field we didnt want to change that formula
39295 weve got enough personnel where we can rest our team like we were doing earlier in the year we had to get away from it with injuries and it started to show but we can do that and keep these guys rested as much as possible lets stay away from injuries and keep playing solid baseball
39296 i dont want to put too much into it i just appreciate it
39297 they come up here to cheer for us and thats pretty exciting its exciting for a cubs player but its also exciting for the game of baseball to see that many people make that much of an effort and put it into this kind of a series that makes the game exciting
39298 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
39299 were a better team than we showed the cubs this series
39300 its more than frustrating frustration is when you lose close games
39301 if it was in september yeah this would hurt but we have plenty of time to recover from this to get back on track and right the ship so to speak
39302 this is four games where we got outplayed we got spanked they did everything right this series they pitched great they made every play defensively they found every hole offensively everything went right for them but it gets turned around quick too
39303 but thats what ive seen from cubs fans ever since ive been in this league
39304 the hit batter with 2 strikes turned the game around right there
39305 that 0 2 pitch where he hit derosa hes got to get him out in that situation
39306 they just beat us theres not much more to say
39307 he said that he thought gagne did it on purpose
39308 i didnt get hit but i know where that came from
39309 i would bet a lot of money that didnt come from the pitcher
39310 nobody is happy after a game like this and id be upset if they were

39313 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along
39314 im not so sure those gains are sustainable exports are likely to slow with the slowdown in europe and japan
39315 consumers used the stimulus check more for basic necessities as opposed to more discretionary items
39316 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
39317 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
39318 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
39319 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
39320 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
39321 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
39322 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
39323 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
39324 gary mckinnon no es un terrorista ni simpatiza con los terroristas
39325 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military

39365 i find it almost unimaginable that were having this conversation
39366 its going to get misused its probably going to be misused on a daily maybe even an hourly basis
39367 the frustrating thing for me is weve spent billions of dollars we hired thousands of people and have we really improved that much
39368 shocking them like a dog if they get out of line

39386 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
39387 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
39388 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards

39392 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
39393 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
39394 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
39395 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
39396 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
39397 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
39398 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
39399 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
39400 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
39401 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
39402 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
39403 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
39404 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
39405 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
39406 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
39407 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
39408 you have value on the ground more than you spent

39424 the combination of low inflation and productivity gains are key factors in our economic growth
39425 we think that interest rates are coming down not going up
39426 the deflation of commodity prices and the impact of imports is going to bring down the cost of goods sold in the us because of the strong dollar its hard for the fed to raise rates
39427 although we lost this was the most valuable goal weve scored in the qualifiers so far
39428 i cannot say that this was the best we could have done but i would like to remind you that our goal to reach the final round of the qualifiers was accomplished and this is the most important thing

39444 in the everyday i dont think so much about it but i know that environmental protection is very important
39445 i dont really know what to do so i just dont think about that
39446 one sees action to address climate change as an imperative to protect both the american and world economies this is an environmentalism of strength and unity
39447 conservation in the form of rationing became a patriotic act taking action was presented in these posters as vital for the common good of the nation and those who were willing to sacrifice were portrayed as attractive dynamic american heroes to face the ecological crisis posed by global climate change today a similar mobilization of america is required
39448 from what we can gather shes not really on the short list
39449 the reason hillary clinton is out is because shes not on message for barack obama her campaign is not about change she represents washington
39450 this is a sign that she is not being considered seriously by the campaign along with you we would have loved to have seen a dream ticket with both obama and clinton but because sen obama has made his decision to offer the slot on the ticket to another candidate we believe that continuing to ask him to pick hillary is no longer helpful to our partys chances of winning in november
39451 while we all were working toward a different result ultimately we and barack obama are working for the same eventual outcome getting ready to take back the white house and bring our country the change americans deserve and so desperately need
39452 ive said consistently that i think hillary clinton would be on anybodys short list
39453 hillary clinton would be in the ticket if the barack obama campaign felt that they were in some trouble with the voters that she brings the older women those voters in rural america battleground states they dont think they are in trouble there so they probably dont think they need her
39454 there is no one running mate that could deliver her supporters in one swoop the way she could but i do think for example that evan bayh of indiana could go to indiana which is turning into a battleground state and help obama there
39455 i am pleased that the judge has set a speedy trial date which should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
39456 we have a bill of rights and a trial by jury in our country to protect our citizens so that every person has their day in court
39457 a central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives

39482 en l neas generales lo vi bien desde la actitud las ganas y el convencimiento hay algunas cosas que corregir desde el aspecto t ctico aunque el estado de la cancha fue un condicionamiento la concepci n del juego que pretendo estuvo eso es lo importante
39483 todo est compensado y se est dando lo que planteamos
39484 se progres en lo que pretendemos en lo t ctico
39485 estoy muy contento de estar en un club como belgrano por lo que significa y por el grupo que se ha formado con muchachos b rbaros
39486 aqu te brindan todo lo que necesit s lo ten s lo que ped s se te consigue s lo tenemos que pensar en jugar y en tratar de conseguir el ascenso
39487 qu es belgrano es el mejor club en el que me ha tocado estar tuve la oportunidad de jugar en primera de jugar la copa libertadores de am rica de pasar por chile y estar en m xico pero lejos en toda mi carrera es el mejor club
39488 belgrano es candidato por naturaleza pero es un campeonato largo y con varios equipos que se han reforzado muy bien pero aqu tenemos claro que el equipo debe estar entre los cuatro primeros aunque lo que pretendemos es estar entre los dos primeros lugares para lograr el ascenso directo
39489 por supuesto que s lo que significa este club y las aspiraciones que tiene acept el desaf o y le estoy muy agradecido a belgrano por haberme dado esta oportunidad
39490 nos estamos preparando bien hoy por ayer se hizo un doble turno repasando lo f sico y lo t ctico complementando esto con una pr ctica de f tbol para ir deline ndonos para los amistosos
39491 no trajimos muchos refuerzos pero los que llegaron est n muy bien con dalcio pensamos que si viene alguien m s va a tener que ser uno que re na todas las condiciones y no traer por traer el trabajo realizado ha sido muy completo
39492 fijate que si belgrano hubiera hecho una buena campa a como local la temporada pasada hubiera ascendido directamente sin dudas porque de visitante le fue muy bien m s all de lo que pas ese d a en mendoza s que vamos a jugar con 20 mil personas cuando seamos locales y esa es una ventaja que no podemos desaprovechar la presi n tiene que ser para el rival
39493 la idea es siempre trabajar con un equipo base y esperamos que en los amistosos el equipo se vaya soltando
39494 vamos a tratar de hacer un equipo protagonista por eso deberemos trabajar mucho en defensa para aceitar movimientos porque en ataque ya tenemos gente con talento y de buen pie
39495 sometimes when you hear a lot of negative things you start to think maybe theyre right and it changes your mentality and how you go about things
39496 as far as im concerned im as positive as i can be because i think the kid still has what it takes to be a pro bowl player
39497 the only thing that really bothered me is for people to say that im not a team player

39505 el equipo muestra intenciones de buen juego con paolo frangipane distribuyendo y con la subida de los laterales va mostrando su manera ofensiva de encarar los partidos
39506 creo que venimos por el buen camino porque en lo f sico estamos b rbaros y porque hemos adoptado una idea futbol stica que entusiasma hay que seguir creciendo y esperar que los resultados nos acompa en
39507 puede que sea un partido duro pero en realidad a la larga todos los partidos del torneo ser n realmente dif ciles lo importante es que pensemos en nosotros que hagamos bien las cosas y que trabajemos bien porque si hacemos bien las cosas seguramente seremos protagonistas
39508 creo que hemos encontrado en pocos d as un equilibrio y un sistema de juego que va a ser importante en todo el campeonato y si lo sabemos usar ser productivo para nosotros y ac estamos agarrando confianza y conociendo a los compa eros

39575 gaas component demand is skewed towards mmic solutions with some limited demand for discretes as well
39576 despite the increase in unit demand asp pressures will mean the market for gaas devices will be effectively flat over 2008 and 2009
39577 while strategy analytics believes that asps will hold up better than previously forecast gaas device manufacturers targeting this market such as triquint and avago technologies in north america toshiba and mitsubishi electric in japan and ums in europe will need to optimize their supply relationships to maintain margins in this competitive market
39578 what makes it so difficult to become a woman or even the woman you liked to be are the uncountable expectations we are faced with

39590 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
39591 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
39592 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
39593 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
39594 we clearly are looking at an afghanistan where results are mixed the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
39595 it is very refreshing for zimbabweans to hear the negotiators saying the process is going on very well especially when it comes from the opposition and it comes from morgan tsvangirai himself it is good to hear that but again it is too early for ordinary zimbabweans to celebrate because as you know that there is a media blackout and we dont know exactly what they are discussing and if they are saying they are proceeding very well we dont know what is well but with tsvangirai we would have to hope that they mean well for the people of zimbabwe
39596 i dont think that if tsvangirai is saying the talks are going very well and they mean that mugabe will remain the helm of government mugabe remains the state president i dont think i will describe that as well because as long as you have mugabe in the leadership in whatever position but still the head there is no well in the talks because i dont think that is what the zimbabweans want
39597 zimbabweans want a new set of leadership even if it is transitional i dont think they now need a name called mugabe
39598 that is a very good move by the opposition when the talks started we said we were very skeptical about mugabes intentions we believed that he was only asking the opposition and the opposition asking zanu pf to come up with its lists of demands and the proposal that came from zanu pf shows that mugabes intention was to swallow the opposition and surely we cannot be creating vice presidents anytime there is a crisis and when there are negotiations we solve that by creating vice presidents
39599 we are aware of a recent posting on the internet and believe this is a malicious hoax

39604 let them who in grave peril are ranged against the church seriously bear in mind that after rome has spoken they cannot be excused even by reasons of good faith certainly their bond and duty of obedience toward the church is much graver than that of those who as yet are related to the church only by an unconscious desire let them realize that they are children of the church lovingly nourished by her with the milk of doctrine and the sacraments and hence having heard the clear voice of their mother they cannot be excused from culpable ignorance and therefore to them apply without any restriction that principle submission to the catholic church and to the sovereign pontiff is required as necessary for salvation

39643 when i first came to moriarty as principal in 1999 she was very encouraging and supportive

39645 ads featuring thin models made women feel worse about themselves but better about the brands featured

39648 ever since i was a small child i dreamed of making a solar powered car
39649 i always wanted to go around the world and see the beautiful sights but not in a petrol car only a solar car is 100 percent carbon emissions free
39650 this car was built by students i have no idea what to do if this thing breaks down
39651 my car likes the mountains maybe because it is a swiss car
39652 im a big fan of this world and i want it to stay as it is

39655 thats how we are going to find a cure for this disease
39656 we have lost some team members but weve gone on to win their battle
39657 today were treating cancer more like a chronic illness than a death sentence
39658 when i started this group there were three drugs available now there are so many im hoping we find a cure so our children and grandchildren dont have to go through this
39659 the amount of survivors i see reinforces my commitment to the american cancer society
39660 it was very moving you can imagine what those people have gone through
39661 having a relay each year reminds people the importance of having regular checkups
39662 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
39663 the purpose of the district attorneys office is to combat crime
39664 the main job of the district attorney is to act as a lawyer to enforce all of the laws of the state of kansas
39665 whether they be criminal laws or whether they be the laws of local government
39666 it is the idea that we can make topeka a better place to live if in fact we attack violent crime
39667 that will be my number one priority thats the reason i am running
39668 with the serious criminal problems we have in topeka today the top priority of the da must be fighting crime
39669 these other matters are in fact attended to not the main purpose of the district attorneys office
39670 i have been district attorney for the past eight years
39671 i have built a substantial record in improving the prosecution of criminal cases
39672 why are the political figures in johnson county so interested in the shawnee county district attorneys office
39673 more than half of mr ruckers financial support has come from out of county

39683 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
39684 my reaction is we finally look forward to the opportunity to examine fully mr arthurs claim of innocence by assessing witness testimony and dna evidence
39685 there is a good chance he is going to escape his sentence before all is said and done
39686 having to face execution is something that most of us can never really imagine
39687 i hired and paid money to thomas arthur not bobby gilbert to kill troy wicker
39688 i hope to finally end this hope to finally prove the innocence that hes claimed for 26 years
39689 i envy you you north americans are very lucky you are fighting the most important fight of all you live in the heart of the beast
39690 whether its modeling clay dolls or crayons a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar
39691 rather than putting players in the shoes of luke skywalker or frodo baggins were giving them the opportunity to be george lucas or peter jackson as they create their own universe from scratch
39692 it came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do
39693 i admit it is silly and juvenile but i dont think theres anything perverted vile or awful about it if people find it offensive they can simply not search for it online no one is forcing anyone to see this content
39694 i consider this very similar to child pornography at least to the extent of distributing the material to children
39695 user created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible
39696 it also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game since theyve created the world from scratch
39697 my initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldnt show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it
39698 lord how do you want me to pray about this
39699 third way distributive economics catholicism democracy and the good life
39700 it would be hard to convince anyone that the pub was once the premiere venue for literary and journalistic life in this country for intelligent argument and amorous adventure for meeting with the unknown
39701 my reaction is we finally look forward to the opportunity to examine fully mr arthurs claim of innocence by assessing witness testimony and dna evidence
39702 i hope to finally end this hope to finally prove the innocence that hes claimed for 26 years

39708 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
39709 he feels it is a major distraction and will draw players away
39710 it is not a surprising notion and given their support and leadership in the marketing of the game i would be very reluctant to support something they do not
39711 there appears to be an inherent bias in the atps plan in favor of certain events
39712 i want to be careful in what i say here
39713 of course its not my assessment as to his credibility that matters a whit but im disturbed by a gentleman of the kind of educational background who has been in court as much as he has doing what he did in this case and to some extent putting it on counsel
39714 so maybe its roger federer and rafael nadal that needs to be the plaintiffs here
39715 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
39716 and right now his intention is to go back to green bay and play football

39927 we wanted to create a dark mineral fragrance without evident floral notes ink smells animalic of blood horse sweat and has a mineral side to it it the fragrance had to be mystical and edgy the wet stone accord i created fits perfectly with the ink smell as they have some elements in common the magnolia is a composition of mine there is 10 in the formula and it gives off a cold floral rhubarb effect in the heart

39973 the greatest event of our life is our receiving the calling from our lord just as it was for those he called on the shores of the lake yet to follow christ wholeheartedly is never easy the person who enjoys a more or less steady job who thinks that the pattern of his life is set should recognize the danger lurking in this false tranquillity which may even be considered ones rightful due christ asks us to break with routine to cast aside the mediocre to go beyond a life of compromise with the divine vocation christ challenges us to undergo a profound change in our daily conduct god asks for everything including whatever we may have been reserving for ourselves he gives us light to see our failing which we may have up till now looked upon as beyond reforming but which turn out to be the price for securing the pearl of great value it is christ himself who seeks us out saying you did not choose me but i chose you and when christ calls he gives at the same time the graces we will need to follow him from the beginning of the way and throughout the rest of our life
39974 he gives us light to see our failing which we may have up till now looked upon as beyond reforming but which turn out to be the price for securing the pearl of great value
39975 i am surprised by how much i like my computer but i will never love it i have used several they seem indistinguishable when youve seen one pixel youve seen them all as a reader i often feel that i can detect the spoor of word processing in books particularly long ones the writers no longer slowed by having to change their typewriter ribbons fill their fountain pens or sharpen their quills tend to be prolix i am especially suspicious of word processed letters which smell of boilerplate word processed addresses are even worse what a pleasure it is to open ones mailbox and find a letter from an old friend whose handwriting on the envelope is as instantly recognizable as a face
39976 after the way washington and stanford happened it was evident that we all needed to come together and look at accountability issues

39991 if the iaea wants to give such nuclear status to india we expect the same for pakistan
39992 and we are backing it because we see india as a unique case
39993 as this agreement gets implemented i think you will see plenty more indian facilities coming under safeguards and this is good for the non proliferation regime and good for pakistan
39994 if you ask me the one big thing which worries everyone is that this could be a precedent for other countries to come some day before the iaea and ask for a similar agreement including your neighbour
39995 i think pakistan will argue that the secretariat should include similar provisions in any safeguards agreement it negotiates with them
39996 india may argue that the conditions for placing an indigenous nuclear reactor under iaea inspections have never arrived and none of its own facilities may then come under safeguards for years
39997 india is offering its facilities for safeguards and the decision is its own
39998 i am not saying the indians are going back on that offer but then why have a safeguards agreement which is structured in such a way as to give them a way to back out should they so desire
39999 someone has to take a stand and change some things
