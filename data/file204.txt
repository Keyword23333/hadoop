2040009 conceptually theres a great fit between bpm initiatives and soa initiatives
2040010 however our research shows that on the ground the way that soa and bpm are pursued means that theyre going to be difficult to join up
2040011 theyre driven by business teams and are largely focused on process modelling and business analysis tasks
2040012 few companies seem to have really gotten past that to deliver better or more flexible fit for purpose automation in support of improved processes
2040013 even in the organizations pursuing both bpm and soa the two initiatives arent heading on paths that will lead them to be joined up
2040014 the point were making here is that at the same time many of the vendors selling bpm solutions paint a very simplistic picture that positions bpm as a technology layered on top of soa which is also shown as a technology
2040015 its just like people used to paint a picture of application architecture back in the 1990s with business logic separated from integration database concerns
2040016 so the key message here is that there is real value in combining bpm and soa sure but if you try and paint too simple a picture of how the two things fit together youll probably miss many of the real benefits and also the real challenges

2040087 was certainly in the orbit of the cp communist party if not a member
2040088 start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the american way and all that
2040089 at some point in the future a teacher will add to her syllabus baracks memoir and instruct her students to read it alongside frank marshall davis equally affecting memoir living the blues and when that day comes im sure a future student will not only examine critically the frankenstein monsters that us imperialism created in order to subdue communist parties but will also be moved to come to this historic and wonderful archive in order to gain insight on what has befallen this complex and intriguing planet on which we reside

2040107 vmware has been focusing on standardisation efforts much more seriously of late they realise that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditised or near commoditised and like every other virtualisation vendor theyre eyeing virtualisation management as the source of green field revenue
2040108 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2040112 after nearly two years of careful study and analyses we decided fountain place is the right fit for tenet
2040113 the move coupled with our announcement earlier this week of improving financial performance marks an exciting time for tenet and there is no better place to continue growing our business than downtown dallas
2040114 in the last year alone we have seen a surge of corporate relocations to downtown
2040115 in fact as a result of companies like tenet more than 6 000 new jobs have moved to the area in the last year which just adds to the energy and excitement we see in our citys core then when you consider the development of landmark projects nearby like the trinity river convention center hotel and dallas center for the performing arts as well as a booming new residential population and growing retail base downtown only becomes more and more attractive its a new day downtown and we welcome tenet to our community

2040130 i think its a place for young people to come together to enjoy activities they have a common interest in
2040131 part of what were doing with the wellington street complex is geared toward providing activities for young people whether its soccer tennis softball or beach volleyball which is a new activity for the city or providing other activities that can be done at that facility or other facilities that are freed up
2040132 we have brought in other activities in terms of festivals such as east meets west and those things
2040133 when we look at the needs of youth and what they need sometimes we fixate on a building where they can go inside and so on
2040134 i understand that need is there thats part of what we can look at but i think there has to be a broader community buy in to that and the type of whatever it is youre going to build
2040135 i think we tend to look at facilities more so than a building to have facilities that young people can avail of much of this need is emphasized during the summer when schools out while there are numerous activities in the city not everyone avails of them
2040136 its always been there it will always be there if you talk to people in their 50s and 60s they will tell you when the white house was there thats where they used to go to their dances thats where they hung out
2040137 theres nothing wrong with young people hanging around talking having fun and getting out of the house the problem arises when maybe one or two make others feel uncomfortable thats not an ongoing problem that i see
2040138 i find most people are very respectful and very easy to get along with i think we have a very fine population of young people

2040156 were working with all of our partners to have as much of an international presence as possible by that date
2040157 the plan is to keep building lebrons brand to stay authentic to keep true to him and his personality and only work with companies that can identify with lebron so that he can keep reaching more and more people worldwide
2040158 well be announcing two or three more global partnerships in the very near future and we have the new vista ad campaign in place that will be featured in 30 countries including china were well on our way

2040161 you know when youre lebron james coming out in the 2000s you already know how corporate america works
2040162 we were doing these calls for a few months before we realized that we needed something more
2040163 out of necessity we had to make them formal monday conference calls minutes are kept of our calls and then are distributed to those people outside the calls that need to be kept in the loop
2040164 between the three of us its crucial that were all on the same calendar we go through everything that we believe is a viable request and then we make recommendations to maverick and lebron and the ultimate say is definitely lebrons hes the engine and the pilot of this whole thing and just think this is solely for pr were not even talking about his marketing thats a whole different story
2040165 its a machine theres a financial arm a legal arm a pr arm a marketing arm
2040166 i would describe the whole system as having myself as the centerpiece and then the branches off it that keep it moving every day
2040167 you have to have people around you that you can trust you have to have people around you that know what theyre doing at their jobs you have to have guys who you trust to handle it because i cant have my hands and ears on it at all times its great that i have people at nike i have people at coca cola and i have people at my two companies king james which runs lebrons official web site and lrmr that i can trust to make the right decisions for me if im not there to make them
2040168 i think history will show him as a great player but it will also show him as the first person who understands his role as hes doing it
2040169 hes the first real superstar of the internet generation he understands that fully and doesnt shy away from it and wants to be a part of it at the forefront
2040170 he came in taking full advantage of the opportunity and you never see his name in any b s or any shit so he keeps his nose clean you gotta have good armor good surrounding a solid foundation everything hes earned he hasnt had anything given to him i mean hype is hype but hes made the so called hype into a reality hes humble thats what i most appreciate about the young kid he respects people that came before him hes created his own legacy and in this age thats refreshing to see hes one of the rare people i enjoy watching on tv
2040171 its true that in a way hes the first of his kind
2040172 you cant really base his business model on other successful models like
2040173 he has obvious authenticity hes likable he has a great smile his sport is growing so fast worldwide the only thing that i can possibly foresee as being a potential obstacle to the ultimate goal would be his team not winning championships
2040174 i dont think people look for me to make as many mistakes or fail like they used to early in my career
2040175 i think early on they were looking to see if i was going to live up to the hype now that ive exceeded everybodys expectations they dont know what to write they dont know how to turn it into more hoopla ive just quieted noise by playing well
2040176 everybody says i play like t mac but i wanna play like lebron he uses his strength out there and i like playing in the post id rather play like lebron

2040218 this involved business process mapping and aligning plans appropriately modernising procedures was crucial to our future progress
2040219 work was traditionally completed on paper based forms naturally this created issues in terms of efficiency therefore it was determined that an electronic driven business process was required to support all aspects from the initial contact to billing providers
2040220 the buy in of our practitioners was imperative they were challenged with working to new streamlined business processes and naturally were uncertain about their adaptability to electronic working
2040221 the critical aspect of carefirst version 6 for us was the introduction of careassess this provided us with the ability to develop our own forms and consequently replace the paper based case file as the primary record
2040222 our practitioners follow an easy to use interactive process that ensures case information is updated in real time this ensures key events are captured and reviewed as part of the decision making process
2040223 it used to take an average of 18 days for information to be recorded it was drawn out because data was passed to administration staff for input practitioners now input directly into the system in real time speeding access to services and delivering cashable savings
2040224 benchmarking figures that devon county council produced show that once the practitioners became familiar with the system there was a reduction in time taken to complete forms this is due to the form pre populating with data already held in the system for example there was an average reduction of 44 minutes to complete overview assessments 12 minutes to complete a care plan and 8 minutes to undertake case recording
2040225 to support practitioners we have developed a range of actuate reports to enable data quality assurance and improve operational management linking directorate performance to individual and team activity
2040226 the key change that has enabled increased productivity is our modern business process in particular direct input of information and phone based services
2040227 through mobile working we aim to enable staff to complete work online and offline regardless of whether they are in the office in the gp surgery or at home
2040228 a key factor in achieving progress where other local authorities have failed is the consistently strong governance and project management along with the continuity of both skilled internal capacity and strong internal leadership with senior management support over several years
2040229 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2040230 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people against the peoples mandate and against pakistan
2040231 the presidents options are either to issue an order dissolving the national assembly or impose emergency rule under which the government will be suspended and a new caretaker set up would be announced
2040232 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously
2040233 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4k byte sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
2040234 the cost per gigabyte of a 2 5 inch ssd is something like five times that of a hard disk drive
2040235 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
2040236 you dont have to be a software engineer to get involved and you dont have to program everyone is welcome to participate
2040237 but with a problem like designing the browser of the future we werent even sure where to start
2040238 the evolution of the browser seemed to be intimately intertwined with the evolution of the web and to some extent the underlying internet itself plus we had to account for trends in general computing technologies smaller faster powerful more connected and ubiquitous devices enabling new kinds of interactions and applications

2040244 the product has received remarkable feedback both on flavor and its haunting likeness to original absinthe
2040245 people are tasting absinthe again for the first time and loving it
2040246 i could drink this all day i wont but i could
2040247 weve been selling absinthe since it became legal in the u s in may of 2007 and it has been a great success right of the bat
2040248 there has been a lot of curiosity and excitement about obsello among our customers many of our customers are absinthe connoisseurs who had already tasted this brand overseas
2040249 we believe that the absinthe landscape will erode quickly if genuine high quality brands arent introduced soon
2040250 weve been on a 10 year quest for perfect authentic absinthe and have no doubt that our brand is better tasting and better in quality than any others available to consumers in the u s
2040251 we persisted so long because we were certain andy was the player we wanted
2040252 all transfer dealings these days particularly those involving large sums of money do take time but i never had any doubts the transfer would be completed

2040285 prominent in denouncing racism and discrimination and has no anti semitic or racist views
2040286 as a result of this case the station has now had to close down
2040287 whilst we accept the judges view that mr galloway is not anti semitic it is somewhat ironic that in his determination to prove it mr galloway has effectively shut down londons only jewish radio station and deprived the community of an increasingly popular focal point
2040288 i wanted to make it clear that the jewish community did not condone this sort of behaviour on air
2040289 i have no idea how george galloways solicitors obtained a copy of this letter and it certainly was not my intention for him to use it in any action he could bring against jcom
2040290 it is despicable that someone who was once so passionate about jewish radio could act so spitefully against it

2040310 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with senator mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about senator obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain
2040311 the e mail chain provided by the obama campaign is 100 inaccurate gstv never viewed or approved the spot to air nor did gstv receive an insertion order or payment for a media buy
2040312 campaigns that contacted gas station tv did not receive approval to move forward with a media buy on our network gas station tv must approve any ads running on the network and no political ads were sent to gas station tv for review and approval no invoices indicating approval from gas station tv to run a political ad were developed and at no time were related financial transactions completed with gas station tv and its partners

2040314 theyre tied to the screen with an 8 foot rubber hose
2040315 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2040316 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2040317 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2040318 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2040319 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2040320 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2040321 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2040322 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

2040331 keeping on top of legislative and regulatory requirements is a critical responsibility made more difficult because compliance efforts are still operating in project mode and have not yet been embedded into business processes

2040337 i look back on all the olympics and i had bad first days at every single one of them i dont know if thats just coincidence or something ive been doing wrong maybe ive been a little bit nervous going in to the event a little bit uptight and not sailing my normal style i dont really know
2040338 i certainly would like to start off this event in better fashion that i have done in the past

2040361 a blogger was disseminating erroneous messages regarding our collaboration with the crf on the 2009 i2 summit
2040362 i cant tell you who it is but i can tell you that whoever it is has a vendetta and for me it would be wonderful to just sit down with whoever is upset and talk to them this is a dysfunctional way to complain through this anonymity
2040363 i can tell you this there is no smoking gun here at a commitment on our end to do whats very best in terms of educating interventional cardiologists and the vast majority of them think this partnership is great
2040364 there are people who have had strong opinions about the tct meeting of the past but weve looked at all the details and were very impressed crf has the highest ratings from acc cme accreditation they may not always have had this but they do now and they certainly have agreed to all the things that we consider to be paramount in our approach to meetings content ethics and very clear transparency with respect to relationships with industry our view of it is whatever happened way back when i cant really answer to but im convinced today that the parties that were contracting with are committed to the same level of scrutiny as we require

2040372 we dont want to come to you and say we found chocolate on mars then come back and say we were wrong it was strawberry we dont want to do that
2040373 we have substantial evidence that our soils contain perchlorate chlorine with oxygen
2040374 more experiments and time are needed to resolve the results of the science experiments
2040375 i dont even understand why theres a press conference today
2040376 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new
2040377 i would assume they have been briefed about this by now
2040378 talking about the research when its scientists are only about halfway through the data collection phase and have not yet had time to complete data analysis or perform needed laboratory work
2040379 but we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission
2040380 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas
2040381 when were reported on first soil delivery we reported what we knew we had various anomalies
2040382 we dont want to come to you and say we found chocolate on mars then come back and say we were wrong it was strawberry we dont want to do that
2040383 nobody mentioned the possibilities of perchlorates to me before this i had to go back to textbooks but were all learning a lot about perchlorates now
2040384 a good earth analogy is the atacama desert where there is a natural accumulation of perchlorates and the they accumulate there actually is because it is very very arid
2040385 the perchlorates can be formed on the dust grains in the atmosphere and can also be chemical aerosols so its a combination of atmospheric and photochemistry that produces them in the atacama desert and its likely thats the same mechanism that would produce them on mars
2040386 in the desert on earth the perchlorates dont go anywhere because its very very dry
2040387 after that other groups found yes there are microbes there and irganics its just low levels and difficult to detect its extreme but it still supports life but in terms of it being an extreme environment for life its the dryness in the atacama desert that makes it extreme not the presence of perchlorates
2040388 that frankly is one of the problems when were rushed into print people tend to think were all experts on all things here
2040389 while i wish that was the case frankly part of the joy here is were surrounded by experts that press release descriptor is less than correct its an oxidant and not particularly an aggressive one
2040390 on mars you would expect it to be fairly benign
2040391 its not really going to react to anything even at earth temps it would not be very reactive it is stable so on mars the presence of perchlorate the perchlorate itself is not necessarily wouldnt be expected to be an inhibitor to life itself
2040392 perchlorate is considered highly oxidizing at high temperatures clarified quinn
2040393 if you ignite it its extremely energetic and exothermic and oxidizing and thats why it can be used as a propellant or rocket fuel
2040394 thats why its safe to transport it and then be able to use it as a rocket fuel perchlorates are highly oxidizing when theyre heated up but at this location on mars this perchlorate reacts very very slowly if at all at lower temperatures so its better to describe it as an oxidant or as being oxidized
2040395 what was shown in the viking biology experiments is that when the soil was mixed with water the peroxide decomposed
2040396 so the reactive component is not very happy and doesnt have a long lifetime in environments exposed to water which is a good thing when it comes to habitability
2040397 its not as aggressive it is essentially stable in water if you have a soil that contained both peroxide and perchlorate and you wetted it the peroxide would go away but the perchlorate wouldnt
2040398 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best
2040399 i was gratified to answer promptly and i said i dont know
2040400 its anybodys guess which one is dancing with which other one eventually when we put all this stuff together we might be able to tease out information about some of the things we cant directly measure because in the end everybody has to be dancing with somebody
2040401 these findings could keep a lot of grad students busy for a long time
2040402 an awful lot of sensitivity on the team about making any announcements about habitability
2040403 weve already been surprised a few times and i cant exclude more surprises we may discover were looking at something even more outlandish than we think this is mars right now we can say that there isnt anything there that precludes life
2040404 we will sample other locations and were also thinking about looking under some rocks there is a lot for us to do
2040405 it really doesnt limit us in terms of habitability in icy soil
2040406 if were lucky enough to see organic signatures it would not be too big a surprise
2040407 perchlorate is going to be a good marker for water on mars in the future because it is stable in water and moves with water
2040408 that means gradients could tell us a lot about the history of water on the planet it can show us whether water has been somewhere and whether or not that water has moved or whether there has been water exposure in the environment that is exciting
2040409 in the bigger picture perspective it potentially changes the way we think about life on mars neither in a bad way or good way
2040410 its terrible i dont understand why theyre closing it down its sad
2040411 i just wanted to show my support and give her my thanks because i didnt really know after today whether id actually be able to see her as i normally would
2040412 im hoping that i will still be able to go into phillip and make an appointment as usual
2040413 if not i dont know what ill do ive got a small child and trying to find a doctors surgery that still has open books is not easy
2040414 but how many times is this going to happen to us
2040415 is it because of the shortage of doctors or is it money we feel its greed put before people
2040416 i think no one likes change but i think its change for the better and i think the vast majority of patients the population of act would appreciate what weve done
2040417 the level that theyre at that not even ohio state has the rating that they have so what we want to try to do is help them be able to help other areas here in the northwest quadrant of the state of ohio
2040418 so its good for me to be able to understand exactly everything that theyre doing and what they want to try to do in the future
2040419 what were seeking from congressman latta are directions for funding
2040420 were not saying to him we want money were asking him whats the best way to search our funding through what he knows through what hes heard and his knowledge

2040422 we wanted to identify some of the strongest potential funding roots

2040441 they all have great chances of winning a gold medal in the event
2040442 we all know that jamaican asafa powell chokes on the big occasions as well as his countryman usain bolt despite their great performances in recent times
2040443 all athletes in the olympic event are there by achieving a certain standard so all runners will be very fast the difference will be the one who has the available expertise in managing stress
2040444 that is the reason why brown is so dangerous he has the experience of a world championship final in other words hes been there he knows what it is what it takes and i know he has that hunger for success and a point to prove
2040445 every opportunity was given so the athletes could be exposed
2040446 more than that we have a very good chance in getting things right for the 4 by 100 metres relay
2040447 the camp will allow the athletes to correct the blunders they made in the handing over of the baton in london despite their remarkable performance as long as they can maintain that time or do better they are assured of medalling
2040448 once the problems are corrected and i am sure they will be medals will come
2040449 scott has a great chance and cleoptara has to get into the 19 to 20 metres level to medal and i feel she will do just that
2040450 as an organization with the primary mission of protecting the health and welfare of the horse the aaep is strongly opposed to soring
2040451 this wonderful breed must be preserved and protected in a climate in which its future is not challenged by the practice of soring the true measure of success will be that soring no longer exists because the tennessee walking horse industry itself brought it to an abrupt end
2040452 putting the horse first veterinary recommendations for ending the soring of tennessee walking horses
2040453 the white paper is not intended to be a revision of the horse protection act
2040454 we know we are suggesting radical changes to current practices within the industry but if industry leaders are intent on solving this issue they will give serious thought to the recommendations that have been made
2040455 on behalf of the aaep i express gratitude to dr leitch who chaired the twh task force and the other dedicated aaep members who accepted the charge of this task force and were so thoughtful in the development of the white paper
2040456 i also want to thank the members of the various tennessee walking horse industry organizations hios who came last year to the first twh summit in lexington these groups encouraged the aaep to develop this white paper and they have a unique opportunity to eliminate the practice of soring
2040457 in essence the family are still together as a family
2040458 she is still not load bearing in the sense that she cant stand on her legs yet and she wont be able to even do that until she has fully recovered
2040459 the family is coping as well as can be expected in the circumstances
2040460 it is still too early my wife is not back at work rebecca is still in bed we are all still recovering we are nowhere near mended yet
2040461 rebecca is healing before our very eyes and we are grateful for the small mercies that have happened to us
2040462 the way the townsville community has rallied around us made us feel like we are a small community which is great to see that we still have that feel
2040463 as country people rosemary and i are from out west it is great to have that feeling in such a big place in townsville and we hope it never loses that
2040464 we come from communities of 600 people and 60 people and 12 people so we know what it is like to have an accident on a main road when you have to drive to and from work down that road
2040465 rosemary rebecca shaun and i would like to sincerely thank assistant commissioner paul wilson and the queensland police family townsvilles emergency services the staff at townsville hospital and family and friends and those in the townsville community for their heartfelt sympathy and support following the tragic death of jessica and during the recovery of rebecca
2040466 probably worst case is we would start construction in the spring and would be completed by the end of the year end of 2009
2040467 the reality is that this building hasnt been fully occupied in well over a decade
2040468 and as the tenant occupancy rate has continued to decline the cost of keeping the building up the inefficiencies that come with time in an older building we are to the point now that we spend over 400 000 a year to be in this building
2040469 that is money that is not going into the community that is money that is not advancing the mission and that is only going to continue to climb as we face more tenants looking at building options of their own
2040470 we dont have a lot of clients coming into this office
2040471 it is not reasonable to go to the community and to ask them to pay for a new building but there are donors who would have an interest in this new facility
2040472 while it gave them space and gave them a place it did not create a synergy or organizations evolving together and moving forward to solve the worlds problems
2040473 some had said that the idea of a community services building is a failed experiment
2040474 it comes down to dollars and cents when you can save 400 000 it goes right back into the community its a no brainer for us
2040475 we still know that if something comes up no dirt has been turned we arent that far along where we cant decide something different
2040476 from strictly a united way perspective this will enhance our mission
2040477 it will allow us to have more public access we will have more conducive meeting spaces to the kinds of meetings people want it will expand ability to help people and we believe the park like setting with the demolition of the current building is an asset to the downtown area that people are going to appreciate and enjoy
2040478 stephane dion ran his campaign the same way he would run the country deep in debt the only difference is this time he cant tax his way out of the problem
2040479 due to the current credit and mortgage crisis which has led to a drastic reduction of transactions in the housing market smea tons has decided it is not possible to sustain the whole of its operation
2040480 from august 1 our workington office on murray road complete with staff and nationwide building society agency has been transferred to aidan and jayne lillington trading as cumbrian properties

2040485 he had a good camp last year but he weighed 181 pounds and was a little bit high in body fat
2040486 he comes in here this year and hes 202 pounds and hes dropped some body fat to put on 21 pounds and drop body fat in a year shows he made that commitment
2040487 the main training camp is pretty far away i am working harder than i ever did and well see if im going to be successful
2040488 i cant say if i am ready right now because i have two more months here with barry brennan
2040489 my big weakness was i wasnt too heavy i was 190 and i wasnt too strong right now im 206 and i feel pretty strong they didnt talk to me about weight but i think they want me at 210 and im going to try to be around that
2040490 hes put on some good weight and that will help him this fall when he comes back to camp he needed strength and hes going to need even more to play 82 games in the nhl
2040491 the ice is tight here not as big as it is in europe so its an advantage for me
2040492 i dont know why but when i was younger i always liked playing on the boards it doesnt mean i dont want to skate but i just like it on the boards its good for me and i hope i can take that style to the nhl
2040493 hes a real real smart player and he sees the ice so well
2040494 hes more of a playmaker than a scorer thats his game he likes to set other players up he plays the point on the power play and controls the flow of the game from back there
2040495 hes a real real smart player and he sees the ice so well hes more of a playmaker than a scorer thats his game
2040496 hes never going to lose his instinct to be the playmaker he is but you cant be predictable right
2040497 you have to give them something else to think about hes got to shoot more
2040498 i think he can be a really special player in the league for a long long time

2040509 there are 2000 mosques in the uk if each mosque held an open day and attracted at least 1 000 visitors that will be two millions people the mosques can potentially reach out to
2040510 its just simple to do but theyre not doing it
2040511 in a climate where there is a growing fear of muslims mosques which are central to the community need to do something to tackle this
2040512 if someone had a query or if a non muslim wanted to know about what islam had to say on a certain issue they can easily ring the helpline and just ask
2040513 when there is a fire we ring the fire brigade when someone is having personal problems they ring the samaritans so when somepne has an issue about islam or just needs to talk why not ring a mosque helpline
2040514 these are practical steps that can make the world a better place
2040515 we also need to reach out to the media and politicians and people who are demonising islam
2040516 if a journalist has upset the muslim community with an article then invite that journalist to your home and build an understanding
2040517 the chances are they will be willing to listen to us so we need to reach out to them
2040518 mosques also need to have a media monitoring unit so that they know whats happening elsewhere in the uk as well as their own town
2040519 if a muslim woman is attacked for wearing the hijab the mosques need to know about it and note it down so we can collate information about incidents throughout the uk

2040525 an excellent marker of neurohormonal activity in congestive heart failure patients
2040526 even patients without a very impaired ejection fraction might have a severely impaired autonomic nervous system and it will be reflected in these ecg measurements such as heart rate turbulence
2040527 we dont know what the exact physiologic link is between wide qrs and the predictive value probably those patients are just sicker so thats why the turbulence slope works better in patients with wide qrs
2040528 the study by cygankiewicz et al is an important step toward identifying heart failure patients at high risk for scd or heart failure progression however risk stratification probably cannot be entrusted to a single parameter
2040529 combining measures of autonomic tone hrt baroreflex sensitivity heart rate variability etc with measures of electrical substrate t wave alternans signal averaged ecg etc may help to identify patients at high risk for scd and improve the selection of icd candidates in order to optimize the cost effectiveness of therapies

2040535 syria was bombed by israel last year to stop development of a nuclear facility allegedly built with north korean help the gaza strip bordering israel is now ruled by the militant palestinian faction knows as hamas so the coming change in israeli government takes on a new dimension and if an election is to be held it is likely to attract as much interest worldwide as that for president of the united states this fall
2040536 israels leaders have been spending a lot of time speaking about the threat of iran and about security issues like terror but they seem to be missing a large part of the population
2040537 both attacks have to be seen in the context of a slow but steady escalation in terrorist violence against israeli civilians and security forces over the past few months within jerusalem itself

2040540 were happy as i said on wednesday the matter is now closed
2040541 hes a manchester united player and hes happy to be here hes always been happy here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in his life thats made it difficult for him
2040542 the important thing is that weve ended all the stuff about real madrid as he gets older i think cristiano will appreciate being here more and more that happens with players the longer they stay here they dont want to leave
2040543 if you look at rio ferdinand who joined us as a young man from leeds united thats exactly whats happened to him hes now a real manchester united person he loves the club
2040544 and he comes from another country he comes from london its a different world there theres not a lot of difference from someone leaving london or portugal you come to a real football city which very few cities can say
2040545 i think real madrid now know theyre dealing with a different animal i cant deny that it was an important issue there are very few players that have left me against my will id have to think seriously about that one
2040546 its unusual for anyone to want to leave manchester united cristiano realises that too we had a good meeting over in portugal and clarified a lot of things
2040547 he was good and i was pleased with that thats why i was confident that everything was going to be all right
2040548 celebration of irish produce that showcases local food and drink products
2040549 this is the third year of the taste fest and i would congratulate the organisers on this hugely successful event
2040550 i know curleys have a tradition of supporting our local producers and indeed through their very own slogan buy local we do encourage their customers to do just that and buy local
2040551 i know sainsburys have also made clear their intentions to purchase local produce wherever possible which again is very encouraging for the future
2040552 shoppers should also recognise that by choosing local produce not only are they providing their family with nutritional goodness but they are also voting for fewer food miles and supporting local producers in rural communities
2040553 the variety of products on display at the taste fest once again goes to prove the underlying strength of our agri food industry and the quality of its products
2040554 if producers processors and retailers continue to work together with governmental assistance where needed and deliver what the consumer wants i believe that we will achieve a further increase in the use of local produce for the benefit of all

2040556 recent studies predict pc ownership will quadruple to 4 billion and double emissions by 2020 so implementing pc energy management solutions at home and in the workplace is a vital component of climate protection

2040559 it would require the capture of just 0 3 of the light falling on the sahara and middle east deserts to meet all of europes energy needs
2040560 generate up to three times the electricity compared with similar panels in northern europe
2040561 assuming its cost effective a largescale renewable energy grid is just the kind of innovation we need if were going to beat climate change
2040562 the biggest pv system at the moment is installed in leipzig and the price of the installation is 3 25 per watt if we could realise that in the mediterranean for example in southern italy this would correspond to electricity prices in the range of 15 cents per kwh something below what the average consumer is paying
2040563 each social network site offers a wide variety of tactics to choose from and in such a new market social marketers have little or no performance history to rely on
2040564 marketers could then use scores to compare relative site performance
2040565 if the level of engagement on an advertisers site resulting from a game widget scored low the publisher could provide guidance as to how to increase the score based on its knowledge of its own audience
2040566 the biggest problem for advertisers is that the likes of facebook myspace etc provide the user with an extension of their personal lives and a proactive approach by advertisers can be seen as an intrusion into their own space
2040567 the challenge therefore for advertisers is to make their links seem to be a natural part of the environment this is one of the reasons for the proliferation of applications on facebook
2040568 marketers are cautious of social media because in a digital environment where results can be transparently reported they need to feel confident social media will deliver tangible results
2040569 social media certainly is not right for every single brand and getting it right takes understanding of the target audience and what interests them they need to be engaged with in some ways it is similar to viral campaign it needs to push the target market audiences buttons for the right reasons and deliver results that justify the time and money involved whether its brand recall interaction with a widget or application or direct sales
2040570 many people believe its about broadcasting your own me me me channel to your immediate circle but also more broadly across the world wide web some say on the flip side that it is just another form of voyeurism watching people advertise themselves to all and sundry in a sense theyre both right one cant exist without the other

2040585 under this new law if an officer is able to verify that someone has caused an accident or is seen to be driving erratically because of the use of an in vehicle electronic device this new charge could be laid

2040593 im looking forward to walking out with sir alex ferguson on sunday i got a lovely congratulatory letter off him at the end of the last season which i appreciated very much
2040594 hes very very involved with the game at every level and is a real legend
2040595 winning the final here in may was a great feeling for us no team from outside the top four had won the cup in the past 13 years
2040596 right now for anybody outside the top four thats a big achievement the big four wouldnt be satisfied with that obviously theyve got to be there but its becoming more and more difficult for anyone else to win anything
2040597 it was great to get peter crouch in over the summer
2040598 his sale last time around played a massive part in bringing in the money that helped us get promoted
2040599 hes a terrific player and a lovely lad with it but to use him right you have to educate the players on how to play with him how to cross the ball and where to put it
2040600 if we can work on getting the best out of peter hell be terrific for us alongside jermain defoe
2040601 then theres the evergreen kanu of course and david nugent and ive taken young ben sahar on loan from chelsea hes busy and works hard

2040603 there were some of these plants along the side of the road and at that point we were not aware of what they were and unfortunately some were damaged

2040612 god does not spare people who commit such vile sin he obliterates them and everything around them
2040613 you live today in a time different utterly different from any past time on earth you are destined as no past generation has been to live in two worlds yes this world is the real meaning of world chaos today but there will be a resurrection

2040619 seems little has changed as far as human rights in china yet they have been able to secure the 2008 olympics with little more than isolated protests by activists and socially sensitive politicians this i feel is indictive of the decaying sociopolitical involvement of people in general

2040635 this is a sad day and i take no pleasure in doing this
2040636 your client sealed her fate on the street that night
2040637 given the political context of which this came about this does not look good it looks like her reversal is politically motivated because you have officials like the mayor saying they will try to get this reversed and then it does
2040638 when you come out in favor of something then reverse your stand after the mayor and other political leaders say they are going to work on it what is the public supposed to think
2040639 remember the newark workers you fired the housing authority workers you fired

2040642 the biggest thing is when you know your reads and know where you are going with the ball the footwork comes naturally and is easier
2040643 i did work on it this summer and i just have to keep getting better it was a good start but we just have to keep working
2040644 he looked smooth in the pocket and his footwork was good i was impressed with his overall play
2040645 crime is not just about the police response and policing crime is a multidimensional kind of thing it requires the whole community and a national effort
2040646 my personal approach to this situation as a challenge is one of zero tolerance and this means that we have to change attitudes about how we look at the situation and how we get the message out that each and everyone one of us needs to have the attitude of zero tolerance so we do not take anything for granted or keep information to ourselves that we know is of a criminal nature
2040647 they are known for their vicious activities when dealing with people who cross them
2040648 you see whats happening in the region and in other parts of the world where countries suffer people suffer and we dont want to get to this level we dont even want to compare ourselves to a country where that is happening
2040649 im sure that the majority of the bahamian people want a crime free community and so we work with that perspective in trying to eliminate crime as much as possible
2040650 we are looking at our situation analyzing it and employing strategies to deal with it i consider what we are doing to be pretty much successful and we are pretty much in control of what is going on our intelligence is active and alert and we are pretty much on top of whats happening in the community
2040651 you have one homicide and the entire country is up in arms but it is natural for people to be frightened when they see things happening in their neighborhood but they should know that there is a working police force that is responding to the situation and there is a competent police force working on their behalf

2040655 a lot of them have a procession that goes in the square and that starts off their festa
2040656 most of the people who go to the mass are italian american so theyre not fluent in italian
2040657 the concept of gender identity was fashioned by radical homosexual groups and advocates to protect the bizarre sexual behavior of a few people
2040658 the high number of petitions signed by the citizens of gainesville serves as an indicator of the power held by citizens over elected officials who choose to push a far left national agenda
2040659 the concept of gender identity was fashioned by radical homosexual groups and advocates to protect the bizarre sexual behavior of a few people
2040660 in practical effect these types of ordinances end up being used to intimidate and prosecute christians and anyone else who raises objections to this form of deviant behavior
2040661 extremists with special rights agendas can be stopped even in a liberal university town
2040662 their successful petition drive demonstrates that government still belongs to the people who want liberty and justice for all not special rights for special groups
2040663 we know the one contributing factor would be that it appears that a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout
2040664 the injuries i saw were primarily crushing wounds trauma as you would expect in a situation like this
2040665 we do feel fortunate that the bus was traveling northbound where the guardrail is and the overpass over the ravine there
2040666 had it been 100 feet prior to that it could have been in a deeper ravine it certainly appears that it could have been much worse
2040667 shes really nice very kind believes in god and do all the volunteer for the church
2040668 almost every year for the last 10 years we have a bus from our church leave here
2040669 one bus leaving wednesday night and one bus leaving thursday night this is the first time having a big accident happen here in the past we go up there and its ok no problem this time its a sad story
2040670 its usually the best way to go the bus is really not that bad of a ride i dont know what happened to that one
2040671 this is definitely the biggest thing thats ever happened to this church
2040672 peta stands for people for the ethical treatment of animals
2040673 i am horrified disgusted and appalled peta will never get support from me or my family ever again
2040674 peta is bunch of ruthless crazy people they do not deserve to have a voice
2040675 if you ever wanted proof that peta is evil here it is
2040676 i am a vegetarian and i am for animal rights and all but this is the most sickening thing i have ever heard
2040677 peta seems to have the collective intelligence of a turnip i presume they fake their compassion for animals because they bloody well have none for humans
2040678 it just goes to show that peta is just a bunch of wackos
2040679 peta needs a new pr director on the plus side this shows canadians how out of line petas thoughts are
2040680 i hope that some supporters will now finally see what a bunch of dumb lunatics peta has become and stop funding them
2040681 any credibility peta may have had once is certainly now lost
2040682 to help those wishing to make animal friendly decisions while in china
2040683 sharks are in decline worldwide largely because of the demand for their fins
2040684 vegetarian in the chinese buddhist tradition which prohibits eating onions and garlic
2040685 examined canadian and west african coastal data imagined where those sediments pooled before the continental drift then extrapolated to guesstimate whats off our atlantic coast today
2040686 resource estimates are highly dependent on the current knowledge base which has not been updated in 20 to 40 years for areas under congressional moratorium
2040687 overall impacts of exploration and production are reduced because fewer wells are required to develop the same amount of reserves
2040688 i would renew my request with the modification that the trigger be 10 a gallon at the pump
2040689 big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production
2040690 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2040691 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2040692 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2040693 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2040694 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2040695 wed like to take this opportunity to thank all those people that have made the festival such a success in previous years wed also like to whole heartedly apologise to the bands artists agents managers suppliers sponsors media supporters and festival goers that have been let down by our decision the decision to cancel has not been an easy one for the team behind the event
2040696 please accept our most sincere apologies during this most difficult time for all
2040697 impossible to determine the particular reason why the alarm system was not activated
2040698 the tragic death of nancy aun may have been avoidable

2040704 i am going to try and come back this year
2040705 once you touch the bottom there is no more than to go up
2040706 it is windy and kind of big so i just tried to stay on my board i got lucky to get a bomb and make the difference with my contenders and to advance trough to next round
2040707 there are very good kids here so i will take just one heat at a time and hopefully win the wildcard this year i am much more focused on the asp wqs tour with my brothers patrick and dane
2040708 i am stoked to advance through to round 5 with such a big result
2040709 my brand new board is very quick and perfect for these hollow waves i felt very comfortable in the water and i was able to make many moves on every single wave
2040710 i was stressed in the first events this season but i am feeling relaxed at the moment and want to keep any pressure away
2040711 i didnt hear my scores in the water because of the wind and rain but put several good turns together and it feels really good to keep going
2040712 i will try to surf my best and go as far as possible
2040713 following my results in this pro junior i will maybe take part in the one in ericeira but i am very focused on studying at the moment
2040714 nationally we are facing a critical shortage of new nurses entering the workforce
2040715 we want to do everything we can to prepare baccalaureate nurses to deliver health care and to assume positions of leadership in health care we know that the quality of patient care is dependent upon having a nursing workforce that is well educated as well as adequate in size we would like to thank wired for their generous support and for their willingness to be a community partner for the improved health of the population
2040716 for 55 years the university of evansvilles nursing program has been offering a high quality education to aspiring nurses
2040717 thanks to wireds generosity we now have another tool to keep us on the cutting edge of nursing education
2040718 why do all convenience store clerks regardless of gender call me sweetheart honey or sweetie pie
2040719 no but seriously seymour this lice story of yours is getting out of control
2040720 every installation of fedora 2 should update to 2 2 3 due to the security update there have been no exploits that have been discovered but it is important to maintain repositories at the latest security update level
2040721 when we got off the plane we immediately noticed the pollution
2040722 because of the conditions of the heat humidity and pollution it is going to be very demanding
2040723 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
2040724 i think the biggest impact on the athletes is going to be impaired performances primarily for those who are endurance athletes who are relying on their incredible lung capacity their efficiency and their ability to take in oxygen
2040725 most of these pollutants all in slightly different ways will diminish their performance
2040726 with ozone there are big differences in susceptibility within the population
2040727 ozone could be somewhat of a spoiler ozone creates oxidated damage and people differ genetically in the ability to detoxify toxic oxygen
2040728 its sort of a twofold thing why endurance athletes and elite athletes are as good as they are and what it really comes down to is that the training that theyve done has resulted in better efficiency of how their lungs and their muscles work together
2040729 probably the best measure we have of athletic performance from a physiological standpoint is the which is the maximum oxygen consumption by the body that you can attain when you measure this in someone whos an elite athlete its very very high
2040730 their lungs and how their body utilizes the oxygen they pull in is dramatically different the rest of us have a very low v02 max were not able to have the same level of oxygen consumption
2040731 breathing that in can bind carbon monoxide molecules to our red blood cells where oxygen normally binds and hinder your oxygen consumption and your performance
2040732 theres some thought that he really trained his muscles in such a way that they very efficiently used oxygen an elite athlete can get that much more strength and endurance from every molecule of oxygen that you take in
2040733 your body says this air is bad breathe less of it and thats a defensive mechanism
2040734 for athletes that means they will go into oxygen debt sooner and will start cramping up at an event like the olympics that could be disastrous
2040735 particulate matter is actually breathed in and the particles deposit on the lungs and can actually pass through the lungs and into the bloodstream
2040736 both ozone and particulate matter can cause acute reactions in people exposed to them
2040737 particulates affect not so much the oxygen but how our bronchial tubes our airways react
2040738 the typical example would be an asthmatic asthma is a situation in which you are reacting to your environment your airways tighten up the bronchi restrict in response to what they get exposed to
2040739 i suffer from asthma and im having to take supplements to protect my lung lining
2040740 our competition lasts 6 8 hours a day for a whole week so the build up could have a bearing
2040741 even people who are not asthmatic can find themselves with some reaction we may have people who have never had trouble before but they have been training and living in places that are much cleaner
2040742 you can really feel the particulate stuff getting into your lungs
2040743 after the race when we tried to talk or laugh or cough it was pretty tough
2040744 every olympics site has its particular characteristics and with beijing air quality is a factor
2040745 altitude was a factor in mexico city elite athletes need every last edge on their side to do their best and this is the issue for this olympics
2040746 we will not see as many world records certainly in the outdoor endurance events and we may see a bit of variability in terms of who is expected to win because health is such an unpredictable factor exposure to pollutants and what that does to our bodies and our lungs and how we react is very different from individual to individual
2040747 it will be very interesting to see how this plays out
2040748 i know beijing has done a lot and you have to give them credit for trying to make some progress in this regard you hope that its going to be a long lived thing not just for the olympics
2040749 we enjoy it performing so much theres really no time to argue and look at this crowd thank you for doing that waiting
2040750 je kunt wel geloven dat er eens een dag komt dat alle software gratis zal zijn of open source is maar dat is in ieder geval niet morgen en ook niet volgend jaar het is waarschijnlijk pas over tien jaar

2040752 with the next presidential election beginning to heat up im starting to hear a lot of talk about the subject of character again character is an interesting human trait we tend to respect in this society it has no physical form and cant be detected by any machine but it is an essential element of the human condition character is not some tangible object your senses allow you to see touch smell or hear nonetheless you know when you are around someone who has it it is also not something you are born with it is something you must create develop and then nurture character is built incident by incident just as a wall is build brick by brick the kind of character you build depends on the kinds of choices you make during those moments of truth just as you use those bricks to dictate the kind of wall you end up with the same can be said about the construction of your character it does not demand that you possess any particular physical attributes nor does it require any financial resources character is available to all who posses a good moral compass and a desire for good and those opportunities to build your character are precious indeed
2040753 i came out here and saw little babies trying to stick their mouth out to gasp for air and that saddens me
2040754 i think its interesting that if we had won that game against portsmouth would we have won the treble again
2040755 you cant take these things for granted but given the fact that they then played west bromwich albion in the semi final it gave them an outstanding chance of winning the fa cup
2040756 if we had reached that stage it would have been interesting which team i would have picked because we had a full squad at that time going into the last few weeks of the season
2040757 so if we had reached the final this year i would probably have rested half a dozen simply because our priority would have been to win the european cup final as it was in 1999 but we were disappointed at losing the game against portsmouth because that was a match that we should have really won
2040758 last year was a fantastic season and its hard to put into words
2040759 i think when we won the european cup last time there was a bit of an air of we cant believe this but when you win it a second time it was confirming our position in the game over a longer period
2040760 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a roadside billboard about a mile about 1 5 kilometers away with a 2 000 millimeter telephoto lens held out the window of a car moving at 50 miles 80 kilometers per hour
2040761 i need to play a little bit cleaner at times but thats to be expected
2040762 im going to get a chance to hit a few more balls hopefully ill play a little bit better
2040763 its tough to judge your opponent at night because you feel like youre a little uncomfortable and its a little unpredictable
2040764 all of the sudden its 6 2 5 2 and youre in control and theres no real pattern to the points youre reacting to what hes throwing against the wall
2040765 catholics vote largely on a set of conservative values and on social values on social values mccain has a natural advantage because of his pro life stance compared to obamas pro choice stance
2040766 this is a dominant issue in voting for catholics because of the balance of the supreme court the other issues are also important when you start thinking about the conditions in the iraq war that was a concern for catholics earlier its becoming less so so voters are turning to other more domestic concerns
2040767 weve done extensive polling of catholics over the years and its one of our specialties
2040768 the lowan electorate has a strong reliance on the agricultural sector and this decision will serve no purpose but to cause further hardship for our farming families
2040769 small towns in the electorate have been severely impacted on because of the drought and labor needs to be supporting country communities not taking people out of them
2040770 the secrecy lack of consultation and the way the decision was announced is symptomatic of the way the brumby government operates
2040771 its disappointing for both the farming and mining industries mining is also a primary industry and stawell is the largest gold mine in the state i just dont understand it
2040772 it has had a major influence on cereal breeding in australia
2040773 the department will continue to attract leading scientists to work in rural victoria by creating critical mass at consolidated centres which feature better infrastructure and services for those scientists
2040774 for instance the modern and updated facilities at the grains innovation park in horsham which has recently had a 15 million refurbishment the facilities include modern offices and laboratories with the largest plant growth facilities in dpi
2040775 the first shot was dead up at 3 oclock and it woke me up
2040776 and then there were three more shots directly behind that
2040777 selfishly im so thankful he didnt go but then you wonder what would have happened differently
2040778 never has there been something as serious as this here
2040779 the fall of nearly 20 per cent in the oil price from its recent peak coupled with a sharp fall in other commodity prices provides some optimism that inflation will start to fall later this year giving the monetary policy committee mpc scope to resume their rate cutting to try to fend off recessionary risks
2040780 the mpc will have been aware of most if not all of the content of this report and it should provide a good indication of the near term trend in bank rate
2040781 with the chancellors confirmation he is considering a temporary suspension of stamp duty the already very low number of transactions in the housing market approximately 70 per cent down on last year will diminish further until he sets out his proposals
2040782 after all who will want to commit to a property purchase now when it is probable that by waiting a few months stamp duty costs possibly running into tens of thousands of pounds can be avoided and with the chancellors blessing
2040783 borrowers who want or need the security of a fixed rate mortgage need be in no hurry to buy one but with lenders having cut some tracker rates as well current rates on the best tracker mortgages are also more attractive than a month ago especially for borrowers who dont need to borrow more than 75 per cent of their propertys value
2040784 to say that the mayor dozes off in meetings as the gentleman who sits beside her it is a complete and utter fabrication
2040785 i dont know where they got that idea im absolutely amazed

2040796 throw it down a hole and hope nothing bad happens in the 10 000 years it takes to become safe
2040797 if reprocessing is undertaken only to reduce the radioactivity level of spent fuel it should be taken into account that spent nuclear fuel becomes less radioactive over time after 40 years its radioactivity drops by 99 9
2040798 theyre really sweet they basically havent been apart for more than three seconds in the past two months
2040799 what happens when i link to many sites from my site does it affect my page rank i have a looong blogroll you know
2040800 were like kids on christmas morning we looked at every console on the market and concluded the c300 hd was the best choice
2040801 the combination of versatility ergonomics and of course the incredible sonic quality was the deciding factor a typical day in studio a may involve work on a dozen or more wildly different projects so the c300s instant resett capability is a necessity for us to help streamline our production throughput
2040802 we had a good run with our last console technology however has allowed us to shift to a completely different mode of operation and the 300 hd integrates beautifully into our daw based methodology were excited to be part of the ssl family

2040807 rest assured that i am not going to change template again
2040808 when this site was first declared as surplus by land and property services the northern ireland housing executive immediately registered their interest in acquiring the site
2040809 negotiations to finalise the purchase of the site are at an advanced stage and oaklee housing association has been appointed to develop the site once formal acquisition has taken place
2040810 the purchase of this site will allow for a much needed housing solution to be found for those in housing need in that community
2040811 its very good news especially for the many local people needing somewhere to live because the housing shortage in this area is unbelievable
2040812 itll be great for the area for the ballyduff area in particular and people across newtownabbey in general
2040813 we were previously told that building could start in 2009 or 2010 but the sooner work starts the better
2040814 john as far as we know should be back at the hotel soon
2040815 they kept him overnight hes a bit older and had a broken wrist a few bumps and scrapes but very lucky
2040816 if you could see their helmets they could have a lot more injuries than what they have theres no way anyones riding with me without a helmet
2040817 we were very lucky that it happened there and not somewhere there was a bunch of jagged rocks
2040818 when i got there i knew i had to call 911 which i did we knew they were injured we didnt know how bad but they were talking and conscious
2040819 when the ambulance attendant got there they called for another ambulance they were very good and professional const joe mitchell was there and very helpful we cant say enough about them they were excellent

2040823 the cygnus router which is currently equipped 144 x 144 is situated in the central apparatus room car with all internal and external signals being routed and monitored via the new technology
2040824 the old car was analogue while most of the islands were digital and this meant that we had to convert signals all the time this new system makes things far more operationally efficient
2040825 i built tested and installed their original pro bel router in 1986 and it is very satisfying to be able to help them upgrade to the latest technology more than 20 years later
2040826 jews should not be party to the whitewashing of such a regime kosher kitchen or no kosher kitchen

2040828 the demand for show floor space in 2009 exceeds the entire available exhibition space in the minneapolis convention center
2040829 hotel space would be problematic forcing attendees to commute to the conference center from far outside the city
2040830 we deeply regret any inconvenience that this decision has caused and understand the disappointment of the many awea member companies and supporters in the state we also deeply regret not being able to hold the windpower 2009 conference amp exhibition in a state that is one of the outstanding leaders in wind power
2040831 our community has suffered a devastating loss of more than 15 million in direct delegate spending that cannot possibly be fully mitigated within the 10 months between now and when the convention would have taken place
2040832 we have already initiated a number of aggressive short term sales initiatives to help fill our hotels and convention center with meeting business to lessen the impact of the cancellation
2040833 having a well respected qsr franchisee like bcorporation introduce krispy kreme in malaysia is an exciting opportunity
2040834 bcorporation has significant franchise experience in malaysia and we look forward to working with them to share the one of a kind krispy kreme experience with consumers there

2040840 much of what we do requires a nearly impossible turnaround time so its imperative that we have someone who can produce materials that meet our deadline
2040841 for me it is best just to think of it as a number but then i knew what to expect when i picked this number
2040842 i actually asked for number 8 at first but vic akers said that samir nasri had it so i was not complaining there
2040843 then he said number 14 was available so straight away i said ill have that
2040844 thierry was my idol he looked after me when i was first here it was brilliant to train with him every day and watch what he did he was the best striker i have ever seen
2040845 so i suppose its like ade having number 25 because kanu had that but as i say for me it is just a number
2040846 his presumption was that the opposition to barry goldwater was so extensive that deadlock was inevitable nixon figured he would resolve it as the compromise candidate
2040847 one does begin to wonder how much longer he can keep it going
2040848 four cancer scares and two broken hips among other health problems
2040849 a horrible way to show your support for a candidate
2040850 we recorded the album in two separate cities and with two different producers we made a conscious decision that we wanted to record some songs in ny and some completely different songs in berkeley california its sort of a bipolar sheen on the record
2040851 i got home and i thought i was going to chill out for a little while but i found out i had to do my taxes i was on my hands and knees in a pile of receipts on the floor
2040852 the last time i got nervous in sort of an oh my god sort of way was when we were opening for the who
2040853 we have the good fortune of having a really loyal and ever growing live fan base
2040854 its harder more than ever now for a new band to come up and get attention put on them
2040855 that pairing of songs was the greatest incapsulation of our record we had more success with that than the single the record label put out

2040862 when it comes to upgrading to a home theater pc one common complaint is that the process is too complicated and expensive the multimedia station makes that process easy convenient and affordable
2040863 these four high quality bundles include everything users need to convert their existing pc into a state of the art multimedia center
2040864 a lot of time and effort have gone into preparing for this day so were all very excited that its finally here itd be great if the local community could get behind us for what were hoping will be the first of many victories for the team
2040865 the premiership doesnt kick off for another week so were expecting a lot of liverpool fans to turn up who are just desperate to watch some competitive football after the long summer break

2040869 every single one of us has war in our geneology as asian americans and we can use that historical memory of what war did to all our countries of origin to oppose the war
2040870 whats even more about this day is the real truth behind it it didnt need to happen
2040871 yes imperial japan committed massive terror amp violence in the 1930s amp 40s amp these acts are remembered rightly so as war crimes in the us and among the international community

2040874 i tried to play it too difficult and for a while i just saw big rough and i couldnt play
2040875 the most important thing to learn at a major championship is to stay patient because they are going to test your patience
2040876 youre going to get some bad breaks youre going to hit some shots in the rough and you sometimes cant get it out i think the key is to stay patient
2040877 als je het ritme van de markt een beetje in je vingers hebt heb je een redelijk constante werkdruk maar in de bouw moet je voortdurend een aantal zeer grote projecten tegelijk draaiend zien te houden het is alsof je op twee fronten werkt zoals bij alle bedrijven moet je de strategische richting in de gaten houden maar je moet ook kunnen reageren op een snel veranderende werkomgeving
2040878 transparantie is een essentieel onderdeel van de samenwerkingen die we moeten organiseren om de meeste projecten af te kunnen leveren
2040879 maar als het tegelijkertijd zo is dat je op andere fronten met je partners moet concurreren wordt gegevensbeveiliging extra belangrijk en het gaat niet alleen om vriendelijke concurrentie het is een extreem concurrerende markt dus heb je snel inzetbare systemen nodig die het alle partijen mogelijk maken de informatie in te zien die ze nodig hebben terwijl ze dan ook echt alleen di informatie kunnen inzien die relevant is voor hun eigen project
2040880 this is not a political fundraiser its just an evening to honor a great person
2040881 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2040882 indicate your availability for any days during the next two weeks august 11th through 22nd as soon as possible
2040883 and keep building on it until the american people have been heard
2040884 this week republicans are doing nothing but pushing the failed johnny one note policies of the past
2040885 oh thank goodness we have barrels of oil coming 10 years from now
2040886 you sir and american people have nothing in common you represent big dirty oil money
2040887 pushing the failed johnny one note policies of the past
2040888 hey theres an issue here and we shouldnt really break until we make some headway
2040889 no no you guys cant get divorced you two are the ideal i have of what a perfect marriage is
2040890 you are the matriarchs and the patriarchs of this province and deserve to be treated with respect
2040891 we hope to do great things in the future as were all family people and its well known that seniors care about their own families
2040892 your organization plays a valuable role in raising public awareness and interest in the welfare of older persons in helping seniors maintain a life of dignity and independence and in educating and advising governments on the issues of older adults
2040893 of the approximately 72 000 seniors in the province more than age 65 only 26 000 have any pension income from an employer sponsored plan or personal retirement savings
2040894 of that 26 000 the total number of public service pensioners is about 10 000 this means about 64 per cent of senior citizens have no formalized pension plan income and therefore must rely on other means to live in their retirement years
2040895 we established a ministerial council on aging and seniors to ensure that programs in each government department are delivered effectively
2040896 we established a provincial advisory council on aging and seniors comprised of seniors and experts on aging to advise government on matters related to the quality of life for seniors and to facilitate public discussion on aging
2040897 i create a lot of drama and a lot of surprises
2040898 if they would have hired another actress who didnt have that background it would have been very difficult
2040899 a stunt double would have been doing most of the work because we had a limited amount of time to get together and train this is the first time ive done an action project and i want to do more because the action scenes came so easily to me
2040900 i watched people get their necks broken and their backs broken while i was there
2040901 i feel like theyre some of the most loyal fans in the entertainment business
2040902 i was to able to connect with them again to hear from them about my work on dancing with the stars through the couple of tv shows ive been on lets me know theyre following my career its a really special thing
2040903 if you want to be good at all of them you have to give 110 percent theyre all very different with wrestling youre performing to the person in the very last seat of the arena so everythings very big youre on your feet and theres a lot of improv that goes into that so theres a great dynamic with that show
2040904 i am a grown woman with a very wide eyed curiosity about the world around me regarding pop culture
2040905 we dabble in politics on the show and dabble being the operative word i love fashion make up movies and tv i love to read the enquirer and life amp style weekly i love being a woman and that its very important that this show embodies a modern woman
2040906 i think that the people who are threatened by what i say are people who might have things to hide themselves or it might startle them because they might not have come to terms with how to answer the question
2040907 one of the classic cases would be whitney houston there was no denying that whitney was apparently on something this was two weeks after the big diane sawyer interview and she clearly wasnt in her right mind either but this is years later and she is a sober woman and she is working on her new material i would love to have whitney on the show
2040908 i think that the people who are threatened by what i say are people who might have things to hide themselves or it might startle them because they might not have come to terms with how to answer the question
2040909 puffy much like whitney i guess are used to controlled interviews i find that with many celebrities particularly black celebrities its ok when cindy adams new york post gossip columnist or ted casablanca e onlines weekly gossip columnist say something but when a black journalist and i dont consider myself to be a journalist but for all intensive purposes ill say that does its beating up on a brother or sister no i am not i am commenting on in the top 15 things that are going on in pop culture right now that people care about so thats on them its not on me i am not a mean woman
2040910 in my own twisted way i even enjoyed omarosa because she brought me attention that i wasnt counting on i didnt know omarosa before the interview and i dont know her after the interview she came on with a clear agenda
2040911 my show is not a jerry springer type show its not a show of confrontation
2040912 sometimes she is married sometimes she is single sometimes she has children and sometimes she doesnt a lot of times she is a maverick in the boardroom a lot of times she just never got that jump start to her life she has flappy underarms like i do i think i represent the modern woman i happen to be a black woman but the wendy williams show is not a color thing its a thing thing
2040913 in my modern life the people that i admire are oprah i admire howard stern no womans list would be complete without oprah
2040914 she did it all while keeping her nails done some sort of sex appeal for my father and food in the house she just paved the way as a woman i think she is absolutely incredible
2040915 more so than barack i think you learn more about a man based the woman he is with id love to sit and have a great conversation with michelle obama i would take michelle obama in a heartbeat she and i are the same age
2040916 this is the time for america to see the black family i know i represent that the obamas represent that and the pinckett smiths represent that
2040917 with the statistics and so many broken homes and so many kids born out of wedlock so many black men turning to white women and visa versa i think this is the great time for the black family in america
2040918 a gray horse is as strong and runs as fast as any other horse and is probably better adapted to an environment with strong sunlight because the white coat reflects sunlight and its black skin protects from uv damage
2040919 identifying the genetic cause of the gray coat color in horses is important because 70 80 of gray horses more than 15 years of age have melanomas and reduced lifespans
2040920 we hypothesize that this genetic duplication results in the proliferation of melanocytes melanin producing cells in certain areas of the skin which predisposes gray horses to the development in melanoma
2040921 the hip hop community can play a huge roll in the 2008 election
2040922 obviously barack obama is the candidate that the hip hop community and the black community relates to the most
2040923 were finding that there are a lot of people who are very excited about the possibility of the senator as a candidate
2040924 using celebrities has always worked well particularly in communities of color
2040925 harry belafonte was there with dr king and ozzie davis and obviously muhammad ali was there with malcolm x
2040926 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton the rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
2040927 we all prayed for alana a young child has died and people should realise that as a community we should stick together and help catch who has done this
2040928 alanas father is coping but it is very hard all the family are devastated as well as the community
2040929 she was a lovely little girl i will not forget her
2040930 they are a lovely family and you could not have asked for better neighbours but it is not the same now

2040936 behind all the words senator obamas agenda can be summarized as this government is too big and he wants to grow it
2040937 taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2040938 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
2040939 to raise your taxes and spend more of your money
2040940 pretty much anything you can tax he wants to tax more
2040941 behind all the words senator obamas agenda can be summarized as this government is too big and he wants to grow it

2040943 john mccain is stepping up his efforts to characterize his rival as a say anything washington politician out of touch with the american heartland particularly on the issues of energy and taxes
2040944 if obama gets the nomination im going to vote for the candidate who left his first wife after she was disfigured in a car accident who pimped his current wife out to a crowd of bikers and who voted against equal wages for women that makes perfect sense
2040945 the off topic distractions that often spill from his mouth
2040946 mccain read the scripted remarks off a handful of note cards in line with his campaigns recent efforts to tightly control the candidates message

2040953 the president and congress should never work for their party first or rich businesses first but should always work for the people first
2040954 the democratic candidate is going to raise your taxes take away your freedom weaken the country and eat your children
2040955 pretty much anything you can tax he wants to tax more

2040996 hemlock hall is not just a place it is a state of mind it is a return to an earlier era where simple pleasures and activities such as hiking kayaking swimming or just reading a book mark the passage of time punctuated by the ringing of the dinner bell the hike to castle rock is a right of passage while not luxurious it is lovingly maintained everything is absolutely unchanged for decades including the weekly menu no stress no decisions no dinner reservations meals are served family style and seating is rotated among the tables to make sure everyone meets everyone else by the end of your stay everyone feels like an old friend there are no phones tvs computers or video games a healthy thing for overly wired kids the 100 year old manor house with a stone fireplace sits up on a hill overlooking the lake and the grounds are wooded and beautiful in the evenings board games are played while paul invites the little kids to help him bake bread something as simple as cookie night becomes an event this is a very rare and special place

2041038 ive been accused by some fans of giving vague descriptions and evasive answers to questions about tomb raider underworld and all i can say is yes guilty as charged but for good reasons
2041039 when it comes to specific features a lot of what makes this game so exciting comes down to details lots and lots of details
2041040 this flexibility is very important and so when someone asks a simple question like
2041041 this also stops me from shouting out some of the really cool details we have now and continue to add each week as we polish the game from top to bottom
2041042 i do hope to be able to give more details about tomb raider underworld in the coming weeks but when i give slippery answers please believe that i really do want you all to know everything about the game but by experiencing it yourself more than by hearing me explain it

2041050 the facts in this matter seem clear one boy killed another in a climate of intolerance and fear about sexual orientation and gender expression the alleged perpetrator who turned 14 years old less than three weeks before the shooting should be held accountable for his actions but we support the principles underlying our juvenile justice system that treat children differently than adults and provide greater hope and opportunity for rehabilitation

2041073 china has real political power in burma but has simply been unable or unwilling over the past 20 years to make a real difference
2041074 it is interesting because it is in chinas interests to promote a stable burma and frankly it is not

2041088 rsa has delivered a strong performance in canada despite challenging economic conditions and deteriorating industry results
2041089 adf gap year participants would not normally be expected to deploy on operations the time factor alone makes operational service unlikely given recruiting and initial training can take up to six months and that most operational deployments are also for six months there will not be the time for the necessary force preparation that we insist on for our deployed personnel
2041090 the key exception to this is that all navy gap year participants have the opportunity to serve at sea for approximately three months by nature an operational environment
2041091 if an adf gap year participant who is 18 years of age or older meets all of the prerequisite deployment requirements training proficiencies vaccinations and individual readiness and has sufficient adf gap year service period left to complete the deployment including all post deployment administration they may be considered for operational deployment if required
2041092 first of all it is not going to happen until it is really required
2041093 secondly it would only be possible with a three month deployment
2041094 and thirdly surely it would only be volunteers and they will be queuing up to go
2041095 the theme for this years event is response ability in marketing highlighting issues around the legislative challenges facing marketers in respect of the consumer protection bill as well as focussing on the ability of direct marketing to deliver a clear measurable response through one on one communications
2041096 legislative challenges have had a serious impact on how the direct marketing industry conducts its business and has positively impacted on the industry by getting direct marketers to up their game and think out of the box which they have done with extraordinary results
2041097 we are looking forward to seeing what the industry has been up to in the past year in addition to measuring our results against our global counterparts in anticipation of this we have managed to secure three international judges to deliver their verdicts and have established a virtual judging forum consisting of andy owen dma uk alastair tempest fedma and pieter van den busken idn as part of our assegai judging team this year
2041098 we are aiming to attract 250 entries this year and have also invited 56 dmas across the world to participate overall the direct marketing industry and players have been through some tough times on the legislative front making these awards a real display of direct marketers with staying power creativity and award winning talent
2041099 during the past year we completed a rigorous internal review to determine how we can gain efficiencies and accelerate response times to evolving opportunities in the medical and security marketplaces
2041100 early in the fourth quarter we reorganized our engineering staff to increase efficiency optimize the allocation of resources and enhance communications throughout our entire engineering organization

2041110 i along with bnei akiva am shocked and disgusted at this attack this is unfortunately another sign of anti semitism and fundamentalism at work in israel and we must do everything in our power to eradicate these problems
2041111 world bnei akiva stands in solidarity with our members and friends in the pisgat zeev branch in jerusalem following the vandalism there at the weekend
2041112 we are working hard to make sure everything comes together this weekend and there is a lot to do but it will be worth it to see the childrens smiling faces
2041113 there isnt much entertainment for children in this area so we decided that it would be good to get the carnival back up and running
2041114 with it being so long since the last one it will be well supported
2041115 the community spirit in moss bay is immense and whenever something is put on then the whole community comes together
2041116 it will be great to see people lining the streets that havent entered a float but are just there to support what we are doing here
2041117 i am delighted to have an opportunity to welcome such a large number of new international students just as the beijing olympic games begin
2041118 the presence of so many new chinese students here today demonstrates the strong bonds that have grown between the university of ulster and china
2041119 the university has been a home from home for many of their compatriots over recent years and today we extend a warm ulster welcome as we share in their national pride as the olympic games open in spectacular style in bejing setting the scene for a successful paralympic games too in september
2041120 the university has its olympic and paralympic success stories sports scholar and melanie nocher is on the irish swim team for the olympics and michael mckillop who is on the staff of the sports centre in jordanstown will run in the 800 metres in the paralympic games we wish them every success
2041121 i am delighted to join in the celebrations to mark this momentous occasion of the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics
2041122 this will be a unique opportunity for northern ireland to showcase our quality sporting venues and facilities in ni the offering will include a wide range of sports support services whilst the athletes are acclimatising and training to participate in what will be the biggest show in town in the summer of 2012
2041123 you cant offer a first year college undergrad facing huge student loans 25 000 and expect her to really contemplate the risks
2041124 and what will happen later if they have difficulty conceiving a child after theyve donated their eggs to science instead of saving them for themselves
2041125 the idea is that if a woman is paid enough theres a point at which she may not pay attention to the risks
2041126 the consensus has pretty much been to err on the side of caution
2041127 i think its outrageous that anyone would tell a woman she cant make her own decision
2041128 embryonic stem cell research is where weve made the most headway
2041129 we shouldnt just jump out on another limb without very good reason

2041139 todays volatile markets and increasingly strict regulatory environments make this an opportune time to add dcgs capabilities to our trm practice
2041140 regulatory scrutiny has resulted in new demands on clients to maintain compliance and reduce the risk associated with the growing complexity and volumes of these transactions our trm practice is already well established and this move will bolster our opportunities both in the current uncertain times and in future growth markets trm and our interactive services represent the fastest growing parts of our business
2041141 given the growth in this area clients are looking to partner with firms that can help them define and manage their derivative processes from start to finish this allows them to reduce costs while strengthening their ability to respond to the regulatory and compliance demands associated with complex derivatives trading and processing
2041142 from the desire to depict a place and a tragedy that still today represents a void and a question for europe
2041143 the local people call them ching ching because thats the sound that they make
2041144 no one knows for sure why they come it could be for our delicious cheeseburgers in paradise or our great margaritas
2041145 but i think its really simply because they now have nowhere to go
2041146 they used to all nest in the big trees up and down this area but someone has been cutting down the trees recently along the port area were not sure why they are taking the trees down but some people heard that they might be putting in more parking lots
2041147 the main reason is that we have been chopping down so many trees in george town and so the birds now have nowhere to go
2041148 we do have a tree protection law but it is pretty useless and even when developers do break the law they only have to pay a fine of about 500 which of course does not deter anyone from chopping down a perfectly beautiful tree
2041149 they started to show up about six weeks ago and now they are regular visitors
2041150 ive been attacked at least once they came swooping down and tried to peck at me they have nests here and maybe they think you are invading their territory
2041151 dont it always seem to go that you dont know what you got till its gone they paved paradise and put up a parking lot
2041152 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2041153 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2041154 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2041155 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2041156 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2041157 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2041158 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2041159 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2041160 we have long made the point that it is not a question of onshore or offshore it is a question of sound or weak regulation and we are delighted that the imf has recognised this
2041161 the distinction between offshore financial centres and other financially active jurisdictions has been blurred by globalisation which has increased the range of cross border transactions and intermediation in many countries as well as by the active efforts of a number of countries to build or promote offshore business
2041162 we have a robust regulatory system and as the recent ipoc case proves we will take action if there is non compliance
2041163 adopting a unified approach would blunt concerns that jurisdictions are being unduly targeted while also underscoring the expectation that offshore financial centres should meet commonly agreed international standards
2041164 we hope that the imfs recognition that this distinction should end will now extend to other international bodies and regulatory organisations

2041177 i am convinced the frustration we got by not winning it last season will come out for good
2041178 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time
2041179 we have kept the basis of the team this season ok we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
2041180 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief
2041181 chelsea have made a formal proposal to real madrid for robinho i do not know the amount but the offer has been made
2041182 robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of real madrid have behaved towards him
2041183 he calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and i have to tell him that i have received no calls
2041184 i have spent three days trying to speak with some of the directors at madrid but they have all disappeared
2041185 robinho does not understand anything he wants to be one of the best players in the world but at real madrid he cannot achieve that because they treat him like a normal player
2041186 he has liked nothing about the way that real madrid have gone about their transfer activity this summer
2041187 robinhos plan has been to play for real madrid for many years and then go back to santos where is he going to find a better club than real madrid

2041191 as a working farmer and horse owner i felt it important to speak out for these magnificent animals who have played such an important role in the lives of african american farmers
2041192 when learning about the issue people advocating horse slaughter kept saying horse slaughter is an important industry to famers and horse owners i had to take a stand and tell congress this was just not true
2041193 the industry exists out of greed and those advocating horse slaughter could care less about horse welfare
2041194 even if horses were being abandoned that has nothing to do with slaughter and we certainly shouldnt be collecting info on it to defend horse slaughter we should go after those abusing animals not reward them
2041195 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations
2041196 investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
2041197 the narrative of the song is supposed to be more broad than my own personal experience but having crohns disease for most of my life certainly figures in to the storyline considerably
2041198 i am supposed to be made to feel like a patient but instead i feel like a target market for whichever pharmacological contrivance is being pushed this week anyone who has ever been treated for depression should be able to relate to the molten rage and resentment that occurs when you realize that your drug therapies are not only keeping you from feeling depressed they are also keeping you from feeling human
2041199 if you happen to be into the history of psychology dr menninger and the hospital that bore his name are pretty notable my grandfather was actually a student of dr menninger and worked out there for a few years back when sociopaths were still being given lobotomies and getting smothered to death with their pillows by big native americans
2041200 you can make a volcano with baking soda and vinegar
2041201 do the bubbles mean that water is kind of like vinegar
2041202 do you know that when i was i kid we used to make paste from flour and water
2041203 but the soy flour doesnt taste anything like the baking soda

2041207 what struck me was the complete depth of microsoft software that the updates will touch this month
2041208 the bug could be a cross over to multiple programs
2041209 it will be a different kind of work this month
2041210 the potential for downtime is a little less for one thing if a single laptop fails because it didnt get its ie patch thats not so bad as last month when an exchange server could have gone down after patching
2041211 es ist lobenswert dass microsoft vermehrt auf eine offene kommunikationspolitik in bezug auf informationssicherheit setzt

2041213 most modern asians would not know what that means but for many traditional asians it has a lot of cultural significance

2041231 at the moment and at this level there is no movement within opec to do anything
2041232 i dont think ministers will change output i think at less than 80 for opec oil maybe they would do something
2041233 exactly as they didnt think they could control the pace and magnitude on the upside they dont think they can control the downside so they may overshoot if they draw a line in the sand at say 100
2041234 maybe at below 105 they might do something they wont want to see the price below 90
2041235 anxiety is the acute response to unpredicted events when one doesnt control things that happen around them a kasam bomb arrives and you can barely find a cover in order to rescue your life the body is in a constant stress at some point the body gives up and resorts to apathy and depression here i come in and with my hands adjust the nervous system and the brain stem and reinsert new energy to the system
2041236 i put my fingers in the region of the brain stem where i find problematic points of interference and no nerve communication asserts minimal pressure and ask the client to take full 3 breaths and than actually the breathing system that is being adjusted by me release the interference and the nervous system begins to correct itself so with the touch of hand in the right places of the brain stem that release the interferences that have been created over the years and the treated feels major relief
2041237 we are still learning about circumcision and how much we should focus on it
2041238 the evidence is overwhelming that it reduces the risk of hiv infection and we have examined theological texts and found no opposition to it but we are a little unsure how the church would react to such a huge campaign
2041239 we have to make sure people understand that this is no magic bullet abstinence and faithfulness are still the only sure ways to protect against this virus
2041240 i dont see any reason that people should throw away their condoms if they were circumcised
2041241 but the evidence is that hiv infections would drop sharply whatever they did
2041242 it can be difficult to get the message to some tribes that they should abandon their practice of circumcising females but they should start a new practice of circumcising males
2041243 the church is opposed to condoms so circumcision is appealing
2041244 but cutting off peoples body parts is a far worse tactic
2041245 katrina is the perfect representation of the young trendy and fashionable woman that nakshatra targets nakshatra is synonymous with trust and purity in a category that is fraught with questionable practices it epitomizes the expression of love and affection in a womens life not only were we enthusiastic about the brand fit but we feel that katrina lends a refreshing look to the brand we are excited about having her on board as the new face for nakshatra
2041246 i am delighted to be associated with a brand like nakshatra that has garnered immence popularity not only in india but worldwide i hope this association is amiable and mutually profitable

2041254 the connection between religious engagement and political attitudes appears to be especially strong when it comes to hot button social issues such as abortion and homosexuality
2041255 suggests that the efforts of democrats to peel away republican and conservative voters based on economic issues face a real limit because of the role these cultural issues play

2041258 i was inspired to found obopay when i was volunteering in africa and saw that while people in remote corners of the world often lacked access to the most basic financial services they almost all had mobile phones
2041259 we are thrilled to embark on a partnership with grameen solutions and look forward to working with them to bring truly powerful mobile banking services to people everywhere
2041260 we carefully evaluated globally available mobile money service providers with a view to identifying a partner that fits with our vision and mission obopay is clearly that partner and we look forward to maximizing the global potential of mobile financial services with them by using a technology that is already pervasive the mobile phone we will clearly be able to have a dramatic impact on global poverty
2041261 obopays partnership with grameen solutions is a clear and powerful validation of obopays ability to have a dramatic and transformational global impact on personal finance
2041262 mobile based financial services will bring more power to poor people im excited about the partnership that grameen solutions and obopay have created
2041263 one of my goals this year has been to broaden the appeal of our common reading so that it is not seen merely as an intersections assignment
2041264 you know every second that passes that shes not here we cant even begin to think about celebrating im going to go get her a card today i already got her a whole closet full of presents which wont mean anything unless she can get a hug from any of us and see our faces again and i know that will be our joy and the best gift she can have
2041265 keep in mind this is an ongoing case and anything is possible and were leaving all the avenues open but were going down these avenues to look for little caylee and were trying to find her
2041266 im portrayed as someone who is hiding something if i was hiding something i wouldnt have made the 911 calls i wouldnt have invited these people to my house i wouldnt have called them this morning to come to my house this morning for things that ive discovered in my house that i remembered oh my god this might help you guys find caylee so put the speculation aside
2041267 it seems like when more of a community comes together as one were like family and it can grow more and more and the word gets out there and they can just post flyers everywhere to just bring caylee home
2041268 the company with all diligence has attempted to avoid a bankruptcy filing however the filing became necessary because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 billion of debt may soon be in default

2041272 while foreign competitors were investing in more fuel efficient technology for their vehicles american automakers were spending their time investing in bigger faster cars the auto industry is on a path that is unacceptable and unsustainable and america must take action to make it right

2041275 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis yeah its mutt williams and the search for elvis
2041276 it really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2041277 so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for indiana jones to chase
2041278 id much prefer to see a mutt williams spin off adventure next instead
2041279 if youre scared you cant do it just wont work
2041280 no one knew it so that was a bit of a worry
2041281 he was a younger bull that hadnt been bucking in the pbr before
2041282 but he bucked good he was a little bit tough
2041283 id never ridden in the pbr but id done all right in the apra
2041284 theres a fair few rodeos around our area but theyre not as big as these ones
2041285 he has been fairly co operative with them and has participated in interviews and has told them everything he could and has been very clear in that interview that he isnt able to remember what happened with the motorbike or the subsequent car
2041286 the only recollection he has that i know of which is clear is having people trying to cut him out of the car
2041287 he has been spoken to and asked what he remembers and what he thinks happened but as far as someone telling him what actually took place i dont think so
2041288 obviously someone at the scene of the accident told him there had been a motorcyclist and another vehicle involved but i dont know if anyone has in fact told him exactly what happened
2041289 he has the reaction you would expect from someone who has been involved in an accident like this
2041290 he is good as he could be and has expressed great remorse for what happened and is very sad for the family and the young girl and indeed for the motorbike rider
2041291 the charge that he has got is to do with leaving the scene of an accident
2041292 we havent been given the benefit of seeing the video but from what we understand he hit a motorcyclist and then crossed the road and drove into oncoming traffic
2041293 thats an odd way to try to leave the scene of an accident
2041294 they have given him what is really a holding charge to keep him in court and keep him in town while they continue to investigate
2041295 he has been undergoing medical examinations since he has been in hospital and he continues to undergo those

2041300 look excuse me i cannot discuss the matter with you because you are presupposing things that dont exist or exist only in your imagination

2041310 in 2003 mccain and his campaign manager rick davis then a lobbyist helped push through the senate a merger between foreign owned dhl and a domestic company that brought the hub and its many jobs to wilmington reports the cleveland plain dealer
2041311 in 2003 mccain campaign manager rick davis lobbied congress to accept a proposal by german owned dhl to buy airborne express which kept its domestic hub in wilmington in southwest ohio
2041312 if obama gets the nomination im going to vote for the candidate who left his first wife after she was disfigured in a car accident who pimped his current wife out to a crowd of bikers and who voted against equal wages for women that makes perfect sense
2041313 democrats are calling on mccain to use his past links to the company to help save the thousands of jobs at stake
2041314 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2041315 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2041316 people do you shorthand and say ok this is you know eminem rapping over a cake track if i thought we really sounded like that wed just stop and let eminem and cake get together but if people need to do that to describe how we sound thats fine thats the first step

2041343 the state of texas is spending more than 88 million a year to provide community college students remedial education according to a report released tuesday
2041344 never mind that property values increase every year mostly because local districts are continually forced by the state to raise property taxes

2041349 in countries without laws to protect sex workers drug users and men who have sex with men only a fraction of the population has access to prevention
2041350 conversely in countries with legal protection and the protection of human rights for these people many more have access to services as a result there are fewer infections less demand for antiretroviral treatment and fewer deaths
2041351 we trust in this method because we have good examples
2041352 we are not only promoting the prevention of aids but also promoting and practicing a culture of tolerance and fighting discrimination
2041353 we hope to have many of our dealers and international distributors web order ready as of september and really see this as a huge opportunity for both our valued dealers and for eastern bikes the time savings for dealers as well as the ability to order at their convenience should prove invaluable especially during what should be an exceptionally busy holiday time on our side of things the online ordering capability should free up time for our sales staff to go after some great opportunities in the marketplace
2041354 i cannot express how excited i am to help elevate eastern bikes position as a bmx brand and as a go to distributor eastern has been constantly improving for years now and were really gaining focus and renewed energy with these changes theres a lot more to come from eastern bikes
2041355 the enterprise risk management market is really in its infancy and it is the opportunity to help shape its evolution which has brought me to strategic thought businesses are starting to recognize the need to move from a compliance view of risk management which is merely a cost to the business to a risk reward model risk reward not only mitigates risks to help reduce for example the cost of insurance and credit but also allows a company to actively manage its portfolio of opportunities and go after more business with greater confidence
2041356 we continue to view charlotte as an important location for tiaa cref

2041359 the good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals
2041360 it is inevitable that more borrowers coping strategies will come under pressure in current conditions than in the unusually benign years of the last decade
2041361 thats why lenders government and the advice sector are working closely together to minimise the impact on borrowers
2041362 the number of repossessions seems set to rise significantly further over the coming months as there are a plethora of factors that will damage households financial positions
2041363 these pressures include the squeeze on purchasing power coming from sharply rising utility bills and elevated food prices higher mortgage payments for many people increasingly rising unemployment ongoing tight credit conditions and muted disposable income growth
2041364 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
2041365 this contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and for such the controller should be commended for his actions
2041366 in spite of global economic uncertainty and rising inflation outbound travel in asia pacific is poised for steady growth over the rest of 2008 this is largely due to the fact than income and employment have not been seriously affected by the global credit crunch and higher inflation has yet to translate into higher prices in plane tickets and costs of accommodation should these conditions change however the outlook will be very different

2041378 building consumer trust in retail payments laying a solid foundation
2041379 a poorly resolved fraud event can create ripples that travel far beyond the original consumer customers need to feel confident that their transactions and data are being handled safely and securely
2041380 while payments providers depend upon trust to help secure and build consumer relationships it is often an overlooked unmeasured and to a great extent unmanaged asset even though it is ranked as the no 1 customer concern sound management needs to be based on an understanding of what drives trust the costs and benefits of investing in trust and the actions institutions can take to build trust they need to have a plan of action
2041381 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be

2041394 i think it reinforces the fact that arguments against extradition had no merit and that he is continuing to avoid the inevitable
2041395 it is a very significant intrusion case because it reinforces the fact that a lone individual who is motivated can cause significant damage to the military preparedness of this country it showed unfortunately that security on computers at military installations was not as robust as it should have been if thats in fact true it gives one concern as to what organised groups with sophisticated hacking tools who may be sponsored by organised crime or foreign governments could achieve in this area
2041396 when these things take place you never know till the very end what their motivation is you dont know if its a nation state or a terrorist group you have to work it as if this was the most important case you ever worked there is a finite amount of resources this pulled big resources that could have been used for other things
2041397 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days
2041398 it would show him to be much more deliberate methodical and vindictive than otherwise
2041399 i would imagine that the government is going to try to show that hes not this eccentric but that he is using that as his cover story where his real motivation is attacking the government and the military because of u s policies regardless of his explanation he still shouldnt have accessed computers and been rummaging around and doing what he was doing
2041400 it appears he has acknowledged gaining unauthorised access to these military computer networks but it also appears that he does not believe he caused any damage in the course of his rooting around these computer systems
2041401 i dont think this case is a home run the government will need to demonstrate that he caused damage which may not be the easiest thing to prove the government through mckinnons admissions is halfway to the goal line but still has a ways to go
2041402 that doesnt wash for me anytime you create an unauthorised entry point it means not only one person could have used it to get into the system who else could have used it to piggyback into the system

2041417 how to reduce biological risks and to enhance preparedness and response
2041418 identify concrete actions which need to be taken in prevention of threats to human beings by biological agents and toxins
2041419 consider developing guidelines for minimum training requirements for persons working with having access to or handling biological agents and toxins at eu level based on the national experience across the eu 27
2041420 in conjunction with university and professional associations consider development of minimal requirements for academic training in bio safety on potential misuse of information and agents and on bio ethics for undergraduate graduate and postgraduate students
2041421 a scientific advisory panel for the biological and toxin weapons convention as an element in the web of prevention
2041422 in this particular case this is an endangered species therefore it is a little more precious to our community
2041423 there was some good some bad but ultimately we still lost the game
2041424 offensively all the quarterbacks did engineer a scoring drive and thats a positive defensively there was a fourth down stop we stopped them at the end to give the ball back to the offense and give us a chance to win we did too many things that caused us to lose
2041425 they threw the ball over our heads twice for two big plays and that will kill you
2041426 maybe it helps that way focuses on the pain more than oh i need to hole this putt and i dont want to make a double or make a bogey
2041427 you just follow the process and routine and you make the putt for par or birdie

2041438 expects chief officers and chief financial officers of all government entities to give the highest priority to quick progress towards meeting the requirements of the law and of financial accountability
2041439 a short hiatus would give both ministers and the general public greater confidence that such senior officials continued to be motivated by the national interest rather than personal ambition so if this issue is raised in constitutional talks i hope both sides will be prepared to look at it with an open mind
2041440 i am pleased to report that cabinet has now looked at those recommendations of the commission that require legislation and or a decision by cabinet
2041441 ministers are of the view that it is important that directors of boards have the confidence of the government of the day and therefore could be changed by a new government
2041442 the governor is chairman of the cabinet and the line manager for the portfolios
2041443 the governor has every expectation that the wheels will turn and the changes will be made
2041444 there are actually very few cases where civil servants are barred from standing for elections but there are procedures for declaring themselves
2041445 i recognise that restrictions on a small category of senior civil servants standing for elected office would present real issues legal and practical c ivil servants can have a lot to offer if elected to the legislative assembly
2041446 there is a problem getting people on boards because they are not remunerated and either party might be uncomfortable with members of the opposition on those boards
2041447 provided that other measure are taken to ensure that directors understand and observe their responsibilities it is in the interests of both members of boards and the country that they are clear about the need to avoid conflict of interest
2041448 we have seen a lot of people up there nevis 2 our security guard handles most of the in betweens stuff and the people who want to come see the location so stop and see the security guard if you are coming up they will bring you up and show you around the location
2041449 during culturama in the last three or four days i guess people were off work we have seen a tremendous amount of people up there asking a lot of questions what we are doing when we think it will be online where is the plant going what is the pad for why did we dig the pond typical questions from the public that have a lot of interest their reactions have been very good they are all smiles and are waiting to see the productivity come along
2041450 we have seen an increase now in the temperature of the formation right now the same relationship that we saw in nevis 1 which is about 10 15 degrees fahrenheit per 100 feet it actually came in a little lower than nevis 1 because we think the elevation difference between nevis 1 and nevis 2 things are going very good things are going very well and we expect to be done somewhere in the next two to three weeks the end of august
2041451 we are actually a little ahead of the last one based on the fact that we are doing a different drilling programme we did have a few problems in this well we had some steel we had to drill out that slowed us down but actually the production right now is going very very well

2041467 i felt that if he is voted into office the world will change
2041468 he was electrified infected with a new political bug and he said that he now intends to become politically involved for the first time in his life
2041469 wise policy would have crowned and fortified the weimar republic with a constitutional sovereign in the person of an infant grandson of the kaiser under a council of regency instead a gaping void was opened in the national life of the german people
2041470 the weimar republic with all its liberal trappings and blessings was regarded as an imposition of the enemy it could not hold the loyalties or the imagination of the german people
2041471 and into that void after a pause there strode a maniac of ferocious genius the repository and expression of the most virulent hatreds that have ever corroded the human breast corporal hitler
2041472 while not unaware of their own history the generation of 25 year olds feels far less inhibited by it than its predecessors
2041473 the younger generation is no longer susceptible to older germans instinctive aversion to passionate politicians on the contrary young germans yearn for someone to inspire them instead of simply telling them what to do
2041474 germany inevitably would emerge as the leader of a united europe
2041475 all europe is actually ready just waiting for the confidence inspiring leader an international all european hitler and it is on the way that man is there somewhere
2041476 the world appears bereft of great men but a world recognized strong man in all probability will now very soon appear there will be 10 ruling 10 nations or groups of nations in the area of the once great holy roman empire but there will be one super king over the 10
2041477 soon germany will be ruled by a man more cunning and deceitful than adolf hitler

2041479 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008

2041484 i am genuinely excited by this project london 2012 provides enormous opportunities for the industry not just in london but in every part of the uk and this will give business tourism an even greater voice over the next four years and beyond

2041491 defence expenditure worldwide is being sustained by the continuing high level of international tension
2041492 the global nature of the threats continues to drive expenditure on those capabilities that allow the projection of military effects and the protection of personnel around the world
2041493 a key part of modern warfare and counter terrorism is the maintenance of information superiority this in turn drives continued strong demand for battlespace it equipment that can provide enhanced communications bandwidth and capacity

2041673 approximately 15 bags of food were missing from the food pantry
2041674 she went upstairs and could see the front door was ajar
2041675 we went through the building and nothing appeared to be missing or out of place
2041676 i believe someone has a key because during the july 24 incident the door had not been forced in
2041677 i asked the staff and they indicated they didnt come in to the building the only other option was someone has a key i think nothing was broken in terms of the entry point

2041692 making full use of our search authorities with respect to items like notebooks and backpacks while failing to do so with respect to laptops and other devices would ensure that terrorists and criminals receive less scrutiny at our borders just as their use of technology is becoming more sophisticated
2041693 an all invasive approach that treats everyone like a suspect is not a smart trade off for the miniscule chance that well catch a break like that identifying a criminal

2041718 it is very humbling to be elected a member of this select group of individuals who are considered to be at the top of the engineering profession in nigeria
2041719 this is even more so since the nigerian academy of engineering is one of the most active and prestigious academies in sub saharan africa it also reaffirms our efforts to help build the capacity to train world class engineers for sub saharan africa using a partnership vehicle between penn state and select african universities including quite a few in nigeria this recognition is both a personal affirmation and a corporate one for penn states strategy for engagement in nigeria
2041720 one way i can do so is by joining the lecture tour that nae is planning fellows will be campaigning to popularize science engineering and technology in the rural areas of nigeria thirty six states of the federation are expected to be covered in this lecture tour
2041721 i will also work to uphold naes objectives through my work here at penn state currently i am supporting the building of strategic partnerships between penn state and select african universities some of which are in nigeria
2041722 forging such cross cultural academic partnerships will both facilitate the exchange of ideas and advance engineering science education practice and technology and related disciplines achieving both of naes main objectives
2041723 the conventional wisdom is that an entrepreneur sees an opportunity comes up with a business plan to capitalize on it determines the capital that needs to be raised raises the capital and then applies it to building the business described in the business plan
2041724 in reality its likely that some of your initial assumptions are pretty good and others arent going to be worth the paper theyre written on
2041725 you could start that way and write a business plan based on that amount
2041726 but maybe youd be better off renting a stand and testing what the demand is for your products at that location
2041727 with this you can fund your business on a cycle by cycle basis
2041728 when you go for the second cycle and for expanding your business the numbers are now based not on focus groups or surveys but on real world experience
2041729 small business owners may under price their product or service thinking they have to come in at the lowest price point to compete
2041730 mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis incidental human pathogen or public health threat
2041731 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy phd ceo of sequella inc
2041732 since among other things multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of cd patients treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms
2041733 the democrats cant even pick a nominee right and they want to lead the country
2041734 why did i start running for president i got hit on the head with a rock
2041735 when i woke up id made my announcement and then it was too late no im teasing
2041736 will they eventually desert this sinking ship to save their own credibility
2041737 it is unwise to leave a live dragon out of your calculations
2041738 dont let the republicans get away with taking the nomination away from obama
2041739 no matter what happens hurricane hillary is forming as we speak when and if she makes landfall who knows what will happen
2041740 there are a lot of moving parts for this to work
2041741 id only have a stomache ache with her as president as opposed to the ulcer with obama mccain is a soar throat
2041742 if obama doesnt win this will be the end of the democrat ic party
2041743 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere
2041744 as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds
2041745 some of the fairways really kick one way or the other it takes a few rounds to really get to know a course
2041746 i was hitting the ball really well and i feel like i am putting the ball better now
2041747 i was 1 down with a few to go and i needed to make a move sometime
2041748 on 16 i have good feelings about that hole i really like it i hadnt holed anything really today and i had an 8 meter putt and i just felt really good about it and it went straight in so that got me going
2041749 im really happy with myself that i could come back in the end and just never give up
2041750 thats perfect because we are like the three best friends said ciganda about reaching the quarterfinals with her two compatriots
2041751 they are like my best friends so i am happy for them and thats really nice we are having a lot of fun thats great to be the three of us here
2041752 based on the law 9 610 which establishes the payment of 3 000 times the value of each pirated unit seized the judge decided for a fine of 400mn reais per owner plus the compensation for the 71 745 units seized which add up to 7bn reais
2041753 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our health care system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
2041754 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
2041755 i just feel and i always practiced this that when anyone had anything they wanted to discuss they could discuss it
2041756 things that the board as a body wouldnt even begin to take seriously
2041757 he was the most disruptive board member i ever served with
2041758 robert croom an assistant director for the south carolina association of counties said the bigger the body the more procedural rules to keep the flow of business orderly
2041759 the boards policy on its meeting agenda came up for revision at its most recent meeting and it prompted discussion about whether the four member requirement was a good rule
2041760 its staggering that were happy to spend near enough 1m on sending politicians who may not be in office by 2012 and officials to beijing but deny on the grounds of economy any extra funding to visitbritain in order to promote londons games in 2012
2041761 if thats the case the private partners will be looking for some serious commitment and resources from the public sector which on the evidence so far is precisely what we dont have
2041762 this only highlights its obstinate refusal to take tourism seriously and emphasises the need for the tourism alliances campaign to urge the government to adopt a more positive approach to this important industry
2041763 we hammered out jingles that will be seen along the yard crawls path for people to enjoy while traveling from town to town looking for bargains
2041764 representatives from the two frederick county towns have volunteered to put up the signs in that area
2041765 this is a chance for a great collaborative effort to support the yard crawl and our destination
2041766 the yard crawl gives shenandoah county residents a way to be entrepeneurs themselves
2041767 most recently weve begun sponsoring two local events the yard crawl this coming weekend and the shenandoah valley musicfest
2041768 the new look will help tremendously when people are choosing a travel destination
2041769 status to the pilgrimage church of m riabesny pest county reports 168ora hu
2041770 his current status is it looks like hes going to be ineligible so hes last team
2041771 i dont know if theyll appeal it or whatever and if they do and if thats granted then he might move up from there but right now were not going to waste reps on him until we know something
2041772 im just very excited about what i can do and what the team can do for me im just ready to make it happen academically and on the field
2041773 even though hamby was named the starter coming out of spring theyre still going to equal up the reps and i dont know whos going to come out of camp as the starter
2041774 this means that if for example a backhoe sliced through a telecommunications cable running into one of tabcorps 4 000 sites the affected data traffic would automatically switch over to the next g wireless network
2041775 ill take you to the candy shop fastlane dvd review
2041776 fiecare om trebuie sa creada in ceva eu cred ca o sa mai beau un paharel
2041777 numai dupa invidia altora iti dai seama de propria ta valoare
2041778 hes going to be out there to greet the people of hawaii and to tell them how much he appreciates their support
2041779 impressive i would not have watched golf in this kind of weather
2041780 it was fun to see so many people out there today and that so many of them stayed on the course after all it took us five hours to complete the round
2041781 ive had more bogeys than birdies in the last two and half months so this was really nice you have to be patient in this kind of weather its difficult to keep the grips dry but the greens were superb and i putted extremely well
2041782 if they cant help me can they cancel all my servic
2041783 these unthinkable tragedies are happening most often in the driveway of the childs home in 70 of the incidents the driver of the vehicle is the parent grandparent aunt uncle or older sibling of the victim
2041784 it is a tragic occurrence whenever a child is hurt or killed in a vehicle accident
2041785 the fact that a parent or other close relative is often involved compounds the tragedy our goal is to make the back up camera technology that can help avoid these tragedies affordable to more families
2041786 theyve been a bit of a bogey team in the past but helensburgh beat them in the quarter finals so maybe thats an omen
2041787 helensburgh are just below us in the league so at least were up against familiar faces this time
2041788 but maybe well have better luck than we did at marress last month when we skittled them out for 112 and were siting on 104 for four when the heavens opened and the match was abandoned
2041789 its always been my ambition to win a national competition and i think weve got a real chance this time round it wont be easy but hopefully we can do it
2041790 what happened last year is in the past and sunday is not about me
2041791 its about putting irvine cricket club on the map and showing people that were winners and not the cricketing equivalent of dundee united
2041792 maybe in the past weve treated it as a bit of a day out and let the occasion get to us
2041793 but this time round everyones really focussed and if we can get our strongest xi on the field im sure we can do it
2041794 its amazing when you think that a guy like drew parsons whos won all those international caps has never won a national trophy either and were all determined to do it for him
2041795 hes such a big influence on the team as is this years professional krishna arjune who hit an unbeaten 105 in the semi final
2041796 but were strong in attack too where sunis also good with the ball and derek and drew are vastly experienced
2041797 the limited over game suits them and it also allows to exploit the bowling talents of ewan morrison and ruchin filander to the full
2041798 everyone says that this time its got to be different and were not going to let the occasion get to us
2041799 were going to stirling to win the result is all that matters and if we play well thats a bonus

2041804 prosperity is just around the corner with a car in every garage and a chicken in every pot
2041805 i actually played well i just had basically a train wreck on three holes
2041806 i really didnt have any bogeys except for the doubles so thats going to put you back a few i fought back which is great but a few things could have gone a little better
2041807 i was really nervous for the whole week and a half leading up to it
2041808 i have never really had to qualify to play in an event and if i hadnt qualified it would have cut my trip short it was really relieving when i qualified
2041809 nothing was working for me it was hard to get my confidence back but i took that score out of me and it was good to get it out i guess i just worked on a few things to get a few things back in line
2041810 the body appears to have suffered homicidal violence but we just need confirmation from the medical examiners office
2041811 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2041812 whether that is successful or not is of course an open questio
2041813 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualtyis more significant than any other
2041814 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2041815 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2041816 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2041817 my house burned everything is burned my birds my parakeets everything my clothes my kids clothes everything it was a perfect storm they said
2041818 my dad said the house is burning and we got out and went over here the tree got on fire and the tree fell on the back of our house
2041819 the house thats on fire right now is a big family and the one next to it i believe is an older couple
2041820 the conditions the way they are in proximity they were rocking when we arrived
2041821 we send the highest number of people to the hospital for asthma every year we also suffer from heart conditions lung problems and cancer and all of those health problems are very much related to the environmental pollution that we breathe in the air every day
2041822 weve asked for the city to keep trucks away from schools homes playgrounds elder centers
2041823 were thankful for the rain several areas got very little were hoping we will get more tonight
2041824 some areas got about half an inch maybe a little more some areas have received a quarter inch or less prior to that we were in really bad shape as far as drought conditions for a couple of weeks things deteriorate a lot faster than they normally do because of the extreme temperatures some areas hadnt had rainfall for four weeks until today
2041825 we will do fine on hay if we have enough moisture not to have to feed hay early overall were in pretty good shape because of early rainfall pastures and hay have gotten short over the last two weeks but if we can get some more rainfall theyll pick back up
2041826 corn is pretty well made were going to have a pretty decent corn crop if we had one more rainfall we would have had a bumper crop
2041827 the soybeans we planted early are good the soybeans planted after wheat harvest mid to late june are the ones we have problems with they were small plants and when we got the hot weather it really took its toll they didnt have a very good root system yet because they were young plants six to eight inches tall they started dying because of lack of moisture and extreme heat
2041828 its too late for them to do much this rain will help whats left but because the plants died we lost our yield
2041829 our cattle are in good condition going into this part of the summer probably better than normal
2041830 some of the rice got difficult to water during the 100 degree weather but its better today we had to speed our pumps up and burn more fuel to keep it wet we had some fields we just barely had enough water to keep it all wet if it cools down from here on well be in good shape
2041831 last year we got flooded and lost about half our rice and 80 percent of our soybeans this year so far we havent lost anything much the water was real high all spring and we kept thinking we were going to lose it it finally quit raining and the water went down
2041832 maybe it will all work out we really need to make a crop
2041833 its been a fairly cool summer until this last week i hope it keeps raining a little bit if it doesnt go through another dry spell between here and harvest well be all right
2041834 to change the world one child and one community at a time
2041835 its very special to be a charter member of a club
2041836 people are going to look back on this through the years and your names will be there
2041837 the important things we do are not in our meetings but in our projects
2041838 dont ever forget that our mission is to serve the children
2041839 but some of us are on fire and we are ready to go
2041840 sometimes youll have an animal in a car and youll run in really quickly to get coffee thinking itll be five minutes then there might be a long line or youll run into a friend and before you know it its been 20 minutes when even five minutes is too long for an animal to be left in a car
2041841 unless the vehicle is running and the air conditioner is running properly
2041842 it does matter because they cool their body down by panting
2041843 theres no legislation i know of right now in arkansas i do know that other states passed laws concerning it so there is stuff on the books that other states can use
2041844 we certainly will try to make contact with the owner but if the car is parked at a shopping center and we dont know where the owner is we can enter the vehicle and remove the animal
2041845 well occasionally get a call from a neighbor wholl have another neighbor who has an animal tied outside and cant reach the shade if the animal is outside it needs to have an area of shade
2041846 we have done so even if its tied out in the yard with shade if the temperature is extreme
2041847 wed much rather bring it to the shelter where its air conditioned and have the owner come and pick it up
2041848 my advice is that if its hot out there dont bring your animals with you at all
2041849 deeply saddened by the lack of leadership shown by our state senator gilbert baker in addressing these controversies
2041850 sit on the sidelines with my finger testing the political winds
2041851 just like all the legislators in this area we will not interfere with the responsibility given to the uca board of trustees
2041852 my primary focus will be higher education funding and personnel issues from the president of a state higher education institution on down
2041853 that is where ill have the opportunity to demonstrate some leadership
2041854 i would feel thats my responsibility right now if youre paying me i would work now not after an election
2041855 one of the differences between sen baker and i is that as a senator i would not stand silent on an issue this critical to this district i think theres an obligation there to stand up and fact find and work on it to get us moving forward
2041856 legitimate questions there that the people of district 30 should have answers to
2041857 went through the same process as any other student applying for housing
2041858 any attempt to prove political favoritism is negligent and futile because it just is not true
2041859 appalling that the negative campaigning has already started but even more so that it involves my family
2041860 but i do think that you really need to be careful if someone wants to believe a conspiracy type thing it lends itself to that you just need to be careful
2041861 symbolically re affirm the mahatma gandhis message of non violence
2041862 saturday 16 august 2008 is an important date for the city of johannesburg and indeed for south africa
2041863 the events of august 16 1908 are regarded as an important milestone in the evolution of passive resistance as a form of protest against racial discrimination and apartheid
2041864 the indian consulate is in contact with a wide range of community civil society and other organisations to enlist their support for this march because mahatma gandhis message of non violence and passive resistance against injustice remains as relevant today as it was in 1908 the recent incidents of violence in johannesburg cape town and other areas make it especially poignant
2041865 gandhi used his influence and personal example to promote mutual respect unity in action and co operation between hindus and muslims
2041866 if the asiatic act is not repealed in terms of the settlement and if the governments decision to that effect is not communicated before a specific date the certificates collected will be burnt and we will humbly take the consequences
2041867 more than 1 200 certificates were thrown into a big cauldron doused with paraffin and set alight
2041868 from both the ecological standpoint as well as from the management perspective it is a sound and pragmatic decision to relocate tigers into sariska genetic studies have not yet been conducted on tiger populations in ranthambore so it would only be conjecture to say anything on genetic implications of translocation the managers and scientists are aware of the genetic consequences of an isolated population isolated population refers to the cautious presumption that these two tigers are indeed from the same blood line the road map for tiger conservation in sariska prepared by the wildlife institute of india stipulates more tiger re introductions in sariska and this may be done from other source populations to address genetic inbreeding issues
2041869 notification of the sariska tiger reserve as cth will render the entire protected areas inviolate and will make the space available for tiger sociology
2041870 relocation of tigers will restore the ecological equilibrium which was once prevalent in sariska the tiger niche was missing after the annihilation of tigers and leopard was occupying tiger niche now it has been restored
2041871 the male tiger was very recently sighted in the kalighatti water hole right near the main road meaning he has moved quite a bit from the interior area to which he was relocated
2041872 the prey base is abundant and there is plenty of water the primary factors on which we had projected the relocation and that is why it has been a success
2041873 anti poaching measures in sariska are being strengthened villages are being removed and traffic monitored there is much focus on the tiger reintroduction programme in sariska for the government to be lax on security and anyway poachers will now be focusing on other places with more tigers
2041874 ja ich habe es geh rt ich bin mir nicht sicher wie sich mich wieder auferstehen lassen wollen aber irgendwie wenn ich tats chlich in saw 5 dabei sein sollte muss es material sein was ich l ngst abgedreht habe aber ich habe absolut keine ahnung das ist horror du sch tzt dich mehr tot als lebendig
2041875 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way it almost would make me try too hard to get on the team so if i just focus on what gets me to play well it will me get on the team and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
2041876 it was a big gallery for a thursday tee time
2041877 anthony is a great guy obviously im good friends with camilo i think this is the first tournament round i played with anthony and its very impressive
2041878 and now i have 10 days to prove im innocent
2041879 ive been on that ryder cup bubble and she thought the last thing we needed was for her to come here on the bag and be a story and take away from all that she did it she said this was not a good time for it
2041880 then i saw a half dozen cars just like it
2041881 but the others they took the center console out of every car i dont know why they didnt take mine maybe i had it on the wrong channel
2041882 i thought it was a bit of a long shot
2041883 i have felt privileged to be part of this college community for more than 25 years and im enormously proud of what penn state behrend has become through the talents of so many individuals faculty staff alumni and community friends
2041884 i always say that penn state behrends greatest strength is its people and that is absolutely the case my decision comes with considerable sadness but also with a strong sense of confidence in the continued growth and success of the college
2041885 desperate to read the latest news from the games and send reports back home sports fans might fall at the first hurdle giving hackers the advantage
2041886 of course hackers will do their best to capitalise on this event the most effective way to avoid the pitfalls is to make your device an unattractive target weve published top ten tips to remind users to not throw caution to the wind after all the last thing any visitor wants is to find their bank account emptied while they enjoying the games abroad
2041887 i imagine that if the company wants to carry out an organic integration where estesa ceases to be an independent company then the regulatory authorities ought to investigate but while it is only a purchase of shares by the holding i fear that existing laws will not veto the move
2041888 the fact that central america is fragmented into small countries means we have problems of economies of scale a small market cannot support many big competitors it would be a different scenario if there was market integration at a central american level
2041889 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2041890 it should not be considered an end to the mahdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mahdi army if the us began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2041891 i do think 15 20 years ago it was much more just go sit on the beach
2041892 these days people are looking for more and more activities to do
2041893 ask yourself is there opportunity each day for ambulatory exercise
2041894 if you can walk and do interesting things thats great i love vacations where you go to a place that lends itself to a lot of walking florence for example you can walk the entire city
2041895 its no fun to be the odd duck in a bunch of people who are fitness enthusiasts and you cant keep up
2041896 think about what the community activities are if you cant do something dont do it but find something alternative to do
2041897 you are not going to get many psychological or social benefits from it dont have a lot of things to check off and dont over plan consider whether that third child might be better off with the grandparents
2041898 your trip should give you opportunities for healthy eating combined with unusual food
2041899 dont ignore the fact that youre in the south of france
2041900 i dont want to be known only as a t shirt and shorts kind of guy
2041901 like the coaches have been telling me and like ive been saying all along its about me being consistent its one step at a time one day at a time
2041902 jerome always plays great so im not surprised by what he did tonight
2041903 for him its just a matter of getting the opportunity
2041904 why would any domainer sell his valuable name at a large auction
2041905 the missing human touch 100 000 00 threat for a single character
2041906 iedereen is welkom om mee te doen we zijn vooral ge nteresseerd in samenwerking met designers die nog weinig of geen ervaring hebben met open source projecten we richten ons op brede participatie
2041907 the write off is the result of the application of accounting rules relating to the probability that we will recover our investment
2041908 it does not imply any judgment on our part on the viability of midwest
2041909 if there is a finding of guilt the military commission members may impose any appropriate sentence including death if the case is referred as a capital case
2041910 the day when yash chopra and karan johar dump him it will be finito for him
2041911 we are a farming community up here and if you go the other side of april youre getting into cropping season
2041912 any earlier its too hot and any later its getting too cold so it makes changing the date very difficult
2041913 there has been a lot of work put into building that weekend up and a lot of things put in place to assist the german fest
2041914 it really puts dimboola on the map and it is one of the biggest events in the shire i will be contacting the people concerned to have a talk to them
2041915 people get used to going to certain things on certain weekends and a lot of people come from interstate and keep it on their calendar
2041916 they will find something to go to somewhere else and the event will lose those people
2041917 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it

2041919 la ex chica rojo deber permanecer en argentina donde se realiza el programa mientras dure su participaci n
2041920 but we didnt know these people because they were exterminated before we were born
2041921 theres no good news in any of this but at least she was spared the horror of gas chambers or death camps
2041922 and i was concluding what id thought for a long time that there are no happy endings then i met yaron and i snapped out of it
2041923 if you have family it always goes on this is the lesson of all of this hold on to your family because its all you have because there will always be someone to continue it
2041924 he broke the mould the respectability the almost claustrophobic respectability that i thought my family was bound by
2041925 we are now seeing satellite navigation devices that are both sophisticated and affordable this has opened up the market to a much wider range of mainstream business and private users tomtom has been at the forefront of these developments and with this partnership our resellers can now offer this world leading brand to their customers
2041926 this is a key appointment for us and we are confident we have a distribution partnership in place to bring our award winning navigation products to a much wider audience in the irish market
2041927 a lot of the orchestra members grew up with this music just like we did
2041928 they were around at the time when you couldnt go into a supermarket or a pharmacy without hearing led zeppelin with
2041929 you were hearing them on the radio in the mid 70s they were huge some say i remember these dudes i didnt know the name of it or what the music actually looked like but there is it right in front of me many of them get a real big kick out of it
2041930 well get into four or five notes and the people will go nuts
2041931 theyll know exactly what the tune is we play it pretty much the way they know it
2041932 people arent looking for my interpretation of led zeppelins music theyre looking for the real stuff the stuff that many of these people have never seen live
2041933 you take that and wrap a huge orchestra around that sound and you get this wonderfully rich colorful music that they know

2041965 its the legacy of unconstructed infrastructure in our street system which is progressively being presented to council for resolution on construction
2041966 there is however a general misunderstanding and in many cases the knowledge of liabilities associated with properties in subdivisions involving these streets is lacking
2041967 it is a common comment when the council consults residents landowners ratepayers of private streets that they were not informed by either the selling agent or as part of the legal process of the acquisition of the property
2041968 this is a vexing issue and much depends on where these streets are when they are in the main part of town people assume private streets are council roads and wonder why we let them get into disrepair people just dont realise
2041969 are there legal issues that can eventuate on private roads i havent got the answers but i suspect some things could get curly

2041977 our plan and expectation is to have someone named and to be in place as close to that aug 15 date as possible so there will be no gap in leadership
2041978 for six months the chancellor has been trying to cannibalize criswell college to fund his building program at the church which will cost 170 to 240 million
2041979 accomplishments that have been achieved at the college and kcbi under dr johnsons leadership which are too numerous to mention
2041980 i firmly believe that due in no small part to dr johnsons contributions the greatest days at criswell college are yet to come

2042056 we view them as a very important country whos making an imprint and will make a bigger one as time goes by the u s china relationship in my viewpoint is about the most important bilateral relationship we have and for the president to insult china by not coming here would have been far worse

2042068 but we know where one of the main areas is and actually i have learned something in hungary which was just a small step in another direction to give us an idea if its the right thing i ran it in qualifying and its quite positive

2042087 what reason is given by the companies holding the leases for which they pay quite a bit of money for not drilling and making even more money off the oil they would get
2042088 if obama gets the nomination im going to vote for the candidate who left his first wife after she was disfigured in a car accident who pimped his current wife out to a crowd of bikers and who voted against equal wages for women that makes perfect sense
2042089 your favorite great blog post from other blog than yours
2042090 if we go back in the time tunnel 1400 years we will find that history repeats itself byzantium represents america in the west america will collapse as byzantium collapsed in the west the prophet muhammad could by means of unbroken ranks conquer byzantium the greatest power compared to todays america and this without a single martyr falling from among the muslims the prophet could by means of the unity of the muslim ranks and its awakening defeat the america of that time america is our no 1 enemy and we see it as our no 1 enemy as long as we learn from the lessons of the battle of tabouk which took place in october 630 ad make ready for them whatever you can of armed strength and of mounted pickets koran 8 60 we are prepared and ready but victory is from allah
2042091 the only solution is jihad the type of jihad put into practise by prophet muhammed and exemplified by shehu usman dan fodio and the late ayatollah khomeini of iran we muslims should unite and embrace this concept of jihad that will undoubtedly empower us to destroy oppression and oppressors and in its place establish islam
2042092 the muslims are required to raise the banner of jihad in order to make the word of allah supreme in this world to remove all forms of injustice and oppression and to defend the muslims if muslims do not take up the sword the evil tyrants of this earth will be able to continue oppressing the weak and the helpless
2042093 whoever of my slaves comes out to fight in my way seeking my pleasure i guarantee him that i will compensate his suffering with reward and booty during his lifetime and if he dies i would forgive him have mercy on him and let him enter paradise
2042094 the islamic affairs department of the saudi embassy in washington d c
2042095 i wanted to know the best of one who holds todays undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind i became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for islam in those days in the scheme of life it was the rigid simplicity the utter self effacement of the prophet the scrupulous regard for his pledges his intense devotion to this friends and followers his intrepidity his fearlessness his absolute trust in god and in his own mission these and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle
2042096 he was caesar and pope in one but he was pope without popes pretensions caesar without the legions of caesar without a standing army without a bodyguard without a palace without a fixed revenue if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by the right divine it was mohammed for he had all the power without its instruments and without its supports
2042097 barbarism should never have had an appeal for the left
2042098 in the language of the divine law this word jihad is used specifically for the war that is waged solely in the name of god against those who perpetrate oppression as enemies of islam this supreme sacrifice is the responsibility of all muslims
2042099 jihad is as much a primary duty as are daily prayers or fasting one who avoids it is a sinner his every claim to being a muslim is doubtful he is plainly a hypocrite who fails in the test of sincerity and all his acts of worship are a sham a worthless hollow show of deception
2042100 any place where islamic sharia is not enforced and where islam is not dominant becomes the home of hostility dar ul harb a muslim will remain prepared to fight against it whether it be his birthplace or a place where his relatives reside or where his property or any other material interests are located
2042101 the basis of the message islam is that one should accept the shariah without any question and reject all other laws in any shape or form this is islam
2042102 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over two and a half years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over five and a half years ago

2042110 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
2042111 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
2042112 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2042113 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2042114 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2042115 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2042116 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2042117 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2042118 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2042119 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2042120 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country

2042131 initially i felt bad about leaving work and would worry
2042132 but not now i dont want work to be my life
2042133 since i got married i got better about taking time off
2042134 at duke employees accrue more vacation time sick leave and holidays each year than many comparable employers
2042135 i watch my accrual rate and take a day off every now and then when i have accrued my maximum
2042136 studies have shown a link between the benefits of taking time off and better health and productivity
2042137 ironically work addicts usually think theyre accomplishing more by laboring away but they usually end up doing more harm than good all work and no play can lead to a range of mental physical and emotional problems that can lead to burnout and reduced productivity
2042138 if you find it more difficult than usual to feel good about whats happening in your life and at work its a sign that youre under stress
2042139 if you are more irritable and frustrated than usual take note because it could mean that your batteries are drained during those times it may feel very difficult to unwind and take time off but those are the times you most need a break even if its just one day

2042144 apparently they are trying to find the next josh cribbs an athletic quarterback who can make switch to returning kicks
2042145 i think julian could do it i think he could have a great shot at making an nfl team that way
2042146 he was the exact same height and weight as julian and he is about to play his 10th year in canada
2042147 marcus has had a very good pro career and he is very similar athletically to julian
2042148 in fact julian is probably a little quicker but they both are really tough kids
2042149 we have all of our offense and defense installed all of our schemes and now its time to see if our guys can do it with the bullets flying

2042159 glen was a loving and caring teenager who was looking forward to moving on to a new phase in his life
2042160 despite struggling with dyslexia he had recently achieved a city and guilds qualification in carpentry and certificates in both maths and english
2042161 he loved woodworking and was soon to have begun a course in plumbing hoping eventually to work in a job that would allow him to use his practical skills and talents
2042162 to gain work experience glen had been working voluntarily alongside a school caretaker who has given us glowing reports of glens work
2042163 glen loved fishing riding his bike and building model petrol cars we were all looking forward to his birthday next thursday when he would have been 16
2042164 if i had a tumor underneath my genitals when girls were passing by id be a very grumpy boy too
2042165 i serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views
2042166 hope we can change with change we can hope for beliefs we can change with
2042167 its different playing when you have a target on your back as opposed when no one really expects you to do anything
2042168 so we know what it takes to be good the young guys have bought into our system as well we really want to be good its as simple as that
2042169 ive talked to the older guys and were going to approach the season like any other just like when there were low expectations for us outside of the team
2042170 because weve been under billed we know more than anybody not to get too worked up about pre season rankings
2042171 we know what we have here we know weve got a lot of talented guys and an opportunity to do great things this year the character of this group and the character of guys individually doesnt allow for complacency
2042172 our philosophy the whole summer has been to just play hard and not think about those rankings
2042173 its good that we have four seniors who have been around for a long time and really know what it takes to be good
2042174 theres nothing wrong with a little healthy competition in the clubhouse
2042175 im probably the most fierce competitor that ever played the game of hockey
2042176 ive lived my life that way so when i come here tomorrow ill be mentally prepared
2042177 i dont want to be embarrassed so ill give it everything ive got
2042178 yeah i told him i was an oilers fan and he wasnt too happy about that
2042179 but he always talked about how he loved the battle of alberta playing in that so
2042180 to be mentioned in the same breath as bo jackson as a two sport professional athlete
2042181 the dlf ipl has left a remarkable impression on this years action on tv and confirms to the fact that the content formats need to undergo a sea change in order to create more opportunities for advertisers the short format league definitely had a universal appeal as it helped many brands reach their target consumers through various touch points
2042182 from 157 tv channels in 2004 now we are at 447 however even with this amplification the viewership percentage has remained the same for example in 2004 while at least a group of 8 channels enjoyed 41 per cent viewership that number remains the same in 2008 also the market share of eight channels taken together which was 2 per cent in 2004 has dropped to 1 per cent
2042183 this is a sign that confirms that there is an urgent requirement of format change and the tremendous success of dlf ipl only suggests that opportunity lies in short formats encapsulated with entertainment and international appeal
2042184 our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2042185 i call on all those engaged in hostilities to respect it

2042189 in 1988 we had 186 tons left but had originally been allocated 1 150 tons we had no political backing and the quota was simply stolen from us
2042190 when the emergency department gets full theres a limit to how quickly we can get to some of the more minor complaints
2042191 just fell down and broke my knee and went to the emergency room
2042192 but we have the staffing ratios we have enough staff to be able to see patients
2042193 we also have a growing number of patients who use the emergency room as their primary care
2042194 the biggest problems are in the biggest cities where they have basically overloaded the system
2042195 youre able to help that patient quicker youre not tied up with more complicated cases and so a lot of times its a much more efficient use of your time as well as the patients time
2042196 im certainly not finding it easy and despite having a bad day on wednesday we have been fairly consistent but it is a difficult class and we are just going to keep our heads down and see what we can do
2042197 we really want to win because it is good for business
2042198 it was a really good course today a lot of beating and running which gave us lots of opportunity to tack and gybe and overtake and we won by three boat lengths
2042199 colorado offers a wide variety of delicious and nutritious products that meet food pyramid guidelines
2042200 schools can turn to colorado producers to provide healthy ingredients at a reasonable price
2042201 what were saying is they cant do it in this location
2042202 this is no place to have an adult book store or an adult novelty store
2042203 that is materials that have sexual connotations associated with it sex devices toys lubricants the full spectrum of sexual novelty items that are sold
2042204 if any one whether it is an ex service man or any one part of the crowd is instigating the crowd to confront the army then after maximum restrain minimum force will be used
2042205 we do have intelligence reports that the terrorists may try to engineer some sorts of blasts and attacks thats our biggest worry
2042206 they terrorists can go to any extent to cause damage to the people
2042207 once the situation stabilises we will be back to our places
2042208 i think the gamesmanship frankly is immature it is not the type of decorum that i like to have on the floor
2042209 i think that it reflects that we are not doing business in the manner in which we should which is unfortunate this is why given that we are the majority party we did not allow it to occur
2042210 were at impasse were not even meeting anymore now its just about we need taxes period or were not doing a budget well then were not voting for a budget i think theres a way of meeting in the middle so maybe we have to go through this exercise so we can get there
2042211 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2042212 the invention of roswellite is a breakthrough that was made possible through a concentrated materials development program alongside a focused product and market development mission
2042213 what was once a niche segment is poised to grow and compete head to head with condenser and dynamic microphones for virtually any sound pickup application and now is growing at a very rapid rate of over 20 percent annually
2042214 most current ribbon microphones are sold through smaller sales channels and serve minor markets but all that has changed with the introduction of roswellite ribbons have gone from a nice to have to a must have product
2042215 we are experiencing a very rapid change where skilled artists select all of their instruments including the specific recording gear
2042216 a lot of people expect chinese women to be subdued and faithful that we should marry and take care of kids at an early age
2042217 i read this article in another publication it was about pole dancing in china
2042218 the department proposes to define abortion as any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation

2042221 weve evolved into a group of individuals but we as human beings are pack animals and we still relish getting together mark and i wanted to provide an alternate home
2042222 what ive learned in the process is that coffeehouses have replaced taverns and bars as community gathering places and thats a good thing
2042223 any physician who in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly performs a partial birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both
2042224 i think this is just too close to infanticide a child has been born and it has exited the uterus and what on earth is this procedure
2042225 not just too close to infanticide it is infanticide and one would be too many
2042226 i have consistently advocated for reproductive choice and will make preserving womens rights under roe v wade a priority as president
2042227 a womans ability to decide how many children to have and when without interference from the government is one of the most fundamental rights we possess it is not just
2042228 5x4 an installation for 20 performers and 20 household objects
2042229 thousands of small businesses will be robbed of what they are entitled to under the present laws if what the government is proposing is accepted by parliament
2042230 whatever social policy minister john dalli and his team of
2042231 what the government is proposing is to rob people of their wealth its as simple as that
2042232 what the government is proposing today is tantamount to requisition of private businesses by land owners without compensation
2042233 the government does not even have an idea of how many thousands of business owners are going to be effected it is unbelievable that the government is proposing a reform and does not present any statistics whatsoever to prove and substantiate the arguments presented
2042234 the government on the other hand must be prepared to come forward to pay the heavy economic price to compensate those who by act of parliament will be robbed
2042235 what the government is proposing is to rob people of their wealth
2042236 if its for cause they have to justify that in order to deny him his severance
2042237 other acts of gross misconduct in the performance of his duties and responsibilities
2042238 i do not consider my personal life a subject to be aired in public and used for political gamesmanship
2042239 i do not believe that there is evidence to support any accusation of my exerting undue influence to any matter involving the port authority
2042240 to lose this valuable internationally recognized leader in intermodal transportation at this time is serious especially when no cause has been communicated
2042241 its a dark day for toledo lucas county and northwest ohio
2042242 our next album death magnetic comes out in september and the day it comes out it will be available in the guitar hero 3 format which were obviously super psyched about

2042246 it is shocking that something like this has happened right on our doorsteps
2042247 you dont expect it and i hope the person who did this is caught quickly before he can strike again
2042248 there has not been an incident like this in the seven years ive been in the area
2042249 this vile attack has sent shockwaves through the community in moss bay
2042250 the area on mossbay road is well lit and ought to have been safe for anyone
2042251 it is imperative that the person that did this awful crime is caught as quickly as possible and until he is then we all have to stay vigilant
2042252 it will have been a traumatic experience for the young girl but the police are working hard to catch the man and i would urge anyone that knows anything to help them with their enquiry
2042253 somebody must know this man there is a good description of him out there and he needs to be caught
2042254 it is very unnerving knowing that something like that happened so close
2042255 the police have been great and let everyone know what the situation is hopefully they will catch him soon
2042256 these kind of attacks are very rare and we have the whole team involved to track down the man who did this
2042257 we are asking people to be aware of what has happened and take extra care if you are going out then go with a group for safety
2042258 we still have not spoken to the elderly man who was in the golden dragon takeaway which we would still like to as well as anyone who was in the area at the time
2042259 at 10 05am on sunday 15 april they were sailing along contentedly in the vicinity of george point
2042260 perhaps unfortunately they retrieved the white rope that had been trailing behind the boat and left it bundled on the foredeck
2042261 something caused james jim tunstead to take off his t shirt and glasses and leave them on the back seat
2042262 an obvious explanation is that he or his brother peter fell in while trying to retrieve his lure which was found wrapped around the port side rudder and the other went to his aid
2042263 even standing on the platform in the sugar scoop would be precarious while the boat was under way
2042264 falling in would be easy and getting back aboard nearly impossible
2042265 des started the motor but he knew that he had to drop the sails before he could go back for the two men
2042266 as the boat was running square before the wind any deviation in its heading or the winds direction that occurred as he left the helm and went to the winches and halyards was sure to result in an uncontrolled jibe
2042267 the swinging boom could easily have knocked him over board
2042268 this could well have happened before he even had time to unlash and launch the life ring
2042269 a blue coffee mug found adjacent to the life ring may support this reconstruction
2042270 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back to the boat as it was blown before a 15 knot wind and they struggled in lump seas
2042271 whether they were headed for gloucester passage or around gloucester island there can be no explanation for the boat deliberately turning out to sea away from any safe anchorage
2042272 i therefore conclude that the men were all in the ocean without life jackets soon after they passed george point
2042273 none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy the men would quickly have become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves
2042274 although i cant exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them drowning is a far more likely cause of death
2042275 i find each of the men died in the sea off george point in queensland on 15 april 2007
2042276 the three of them could not have been overcome without very considerable violence that would almost certainly have left evidence
2042277 it has been suggested that the fenders being hung over the gunwales indicates another vessel came along side but eye witnesses and the video vision testify to the fenders being out when they left abel point marina on 15 april
2042278 money and valuable electronic equipment were found on board ruling out robbery as a motive

2042280 she was loaded with talent that she was funny was more important than anything

2042285 singh is kinng is my first production it means the world to me because my fathers named is attached it is simple honest and positive which are the values propounded by my father
2042286 when i read the phrase singh is king on a truck back in jaipur i told my partner vipul shah that we had to make a film with this title that was the starting point we had no cast no story no director but everything fell in place thereafter
2042287 it is expected that all works will be completed in time for the re opening of schools with the exception of some 48 assisted schools the boards of these schools have not signed their respective agreements with the ministry
2042288 as these assisted schools are owned by and under the management of the boards the ministry has no basis currently for the undertaking of costly repairs of these private properties
2042289 the education facilities company limited efcl has indicated that while it is prepared to assign contractors to the schools in question it cannot guarantee on time completion
2042290 they have stopped the repairs and contractors are awaiting us to sign the contract we therefore have to respond accordingly based on the ultimatum we will find an appropriate response and hope all parties involved are satisfied
2042291 network deployment for our first four planned mobile wimax networks is ramping well
2042292 our portland ore market is now moving from network readiness testing to operational readiness testing
2042293 engage with the wider industry at a senior level as early as possible
2042294 we want to create a lasting legacy for the entire business tourism industry not just in london but throughout the uk

2042296 using a variety of criteria including activity on the playstation network
2042297 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2042298 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2042299 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2042300 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2042301 i guess the question is will we miss the money yeah the money will be missed but i cant think of a better reason to miss it
2042302 im highly disgusted and worried about this situation no minister is above the law and police should take action against minister silva and his band i will take action to prevent such situations taking place in future and to put a complete stop to it during my tenure as the minister of mass media and information
2042303 essentially by integrating a host of important plans you are plugging any holes that would have allowed significant events or crises to slip through the cracks and only be identified when it is too late
2042304 a company needs to initiate two important exercises the first is a vulnerability audit which will help to identify the areas of risk in its various departments and business disciplines
2042305 the second is a scenario planning exercise which must be held for all departments to help identify all relevant scenarios that must be prepared for

2042316 you would hope that they would have gotten them originally but with a little bit of work were going to sort through these so these individuals can get their photos back
2042317 not all handsets require them but an estimated 2 7 billion did at the end of last year
2042318 this is very special very important to all of us and behalf of the littleton high school class of 1965 it brings closure its just really meaningful for all of us who are still here in littleton and abroad

2042321 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2042322 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2042323 we had our low points last year but we really came on and played good basketball from mid december on
2042324 for us to go on and get five more postseason wins in the cbi you cant put a price tag on what that can do for a program
2042325 memphis played for the national title and could have won it maybe should have won it
2042326 we held them to 56 at our place it was their lowest point total of the year it was their first game as the no 1 team in the country yet im sitting in my office after the game saying hey they beat us by 15 theyre really good are we c usa ready for that gap to be shortened i think we are
2042327 with jerome jordans growth as a center and ben uzohs steadiness we should have a chance to be pretty good
2042328 then of course theres 7 7 ppg 3 7 rpg a small forward and one of two seniors this year we inserted him in the lineup and he really changed things for us because hes a true small forward and it freed up uzoh to play the 2 guard a more natural position for him it made us a little more athletic a little stronger
2042329 coaches have asked me what the experience in the cbi was like and for programs like runner up bradley and tulsa it was absolutely fantastic
2042330 look at the tournament you had 16 teams you had an acc team in
2042331 what will our carryover be thats yet to be determined our non conference schedule is very strong its made and built for the postseason for the ncaa at large bid weve got things in place now but weve got to perform earlier in the season than what we did last year
2042332 small particles of cartilage were cleaned out of the knee
2042333 while this is a minor setback for delvon we are glad that he will be able to return to action by the time practice starts in mid october i am confident that he has the work ethic and dedication needed for a successful rehab
2042334 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store
2042335 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were rich enough to afford this
2042336 if its to sic expensive for you check out my other apps they are all much cheaper
2042337 ive got 99 for the first person to write an im not stupid app that shows the same artwork
2042338 i have written to the home secretary because shrewsbury prison repeatedly tops the league for being the most overcrowded prison in the country
2042339 it places undue pressure on wardens in their roles and also the whole infrastructure of the prison
2042340 unless something is done about this urgently i will be calling for a debate on it in parliament
2042341 the government is simply not building enough prisons in the country
2042342 they have got to invest in more prisons because if they dont what is happening is we are seeing extra pressure put on the management of these prisons and prison officers having to deal with more people than they would normally but also the early release of prisoners
2042343 magistrates are less willing to give prison sentences knowing there is no space for prisoners
2042344 its awesome to have someone from my hometown going and doing something so big carter said
2042345 footballs done so much for me just for meeting good contacts ive saved all my money put it in the bank its given me a good head start on life

2042348 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2042349 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2042350 its an extremely powerful experience im just extremely proud to be canadian today
2042351 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2042352 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2042353 before we had a disk based medical imaging system images had to be printed out individually and then given to the radiologists to read radiologists were here till 8 or 9 at night just reading images
2042354 it used to take an hour just to generate an image now it takes just an hour to get a diagnosis
2042355 before we had a disk based medical imaging system images had to be printed out individually and then given to the radiologists to read radiologists were here till 8 or 9 at night just reading images
2042356 it used to take an hour just to generate an image now it takes just an hour to get a diagnosis
2042357 it has long been clear that the barriers proposal is a gross boondoggle but caltrans has been able to wave all that money in the faces of local elected officials who should have taken action months ago to stop the project unless such officials are now prepared to act decisively to stop the project on which over 500 000 has been spent in staff support costs they are likely to seen as undeserving stewards of the kind of funds that they are asking citizens to give them in november when voting on measure a

2042359 i built the same thing in db2 35 years ago with caching
2042360 so we are kind of back to the future here
2042361 the question is if i shift the load if i shift a lot of computing to the client then i reduce the number of roundtrips
2042362 that puts less pressure on the server if i had 14 servers i can reduce it to six servers so there are savings
2042363 i built the same thing in db2 35 years ago with caching
2042364 so we are kind of back to the future here
2042365 the question is if i shift the load if i shift a lot of computing to the client then i reduce the number of roundtrips
2042366 that puts less pressure on the server if i had 14 servers i can reduce it to six servers so there are savings
2042367 today we are seeing people on both sides of the spectrum either they put the apps that they dont really care about in the cloud or they put those really large important applications in the cloud
2042368 this announcement reflects a more strategic approach to put wales on the world map and enhance welsh culture and identity on the worldwide web
2042369 proper internet status for our nation will open up new marketing opportunities and help promote the wales brand
2042370 we fully support the one wales agreement objective to transform wales into a self confident prosperous healthy nation and society which is fair to all
2042371 the internet is the e engine for economic growth and wales needs top level access to deliver the innovation that we need
2042372 you will never be put on the spot never singled out and never embarrassed our dress code is simple if you are comfortable were comfortable
2042373 not everyone is comfortable with going to a traditional church
2042374 out here we are trying to reach anyone who want to hear the word of god
2042375 people dont have to dress up to come hear the gospel thats good
2042376 not only do we not have a physical wall there are no economical or denominational walls everyone is invited
2042377 it is the stained glass of gods creation and a cathedral ceiling that goes all the way to heaven
2042378 it doesnt matter if they are homeless or vacationers who come to the beach for the summer months we are here to offer a stress free place to worship
2042379 we usually start our baptisms for the year on easter and we try to do one every month until it gets cold depending on our schedule
2042380 we are real big on going outside the walls of the church and into the community
2042381 as long as theyve accepted jesus christ as their lord and savior
2042382 after all if the people cant come to us we can take the church to them just as jesus did
2042383 jesus was always out amongst the people i think we want to take his lead and follow him in that way
2042384 to be able to reach people in this nontraditional setting is just amazing
2042385 there has been a remarkable amount of uptake on this patch
2042386 we have to get better at fixing infrastructure we got lucky this time the next bug wont be as easy to deal with and this one hasnt been easy
2042387 we chose a design that would make all of the attacks harder not just the ones we know about
2042388 the industry did rally like weve never seen it rally before
2042389 but my senior year i wanted to really put a point on making big hits and sticking people in the dirt so that was my focus my senior year just to prove that i had some explosive power ive had some pretty big hits i still want to work on that some more
2042390 hes a good sized safety hes a physical guy right now and by the time he stays in the weight room hes going to be even more so hes got good speed hes an intelligent guy i think hes going to really be a good player before he gets through here
2042391 but im going to come in with the mentality of earning a spot so ill just go all out and if the coaches want to redshirt me thats fine that just gives me an extra year to get better and work hard
2042392 my coaches putting me in position to make plays and my teammates helping me out
2042393 it tells you one thing hes got good ball skills
2042394 it also tells you hes got pretty good awareness and football sense to be in the right place at the right time that many times
2042395 it is clear that companies coming to the market often have senior executive remuneration structures pitched well below the normal publicly listed rate
2042396 the disparities between companies coming to market and those already listed are significant and are likely to require adjustment after the ipo has taken place
2042397 by not thinking through how their senior management are retained and incentivised companies may negatively impact their ipo valuation
2042398 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2042399 we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home

2042405 it is not clear to me that google gadgets have been adopted in a widespread fashion
2042406 i love being on the bleeding edge of whats coming next
2042407 google gadgets are designed with an open architecture so that anyone can produce them
2042408 the net result is that unless you look at a gadgets code you cant be sure what it is doing
2042409 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
2042410 if we were to do only medical marijuana under an administration like the one we have now they would be contesting the medical judgments
2042411 law abiding citizens have been harassed and i mean really harassed for growing marijuana for medical purposes
2042412 taxpayer dollars should not be spent on spending terminally or seriously ill patients to jail it is inhumane and immoral
2042413 a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons especially with people of color
2042414 ending federal arrests is the key to marijuana policy reform
2042415 baby boomers have this perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction too many of us are in denial and it is time for an intervention

2042420 the exceptional sequence and scale of our drilling success in this area reflects the world class status of the pre salt santos basin to which bg group has substantial exposure
2042421 many successes have been achieved in individual caribbean countries in areas such as care and treatment and prevention of mother to child transmission of hiv however as a region there is no certainty that we will achieve universal access goals if we continue to do business as usual

2042423 the searches in europe are going on as i speak
2042424 they have already seized half a billion euro dollars as well as a large cache of firearms
2042425 all the intelligence we have gathered here in australia all the intelligence about the methodology will be shared with our european partners so we can shut this syndicate down
2042426 for a song that was originally deemed too raw and incomplete to be included on an album let alone be a lead single never would have made it has proved a career breakthrough for gospel mainstay
2042427 closed and protectionist european energy markets end up picking the pockets of consumers in this country
2042428 until this is done we are really shooting in the dark in trying to determine what is best
2042429 we have become a nation of fools and simpletons bereft even of that instinct to survival which even the lowest animals possess
2042430 there are also new spin down features which mean the storage systems power off when they are not being deployed essentially as new storage technologies become available such as 8gb fibre channel and 10 gb ip to allow the product to be connected into a cx4 storage system
2042431 one of the innovations within the cx4 is virtual provisioning which makes the machine more efficient and lowers the administration cost using this facility the customer purchases just the amount of storage they require and as such purchase more every quarter as they grow
2042432 outside of the capacity upgrades there are other recurring revenues such as maintenance and services to help keep the system running smoothly

2042437 mccain keeps talking to you the voters about me robbing you of his plans on americas future
2042438 its not that we are living obviously sinful lives its just that we seldom think about the will of god and for the most part are content to avoid obvious sins
2042439 families are broken many of our young people are growing up directionless
2042440 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
2042441 their care and custody does not change simply because they are in segregation
2042442 daarbij ben je verplicht te categoriseren en de data moet binnen dat model passen wat je dan hebt opgeslagen is niet de realiteit maar een weergave van een oude situatie naarmate de tijd voortschrijdt wordt het steeds minder waard
2042443 die kennis geeft geen harde oplossingen maar input voor gebeurtenissen
2042444 ze moeten meer gebruik maken van eigen kunde en inzicht en vertrouwen op eigen ervaring
2042445 als ze alleen op nummers afgaan waarom krijgen ze dan zoveel betaald iedere idioot kan een algoritme op een probleem loslaten een computer is dan veel goedkoper juist mensen zijn geschikt om buiten een model te treden
2042446 de bankiers dachten daar echt de wereld te beheren met hun getallen de wereld werkt zo niet
2042447 ze spelen een spel maar het probleem is dat mensen vals spelen en dan gelden de regels niet meer
2042448 dat is hetzelfde als in een auto rijden waarbij je continu in de achteruitkijkspiegel kijkt dat is prima zolang er geen bocht in de weg zit
2042449 juist dit heeft te maken met uitzonderingen en daar moet je slim mee omgaan een tool lost dat probleem niet op
2042450 als iemand zekerheid wil dan heb ik slecht nieuws want die krijg je niet

2042452 we expect that continental airlines will post a significant loss this year due to high fuel prices but its operating performance should continue to be better than those of most peer large u s airlines
2042453 we are excited about our expanded relationship with penn state taking our scholars to visit colleges while they are still in middle school is strategic
2042454 it has been statistically proven that the middle school years are when students make their decisions about their educational futures with help from penn state higher achievement scholars will begin to picture themselves as prospective college students
2042455 by the time the scholars graduate from higher achievement they have visited up to three college campuses most scholars will be the first in their families to attend college so helping them envision themselves as college students is important
2042456 and we hope that these bright young students will also come to think of penn state as their school of choice
2042457 it was great to see what a college campus is like and talk with real college students about their experiences
2042458 i want to make sure i have the chance to take advantage of all the opportunities offered by a college education

2042470 nothing in the text or video material of the exhibition incites hatred or violence
2042471 one would expect from a well known museum not to compromise on the historical facts and to tell the story from both sides only then can the visitor of the exhibition understand the narratives

2042481 there is a sign that there is a pro energy wing in the democrat party weve seen senator obama move a little closer toward maybe possibly somehow eventually if necessary being in favor of more energy
2042482 when the people of france were starving they went to the queen and said the people have no bread the queens answer was let them eat cake that is not the kind of response we expect from the leader of the peoples house in the united states of america
2042483 it is really exciting taking part in this historic time and the people coming in here are great
2042484 ive heard from folks from across the country asking to come and be escorted to the floor and ive heard from even more saying theyd like to come but they cant afford the gasoline to get here
2042485 i know i am not alone in having to cancel my vacation plans this year for members of congress to take a five week vacation while the citizens of this country cant is appalling
2042486 its so encouraging its invigorating to the point that ive missed four meals and didnt realize it until now ive been here since monday
2042487 ive been following this on the internet and i wanted my son to be able to sit in a seat on the floor of the house of representatives to be a part of history
2042488 my representative brad miller isnt here but i called his office and told them he should be
2042489 the ribs were about ready to poke through the skin
2042490 theres no question with what took place this year there will be extra steps taken to ensure the exhibit is healthy
2042491 we have returned and the message is pure and simple the sticking does not stop at the prime minister
2042492 we are the last generation with the opportunity to tackle climate change this is the naked truth
2042493 we can act before its too late but not by burning fossil fuels lets stick to this fact
2042494 climate change is not going anywhere and neither are we
2042495 while our obligation to ensure the safety of the british people and to protect the national interest is fixed and unwavering the nature of the threats and the risks we face has changed beyond recognition and confounds all the old assumptions about national defence and international security
2042496 it seems that teams are never out of it this year in the cfl
2042497 it was an exciting fourth quarter to say the least
2042498 just like us last week we came out of the locker room in the second half and were resilient so were they this evening
2042499 this is an excellent win for us we beat a very well coached football team hopefully we build on this
2042500 to get a victory on the road is huge but the biggest part is coming off two devastating losses where we had chances to win is great for us
2042501 we didnt finish off the way we wanted but we did run the clock out in the end
2042502 we are a lot better team than weve been playing
2042503 we just played better football all the way around we took less penalties and were more gap sound our players did a good job of knowing their plays and making sure of our assignments

2042518 the board was not given accurate information and was kept out of the loop on several things
2042519 i begged you berry to allow the federal government to come in and help us and you told me mrs
2042520 we are not going to be able to provide for our families or our children because of the boards lack of responsibility
2042521 we have been trying to put things in place to get accurate reports
2042522 we have been baffled many times trying to get accurate information
2042523 we are trying to do whatever we can to find the funds to keep the agency operating
2042524 if we cant do that someone else will come in
2042525 this board is not responsible for it but we are saddled with it
2042526 at what point does accountability kick in it appears you guys are not functional
2042527 especially when your living is derived from the yoke around the necks of tax payers
2042528 this board is not responsible for it but we are saddled with it
2042529 two thirds of the 150 objects on display arrived from abroad including such world famous museums as the louvre in paris the british museum in london the kunsthistorische museum in vienna and collections in florence rome and zagreb with the remaining 50 works on loan by hungarian institutions
2042530 bringing the stone of palermo to the exhibition is a great success almost as if the mona lisa had been brought to budapest
2042531 hills are a true test of character and how much you are willing to suffer to become your best in hawaii we also have the perfect hill climbing up a gorgeous beach that makes you want to do this workout
2042532 hills are great strength builders early in the year i encourage the athlete to build into the hill and be the strongest in the last third i particularly like giving a one minute tempo over the top of the hill to have the athlete be accustomed to bringing the leg speed back regaining form and rhythm after the legs are taxed from the climb an athlete with a champions mentality like bree embraces these workouts and looks forward to them
2042533 i do this workout early season to build leg strength and prior to races such as st croix and hawaii 70 3 that are hilly this can either be a general bike strength workout or a preparation workout for a specific race
2042534 je kunt wel geloven dat er eens een dag komt dat alle software gratis zal zijn of open source is maar dat is in ieder geval niet morgen en ook niet volgend jaar het is waarschijnlijk pas over tien jaar

2042539 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2042540 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2042541 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2042542 we are tackling crime and the perception of crime we have purchased and installed four cctv cameras for greenbank kells and hensingham
2042543 wardens and pcsos have also been using speed indication devices around south whitehaven
2042544 in the survey 75 per cent of people said that youths hanging about was a problem and they couldnt be seen in dark corners
2042545 street lighting has helped tackle this the bulbs have been changed from yellow to bright white now that figure is down to 55 per cent
2042546 its a relic of st andrew a very small small bone of the saint
2042547 we are worried that the individual or individuals who might have taken this do not know how holy and how serious this is
2042548 there is a sense of awe there is a sense of veneration that we prostrate ourselves for and we venerate these beautiful relics of the saints and we ask them for their intercessions to god
2042549 whoever took it i hope he has second thoughts and returns it
2042550 i would just ask that person or those people to bring them back no questions asked
2042551 examined canadian and west african coastal data imagined where those sediments pooled before the continental drift then extrapolated to guesstimate whats off our atlantic coast today
2042552 resource estimates are highly dependent on the current knowledge base which has not been updated in 20 to 40 years for areas under congressional moratorium
2042553 overall impacts of exploration and production are reduced because fewer wells are required to develop the same amount of reserves
2042554 i would renew my request with the modification that the trigger be 10 a gallon at the pump
2042555 big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production
2042556 we wanted to get the children from the local community involved
2042557 the store is fantastic it is more modern and very up to date
2042558 we provide a much valued service for the local community and i am confident our shoppers will be delighted with our improved store and wider selection of goods which will better meet all the communitys daily grocery needs
2042559 the money is to go towards a pool table as we need to replace the one we have it is brilliant and was quite unexpected and we really appreciate it especially now as more young people are using it
2042560 i just want everybody to walk under this and say theres something new here
2042561 i want it to look nice for visitors and prospective students as a reflection of the school
2042562 it just doesnt look good and its the first thing you see when you come to the school
2042563 the roof leaks so it doesnt even function as what its supposed to function as
2042564 i went to school here and i think its a good way to boost morale to see this better than it was in our day
2042565 i was in scouts and we would help out anyway we could and this is going to help the community when finished
2042566 i used to be a boy scout myself and i think its awesome that travis is taking on this responsibility of organizing this project for the community
2042567 i knew he would see it through to the end
2042568 we are thankful he chose our shelter for his project it needed the work
2042569 it is impossible really there are so many athletes asking for photos and so on
2042570 there have been problems with the torch but now is the time for the party
2042571 someone may have been walking their dog between 10 15pm and 10 45pm or leaving the bingo which was on at the zebras club that night
2042572 it is important we speak to anyone who was in the area and could have seen something which can help us trace this offender
2042573 this is an isolated incident unusual for the area but the fact is that a young girl has been subjected to a serious sexual assault and it is vitally important that anyone with information which could help us comes forward someone out there knows who this man is and if they do i am urging them to contact us
2042574 from the outset he treated me like i was a dangerous criminal
2042575 he made no attempt to be civil or courteous his manner was rude offensive and bullying
2042576 he told me three times he needed to caution me he said i could be arrested he told me he had the power to enter my premises i felt intimidated i tried to close the door and he wouldnt let me he started pushing his way in i was scared
2042577 all i did was take my newspapers to the recycling point at tesco
2042578 i take recycling very seriously i go two or three times a week as i dont like it building up between fortnightly collections

2042582 it was simple we never ever used my name we never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews we even had a fake title for the film we called it a spiritual journey it didnt work everywhere we went to salk lake city but no one would let us film there at all

2042587 my point was to try to find a venezuelan actor who looks as much like hugo chavez
2042588 this village is a very quiet place here i always feel rested and happy
2042589 today people criticize me for being a close friend of serdar i cannot understand the reason why i get beaten whether i am a friend or a foe of serdar
2042590 even on the greek side i was treated poorly because i am a friend of serdar although i have to admit that i very much like greek women
2042591 in a place where an army allows itself to kill unarmed demonstrators day after day we are not surprised that demonstrators protesting this acts are beaten up and arrested reshef is directly and morally responsible for the murders in niilin and we will continue to demand his accountability as well as continue to stand together with the people of niilin
2042592 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously
2042593 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4k byte sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
2042594 the cost per gigabyte of a 2 5 inch ssd is something like five times that of a hard disk drive
2042595 seriously it has been two hours can you provide us with another update for a company with your reputation im absolutely shocked at the apparent absence of customer service
2042596 i think this is a good resolution to the case
2042597 these people drink and gamble and blow it all we need to send a message to other people that this wont be tolerated
2042598 mr orphan has been standup from the beginning of the process knowing what he did was wrong
2042599 id much rather have prison time than a chance of getting several thousand dollars for restitution
2042600 well see a lot of that depends on the sentence hes a well qualified engineer who has an earning capacity but in prison you get 40 cents a day
2042601 we dont know where were going or what were doing but baby we are living the gimmick
2042602 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2042603 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
2042604 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
2042605 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
2042606 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
2042607 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
2042608 of all the talent they could have used they select the most talentless individual in the company
2042609 everyone is complaining about the announcement of mike adamle as the new raw g m but i think its a great idea
2042610 if they wanted to have a new take on the g m storyline they should have thrown several million bucks at brett favre
2042611 hopefully adamle has been acting out of place for the past few months because hes got some real heel talent up his sleeve
2042612 it is amazing how the show that has more wrestling does a better job of character development
2042613 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
2042614 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2042615 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
2042616 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
2042617 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
2042618 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
2042619 both sides also called for better understanding between the two countries
2042620 gmastasquirrel you should feel lucky people think you are so young
2042621 yeah eight years ago meeting my girlfriend at the olympic games was obviously also a highlight of my career
2042622 carrying the flag was a different highlight i dont know whats nicer but i guess it was meeting the girlfriend because we have been together for eight years whereas the flag it was only there for 10 minutes
2042623 life is a lemon and i want my money back

2042630 we will invest heavily in alternative fuels while remaing grounded in the reality that we will need to continue with oil maybe even drilling for our own in the immediate future
2042631 it would be great if we could get alternative fuels going but since that is probably not going to happen we are going to pay the idea lip service hope for the best and let the oil companies do their thing
2042632 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2042633 no worries ive got a rich wife to take care of me

2042640 if azeri diplomacy works properly the idea of engaging the eu into the negotiation process may come true
2042641 judging by the response we have received i expect the strikes to be accepted
2042642 negotiations are in a knot and we dont see any other way out other than to strike
2042643 we have to do what we can to reach an agreement and get them back
2042644 we see a number of companies using it for algorithm refinement for example if you have a search algorithm and you want to verify the relevancy of the results you are getting back thats a great application for mechanical turk
2042645 that helps developers see how well they are doing and fine tune their algorithm
2042646 you can ask a hundred workers or 50 workers or 25 workers to get a sense of how the search results play to a broader audience
2042647 a lot of websites allow users to add comments to blogs or actually create content
2042648 those websites have a set of guidelines rather than hire a team of editors to keep on top of all the entries you can ask the mechanical turk workers to check for appropriate language or if it is a coherent posting
2042649 we see a number of companies using it for algorithm refinement for example if you have a search algorithm and you want to verify the relevancy of the results you are getting back thats a great application for mechanical turk

2042652 weve got a lot of things in common with china
2042653 we view them as a very important country whos making an imprint and will make a bigger one as time goes by the u s china relationship in my viewpoint is about the most important bilateral relationship we have and for the president to insult china by not coming here would have been far worse

2042655 over the past thirty years i have had the great fortune to have been a founding member of dead kennedys
2042656 its been tough at times but particularly rewarding working and collaborating with men like biafra 6025 d h brandon jeff ted dave steve skip and especially ray however a recurring medical condition called angioedema has caused me to make the difficult decision to begin withdraw from the road and as a touring member of dead kennedys thus i have taken my leave as a performing member of the band for the foreseeable future that said i am not retiring from music
2042657 they just asked me what my name was asked for my social security number and how much i had caught

2042659 the number of school leavers entering full time courses in computing has halved in recent years this is in contrast to research that suggests that 163 000 new employees will be needed in the it profession by 2016

2042670 i would describe the capital club event as a major event on our calendar
2042671 it gives our program as well as the womens program and the administration a chance to interact with people that come to spartan stadium its an incredible venue you cant ask for a better place than the capital club this business is about getting to know people and creating relationships with them our fans get a chance to meet the players up front and in person talk with them and get excited about the season we have our first game two nights later so i cant think of a better segue into the season than the capital club kick off

2042679 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2042680 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2042681 and as for you jennifer asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2042682 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire everyone people who do care about my business
2042683 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2042684 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2042685 theyve extrapolated their own view that the f word is banned thats not the case
2042686 you would think in a nice pristine environment no one would be swearing but the fact of life is it does happen
2042687 it would be nice to have a lovely atmosphere but sometimes that breaks down lets not have more political correctness heaped on to stuff weve already got
2042688 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
2042689 there is absolutely no evidence this data has been misused and the measures we took were entirely precautionary
2042690 there will be a bucket passed round and those watching will pay whatever they think we are worth it is how they do things in the usa and should be good fun

2042694 you know thomas jefferson said we needed a revolution every once and awhile and i think the american people are speaking and i hope theyre going to get up in arms with their democratic and say
2042695 if they stick in a moratorium to prevent us getting oil and gas from our outer continental shelf to help the american people they put that in to a continuing resolution to keep the government going im sorry ive got to keep the american people going who cant afford these gas prices im voting against it no matter what bill they stick it in if its to honor my mother my mother would understand rest her soul i would vote against it we have got to take this stand
2042696 i think we really want to keep that ball in the court that it belongs in the democrats they have to proactively try to maintain these moratoriums on oil shale and on deep water drilling as their price to keep the government going i think theyre the ones that have to be answerable for that im assuming at this point that those things are over on september the 30th the american people should demand that they be over and the president should be moving forward as if the leasing process could begin on october 1
2042697 i did a tele townhall in may and all i heard about was energy prices and since may thats all its been i get no questions on immigration i get no questions on national defense it is all about the price of energy because i live in a part of the state where you gotta drive some distance to get anywhere and it has affected everyone up and down the line from the retiree to the young family to the small business everyone is affected

2042700 as much as we all care about the bridge it would never make the cut for spending hoosier tax dollars
2042701 the best way to do this in the true hoosier way is in barn raising fashion
2042702 anywhere near moscow folks were naturally heartbroken about the loss of the bridge but i was also struck at how much it affected people in distant parts of the state
2042703 i resolved to find some way to recover this part of our indiana heritage

2042707 london has led the way and provincial markets too have fared well there are concerns about trading growth going forward it will slow but there will still be positive growth everyone is facing rising costs for food and energy which is putting pressure on profitability
2042708 we want to see first hand what life is like in armenia and get a picture of what people in the west midlands could be doing to help
2042709 britain is right now in the process of withdrawing its funding from armenia because it classes it as a middle income nation
2042710 our recent strong momentum in the business and our positioning in the area of performance based advertising which has shown itself to be robust in the current climate has encouraged us to consider opportunities to accelerate our growth
2042711 blinkx has been developing advanced monetisation technologies which we are now ready to introduce aggressively into the market this transaction would enable us to accelerate the penetration of these more advanced technologies into the marketplace over the current planned organic approach
2042712 we believe that mivas shareholders would not be well served by any delay in negotiating or completing the merger process and that time and or another round of restructuring plans will not significantly increase mivas valuation
2042713 what a good article i want to read some more on this topic

2042717 with deep regret with counsel and with prayer we decided that i should tender my resignation from the division officer assignment
2042718 i will continue to serve as division president until another person is elected to this role and until that person reports for duty
2042719 i was always in hot water growing up and that was a bad thing back then now even though were in hot water thats always a good thing for us
2042720 what we do is we pump it out up on the hill and whats really nice about our campus is everything runs downhill and so we pump it it goes through our pipelines and each building gets the 192 degree water
2042721 and i guess oit owned some of this property here anyway and the president at the time winston purvine noticed that some places on the hill the snow melted faster up here and he said hmmm i wonder if theres geothermal up there he kinda noticed it was there and we moved the campus up here after we drilled the wells
2042722 i am kinda jealous you know its just one of those things when i get time
2042723 for the renewable energy program there is actually a geothermal course that they have to take when we get our power plant on campus too you can actually monitor it online
2042724 oregon and in particular this part of the state can be the saudi arabia of renewables all the sun and geothermal and wind were really well positioned to go gangbusters on renewables
2042725 with xfin in place at some of the uks busiest airports it is clear confirmation that xfins ip technology has the resilience to support effective communications in the most operationally demanding and mission critical of working environments
2042726 this latest deployment at belfast city airport will play a key role in ensuring effective highly robust site wide communications optimising operational efficiencies and productivity and position the airport for future growth in handling airport traffic
2042727 the texas economy remains strong however we continue to monitor the slower growth seen nationally
2042728 at some time i want to try rallying that interests me asphalt gravel and ice
2042729 id offer him a test itd be a great opportunity for us
2042730 we can do it because weve got the forest stages on our doorstep
2042731 im really pleased guys that are in formula one would like to be driving a world rally car one or two of them would like to be driving a world rally car rather than an f1 car if the same sort of rewards were there
2042732 sadly were not in that position but im sure that at some point the three drivers were talking about would end up behind the wheel of a rally car
2042733 i would welcome raikkonen because its good to have big names coming into rallying
2042734 its difficult to come from circuit racing to rallying because you have pacenotes and gravel driving is different to what he is used to
2042735 each year brings a new wave of landscape questions and concerns

2042741 omg google blocked my blog because they think im spam
2042742 the speculation that the position regarding the new commission composition is under discussion is just that speculation
2042743 what this does illustrate is the very difficult position that will apply when it comes to appointing the eu commission that takes office from 2009
2042744 the reality is that under the nice treaty under which we are operating at the moment the commission must be reduced to less than 27 when it takes office late next year
2042745 take that he said she said right out of the problem
2042746 we looked at officer daily activity reports for the last two or three years and only about 30 percent of our work day in and day out appears in front of our police car
2042747 officers are conscious that tourism plays an important part in the islands economy and crimes against any visitors are not tolerated
2042748 every year police on the island carry out operation columbus to detect offences against international students and to deal robustly with the people responsible
2042749 officers meet foreign student groups soon after their arrival to give them advice on crime prevention personal safety english law and how to gain help in emergencies
2042750 any assault on foreign students is highly regrettable and we are working hard to ensure that those who choose to engage in such conduct are brought swiftly to justice
2042751 students from the island and from other countries take their time at the college very much in their stride the island is a safe place and we do not see friction between groups at the college and we do watch for that very carefully
2042752 many of the student visits are by way of exchange arrangements with island children we would be rightly angry if our children were treated with anything other than courtesy and respect when they are away from home
2042753 just walking along you really cannot miss the cigarette butts
2042754 you see all the cigarette butts in there it just loses the beauty of why theyre there
2042755 i think a lot of people are pretty disappointed that they cant smoke anymore
2042756 when we were allowed to smoke in the taverns we had ashtrays and they were regularly cleaned out and taken care of
2042757 people didnt have to toss their butts out here on the street
2042758 maybe some people are a little angry and thats why theyre doing that
2042759 we invented the technology in the first place but sometimes we have a hard time actually pushing that technology further and deeper and deploying it other regions do it faster than we do and thats frustrating
2042760 whatever made those people think this way ill never understand
2042761 maybe if it happened to a member of their family
2042762 demonstrate that our strategy is working well even in a challenging environment for corporate spending
2042763 by selectively targeting the pdp cadres and publicly threatening the party leadership against stepping on the jammu soil the fanatics are setting the stage for the states division on regional lines as they have now unabashedly started striking at the roots of its composite culture
2042764 threats are openly being issued to our cadres in jammu and their houses are frequently attacked by hooligans
2042765 what can the hapless common people expect from a police force that is not even able to protect the legislators and former ministers from the wrath of the protesters in jammu
2042766 our cadres now it seems were deliberately made vulnerable under some larger design
2042767 wenn wir mit unserem gebot erfolgreich sein sollten w rden wir unser container frachtgesch ft apl mit hapag lloyd fusionieren daraus w rde die drittgr te container reederei der welt hervorgehen

2042774 wenn etwas crasht hat das relativ wenig damit zu tun dass in amerika letztes jahr das herumreichen von subprime krediten aufflog us hausbesitzer gerade panik schieben oder sich banker misstrauen vielleicht ist die finanzbranche f r den rest der welt auch gar nicht so wichtig wie sie sich selbst gern gibt
2042775 prophezeit haben die panikrufer dass die us konsumenten jetzt sparen weil sie ihre ausgaben nicht mehr aus steigendem hausverm gen und leichtem kredit finanzieren k nnen dass die banken kredite so einschr nken dass die investitionen einbrechen beides ist bisher ausgeblieben die sparquote lag neun monate nach ausbruch der finanzkrise unver ndert knapp ber null
2042776 ausgeblieben ist auch die pleitewelle von kreditkartenschuldnern die quote der ausf lle stagniere sagt harm bandholz us experte der unicredit gruppe
2042777 die investitionen in den wirtschaftsbau stiegen im fr hjahr mit j hrlich fast 15 prozent nimmt man den wohnungsbau aus liegen die investitionen bei gut neun prozent der us wirtschaftsleistung kaum niedriger als vor einem jahr und noch so hoch wie in der new economy
2042778 all das hei t nicht dass es in den usa keine krisen gibt etwa in der autobranche oder dass die konsumlust nicht schw chelt nur hat das wom glich mehr mit gestiegenen lpreisen zu tun weniger mit bibbernden bankiers
2042779 wenn es an der finanzkrise l ge m ssten die ausgaben ber viel mehr sektoren hinweg zugleich abst rzen nicht nur beim auto
2042780 i just hope that this is the beginning of many more
2042781 hopefully there wont be any more soliders but if it has for us to honor them this way
2042782 if five hundred men were to die to save 10 000 and if im one of the five hundred then so be it

2042786 brian giles has fewer homers than jeffy why in the world would we want him at his salary
2042787 at certain times this season i had my problems when it came to getting the maximum out of the car
2042788 but it is beneficial having the data and knowing that robert gets on very well with it it is also good seeing that in the races my performances have quite often been similar to roberts
2042789 were a very slow labor growth state and if you were to take out the increase of the hispanic population i would suspect you would see no growth or a small decline in the number of workers in connecticut
2042790 coming here for the same reason my ancestors came here because of the opportunities
2042791 on the other hand you want to know what the skill level is of the new population and you want to know the experience level of course the data doesnt tell you that
2042792 the first generation comes and struggles with language struggles with work generally doesnt end up with the highest paying jobs but the second generation which is what were also beginning to see here
2042793 our west hartford kids are going to colleges hoping to become engineers there is opportunity here
2042794 it is a challenge in the sense that many of the recent arrivals dont speak english as a first language
2042795 the kids are as bright as anyone else it takes a little bit more time to get accustomed to the language and academic testing
2042796 every district is changing here i represent the 3rd district at least 72 percent is latino
2042797 new arrivals take a little time to get engaged in the political process because the assimilation issues are a lot different
2042798 the central city is the port of entry for folks
2042799 as people are stable in a community and do well they go to the outlying towns in the region
2042800 i had screws and plates placed in my left leg so i will need some rehab to get the strength back but i have recovered very well from my other injuries and the specialist is very happy with my progress
2042801 obviously i had some pretty serious injuries but i have returned home now and am on the road to a full recovery
2042802 there is a long way to go yet and how well the rehab progresses will play a big role in whether or not i ride again this year but i want to try and make it back for the final round or maybe ride at motogp in october
2042803 one thing i wont do is ride unless i am 100 its a long shot but if i can get the strength back in my leg we will just wait and see what happens as at the moment i am happy recovering at home
2042804 i owe a great deal of thanks to the suzuki racesafe team they were just brilliant and have continued to lend advice and support as i recover i also need to thank all the management and staff at phil tainton racing and suzuki australia for supporting my wife and i during this difficult time
2042805 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimised for that obviously
2042806 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognising an ssd with a 4 kilobyte sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
2042807 the cost per gigabyte of a 2 5 inch ssd is something like five times that of a hard disk drive
2042808 all of the little girls in les miz wanted to play eponine
2042809 when we were younger we all said we were going to grow up to play eponine
2042810 lea michele playing the role of eponine was a no brainer
2042811 victor hugo described eponine as an angel with a dirty face well all we have to do is add the dirt
2042812 lea played young cosette on broadway during the time i spent working on the original broadway production when she was old enough to audition for the recent revival they apparently wanted her but she had put so much time into creating the role of wendla for
2042813 i interviewed lea for a webcast during her time in the tony winning hit
2042814 telling her that i honestly felt she had been robbed of a tony nomination for spring awakening and that i was sure her chances were not yet over to play eponine but at that time i never would have anticipated doing this production at the hollywood bowl nor playing a part in the prophecy of her doing the part shes so talented and so truthful incredibly gifted and a very deep and sensitive actor she has also grown from a beautiful child into a ravishing young lady its a trip having an adult acting conversation with someone i used to speak with as a child actor we have both been basking in the experience albeit short and have been laughing a lot also that voice is glorious just seamless lea works very hard and is very serious about the work i love having her here and so do the rest of the company who are all quite extraordinary
2042815 i was amazed by this cast richard has chosen everyone from 17 year old high school students that he saw in a production of
2042816 when i got here and i saw john lloyd young
2042817 i never would have thought of him as marius i think of him from his great success in
2042818 and the passion and the dedication that richard has for anything and everything he does is so incredible whatever he puts his mind to whatever he is working on he puts 100 percent into it his knowledge and his passion for les miz is so extraordinary he knows this show he feels this show he loves this show in my opinion i think this is going to be one of the best forms of les miz that anyone has ever seen really because he is such the heart of this production he knows how it beats and has put together such an incredible piece
2042819 i was talking to brian stokes on the second day of rehearsals i said do you have a list of roles that you want to play and hes like well ive been kind of lucky to play the majority of them he really has and now im here and i also have richard jay who hired me for the original les miz i have marybeth abel who is our assistant director she was my stage manager for the original les miz everyone who is working on costumes were the people who put me in my little cosette costume every night a woman named kathleen melcher was my dresser im literally connected to every single person in this production
2042820 i find eponine such a heartbreaking character to play because she loves marius so much
2042821 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
2042822 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2042823 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me

2042827 since launching the program in 1996 we have collected more than 42 million pounds of rechargeable batteries through call2recycle
2042828 expanding the scope of the program to include the ni zn battery chemistry is a logical response to advancements in the portable power industry and the proliferation of new battery chemistries in the marketplace
2042829 rbrc serves a valuable role joining the worlds major rechargeable battery manufacturers into a single body committed to act responsibly in support of proper resource utilization and environmental care
2042830 licensing with rbrc is an important step in helping consumers identify local recycling opportunities available to them and positioning nickel zinc to become a mainstream battery chemistry
2042831 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
2042832 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers

2042839 just because its written doesnt mean its the only one that we can use
2042840 i think the role of youth is that were going to have to not just come out but be out
2042841 i feel we need to be more direct in our actions and not settle for dropping trans inclusiveness off of a bill or not allowing anything to be pushed aside

2042850 im more saying that weve got to expect a lot more out of our group we have to week in week out be consistent week in week out we have to be able to make plays that can take the pressure off other positions i think they did some really good things in different areas last year at times we made plays but not at a consistent level and thats not pointing the finger at them thats pointing the finger more at me
2042851 we definitely know weve got to step it up and take it to the next level to the point where if we need to grind it out we can
2042852 sometimes last year we didnt do that but hes expressed that to us that we need to get better

2042865 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2042866 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2042867 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the democratic national convention and with the obama campaign
2042868 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2042869 we are taking the precautionary effort of returning any and all contributions that were solicited by mr abu nabaa
2042870 we had an issue with the idea there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of voting for or supporting john mccain

2042915 this morning at about 8 30 officers responded to a home in the 3700 block of elmore avenue for a report of a serious shooting
2042916 as it stands we believe that the gunman may be in one of the houses members of our swat team are here about to make entry and the investigation is ongoing as we speak
2042917 what weve done weve pretty much quarantined the area neighbors who are inside were making them stay inside and those who are maybe trying to come home were not really letting them get into the block for their safety
2042918 theyve got everything blocked up in the back i keep everything locked anyway cause you never know
2042919 its a dump truck and the dump body was way up in the air the top of the dump body hit in the catch bin he didnt just nick the bridge the body was up in the air at about 45 degrees

2042925 we are very excited to bring mens college basketball to puerto rico for the second year through this event
2042926 the combination of eight quality basketball teams and this wonderful setting truly make the oreilly auto parts puerto rico tip off a one of a kind sporting event
2042927 after winning two other parades i think it proves we have a lot of creative and talented people
2042928 we made a fabulous float it was just a work of art
2042929 it seemed like the community came 10 years in one year
2042930 the whole trip down there pulling a 40 foot float was really hard
2042931 then the day was beautiful and then it started pouring rain
2042932 i think its a large part of why we won because when they judged the floats they had judges throughout the crowd
2042933 even though it was pouring rain we acted like it was an 80 degree day and kept dancing so when our float passed the we were dancing and smiling the energy was amazing

2042944 the net result is that unless you look at a gadgets code you cant be sure what it is doing
2042945 our government held consultation meetings in hudson bay carrot river big river meadow lake prince albert and la ronge earlier this summer

2042960 christophers father is a trained professional philosopher i wonder how a man who passed comprehensive exams for a ph d feels deep down about his sons associating with such intellectual thuggery
2042961 its not so much that vox nova is left of center but that often that the blog hosts are much quicker to demean or chastise the conservatives on there who comment than the leftists
2042962 combine that with a few very abrasive left wing commenters who like to accuse everyone of being hypocrites being paid hacks hating the poor being racist
2042963 oh what a hypocrite to be against abortion when youre neglecting to help out these babies with welfare food stamps healthcare childcare etc after theyre born
2042964 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2042965 this reflects that deputies are working hard the citizens have heard our public safety campaigns and are motivated to assist in the safety and security of their neighborhoods and the teamwork between city and county officials and the sheriffs department has never been better
2042966 one particular crime larceny which includes vehicle burglary and theft from unlocked vehicles has been rising steadily for the last few years and it is fantastic to finally see a reduction in the number of reported crimes this is a crime of opportunity which we have really targeted our messages to the public the reduction in this area is attributable to the communitys partnership with law enforcement
2042967 youre not the first person to ask if im crazy
2042968 my response is that im not insane at all because there needs to be a place like this a place that was truly inside and outside of the box in a way that other people in this country arent going to do it
2042969 i looked at about 55 different spaces that i might lease or purchase
2042970 i was reluctant to see this space initially because it was a former studio platinum island and i was really looking at raw space but inside of five minutes i saw it was the skeleton of what i wanted to do i envisioned a boutique like very musician friendly studio downtown and i got a vibe off of this neighborhood i also had a very set idea of what the setup would be for equipment which is a really intense hybrid between the producers desk and the analog console
2042971 its the typical design that dave and i have done over the years we really tried to keep it true to the original footprint but improve upon it with more diffusion and absorption
2042972 i wanted the large speakers to be true and accurate and i wanted people to be able to listen on the near fields and know where the mixes were
2042973 with me its always more about feel of course the rooms have to sound great and these are two of the best control rooms ive ever been involved with im as proud of them as anything ive done in the past with my dad ed germano or on my own
2042974 the way it seamlessly interfaces with pro tools is what made me confident that this is the right decision
2042975 i played with the console in london and the fact that alicia keys has this console really opened my eyes shes definitely ahead of the curve here i realized that this was a lot more than an aws 900 people believe that the duality is simply a bigger version of the aws its not
2042976 a studio may have an 80 input console but if six or seven are not working why would you want to pay for that
2042977 reissues you know theyre going to work they wont buzz theyll be balanced from left to right so the idea was to pick the hardware pieces that i thought people would want to use as tools to shape their sound and i dont believe in charging people for plug ins when youre a mixing studio clients should have the ability to sit at the console and if they want to work inside the box fine if they want to merge the two fine if they want to listen on the big monitors great and if not they have lots of near fields to choose from
2042978 i think theyre extremely accurate and loud having four 12s as opposed to two 15s is more focused and i wanted these monitors to be able to come through whether we were making hip hop rock or jazz records
2042979 pharma 2020 virtual r amp d which path will you take
2042980 plummeting productivity of effective novel treatments in the lab means incremental improvements to r amp d are no longer enough
2042981 the resulting commercial deficit in pharma has enormous implications for the industry society and governments as a whole
2042982 equally as a society we must acknowledge that we cannot afford to suffocate the investments made by the industry into r amp d a concern that should be high on the socio political agenda
2042983 we have to face the issue that if pharma is no longer financially capable of this where will the next new medicines come from
2042984 many companies as well as the infrastructure of regulators and vendors that support the industry will have to make significant strategic organizational and behavioural changes
2042985 the choices they make will have a profound bearing on the business models and mix of skills they require as well as the skills of those who support them
2042986 connectivity technological intellectual and social will ultimately enable us to make sense of ourselves and the diseases from which we suffer
2042987 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2042988 effectively kill any application that attempts to use the gps including google maps
2042989 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2042990 it goes along with their plans for economic development for this area so i dont see why they wouldnt do something about it
2042991 i am afraid the resources for this task are also beyond the reach of the city
2042992 its kind of sad the boards are all breaking up and its looking like it needs some repairs
2042993 i just think itd be great if they could restore it

2043000 if the leg is close to 100 hell play in centre field
2043001 it has come to light that he had cocaine in his system one of the effects of that is you do become reckless you do not perceive matters perilously there are recorded incidents of people pulling in too sharply and of losing control of their vehicles whilst under the influence of that drug that must be a contributory factor in what happened
2043002 he has been noted for his good works and everything he has tried to do for the jewish community
2043003 sadly no part of british jewry is immune to addiction or the effects of recreational drug use
2043004 we have had an increase of calls to the crisis line from orthodox jewish individuals and we are laying the foundations for a north london base in response to this growing need we have trained volunteers who are dedicated to supporting members of the orthodox jewish community and who understand the cultural sensitivities prevention is better than cure it is very important to address this issue early on and not just with young people but also their parents grandparents and carers
2043005 just as in the wider community people in the orthodox community are exposed to and affected by drug usage and addiction for all sorts of reasons people may use or become addicted to alcohol or drugs or turn to gambling
2043006 in close knit communities the shame associated with this behaviour means that individuals and their families find it hard to come forward and get help jewish cares work with families affected by addictions has shown us that even members of the most orthodox families can benefit from the support and guidance we provide we hope this will highlight how important that support is to obtain
2043007 i chatted with the audience and kept reading all the signs people were holding up
2043008 i was only bad for like a minute but joe kept talking and talking for like five minutes

2043015 the consumer is taking the mindset that if i dont need it today then i am not going to buy it
2043016 department stores are going to have to have the right incentives to get customers into the store
2043017 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2043018 if you look at their performance history over the years then youd have to say they were the two best
2043019 im a bit reluctant to talk about people as being exceptionally good or anything else unless they have that complete package which involves your humility your respect for other people your respect for the sport and the way you actually go about your job
2043020 with both those two you know they are going to consistently perform
2043021 as a coach you could put them in the competition without any fear of i wonder what im going to get you knew that you were going to get the best of whatever they had
2043022 once again where does that come from good values the way he was brought up
2043023 in terms of efficiency of delivery shane kelly is probably one of the very best ever
2043024 shane has a very strong capability to just totally home in on what he has to do and exclude anything else
2043025 once again theyre learnt behaviours learnt when youre very young
2043026 you just look at the quality of those two people in particular i think thats what makes you a little bit proud of them its the way theyve gone about their sporting life and managed themselves

2043032 each embassy will also be provided with the abilities to process mrps which will ease the pressure

2043059 there are 40 food vendors concocting a wide range of palatable delights
2043060 its particularly encouraging and the staff have done really well
2043061 we recognise the staff are working hard especially with the additional activity we are putting through
2043062 we are extremely busy and we have high occupancy on the wards
2043063 consider kenneth cole one of the most engaging and engaged business leaders activists in the country
2043064 it is an honor and a privilege to have kenneth cole a figure on the front line of fashion trends aids awareness and social activism as our 2008 keynote speaker
2043065 made one of the single most remarkable philanthropic commitments in contemporary america a commitment that breaks down the barriers between the public interest and corporate sectors and between deeply held personal values of equity and justice and day to day business concerns
2043066 in doing so he proves that a social conscience and business acumen are not mutually exclusive and provides a role model for a new kind of corporate philanthropy
2043067 rounds out this years dinner as one of the most empowering educational and entertaining events in our history
2043068 this lineup promises to make the 2008 black tie dinner an experience like no other and therefore a draw to the entire north texas community this is very important because in economic times such as these the beneficiaries look to funding from black tie dinner more than ever
2043069 fine you dont need a nap go play i give up
2043070 map share in itself is a piece of software that sits on the tomtom users can accept to be part of this so if he or she is driving along and spots a data anomaly for example a petrol station has closed down they can then mark the coordinates of the station and hit the map share button
2043071 tomtom has 20 million users around the world in the eu alone it is covering the eu road network four times daily with over one billion gps track points a day on peoples location the direction theyre moving in and the speed of traffic which enables it to gain a greater understanding of traffic patterns
2043072 in the uk much of this mapping is public sector information local councils local authorities etc so if a road is going to be changed to say one way the local authorities will know in advance but the process of getting this information is very slow in some cases it doesnt exist
2043073 s o erros que a gente est corrigindo para nos policiar houve a presen a da imprensa aqui em s o paulo falhou quem falhou queiroz falhou porque o dr troncon me depositou e eu firmei compromisso com ele mas falhou ao meu controle
2043074 we appreciate the epa taking a careful approach to the waiver request and agree with their determination that it should be denied
2043075 we are deeply disappointed that epa has failed to recognize the very clear signs that the food to fuel policy is causing severe harm to the economy
2043076 it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply
2043077 gov perry recognized that a near tripling of feed prices would cost texas livestock and poultry farmers greatly put meat industry employees out of jobs and strain texans wallets
2043078 the same is true across america and unfortunately the decision by the epa today ensures that this will continue to be the case unless congress acts to restructure the ethanol mandates taxes and tariffs
2043079 the bush administration has missed a chance to immediately reduce food prices and more importantly to avoid the certainty of much higher food prices in 2009
2043080 congress and the next administration must immediately restructure our food to fuel policies if we want to avoid runaway food inflation for many years to come
2043081 we keep our prices very low to sell our products
2043082 im extremely blessed in being able to continue my time with ou gymnastics
2043083 i hope that i can give something back to a program that has given me so much over the last few years
2043084 jarvis is a talented guy who we recruited when he was in high school

2043090 only one other global organization uses the word family as frequently and obsequiously as the international olympic committee and thats the mafia
2043091 and as we know if an ioc member wanted anything in salt lake city they got it he asked for and received a prescription for one thousand dollars worth of viagra tablets
2043092 of nine actual or acting presidents the ioc had put three barons two counts two businessmen an overt fascist and a fascist sympathizer in its top position
2043093 unlike other prominent nazi sympathizers brundage never apologized for his hitler leanings as late as 1941 he was praising the reich at a madison square garden america first rally
2043094 samaranch joined the fascist movement in his teens he stayed loyal until it was disbanded on the eve of spains first democratic elections some forty years later samaranch never voluntarily tore up his party card he remained loyal until fascism died under him
2043095 the organizing committees in each bid and host city have taken olympic ideals and the games themselves as the golden path to corporate welfare heaven
2043096 i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2043097 he is a very direct player with lots of pace and is a natural and proven goalscorer
2043098 last year i felt very privileged and excited to be joining relentless suzuki it has been a fantastic experience and i have to be honest and say we have exceeded the results that i expected in my first year i will be looking to build on that again in 2009 i have formed a great relationship with the team and our sponsors ive also become very friendly with a lot of the crew philip and hector have been great to work for and philips input this season has really shown in my results a big shout must also go to relentless and suzuki who have shown great enthusiasm which really inspired me this season hopefully we can finish on a high with some top british superstock results and a solid ulster grand prix next week
2043099 we first hit 1b of lending within a year in december 2006 and last year the target was reached in october it is fantastic that we have secured so much new business already this year in the current economic climate
2043100 the credit crunch has not affected our lending abilities as we have such a strong portfolio this means that we are able to offer some very competitive deals on vehicle finance and contract hire and an increasing number of people have been taking advantage of this rather than going to banks for loans
2043101 nuventix has developed a unique technology that addresses the critical thermal management challenges of high brightness led systems as well as localized cooling for high performance processors dsps fpgas and asics
2043102 synjet technology is remarkable engineers now have a cooling system that unleashes the potential of energy efficient lighting without the noise power and failure modes associated with traditional motor driven fans we are very excited to bring this new technology to all of our customers
2043103 avnet lightspeed as the leading provider of high brightness led solutions to major and emerging companies designing lighting and illumination systems is an excellent partner for synjet led light coolers
2043104 avnet will contribute significantly to the adoption of this technology and growth of synjet products in the marketplace
2043105 as a program we have always placed an emphasis on academic achievement and these five women have taken that to heart
2043106 2008 proved to be a banner year both in the classroom and in competition but we are always striving to improve in both facets as we move forward
2043107 as it is believed to lay to rest the concept of obvious to try previously used successfully in challenging validity
2043108 can be understood to lie in the weight given to the data present in the patent specification in contrast to what was known at the priority date
2043109 in raising the bar for a test of obviousness many see this as bringing the uk assessment into line with the european patent office where to succeed in an obvious attack it is not sufficient to demonstrate a concept may be obvious to try but there must be a reasonable expectation of success
2043110 provided this draws the invention far enough away from the prior art there will be expectation that an inventive step may be acknowledged
2043111 even in my karting days i liked driving in the rain best my brother sven and i always preferred to go out on the track when it wasnt that full and that used to be the case when it was raining and in germany the rain falls all too often
2043112 you have to opt for a positive approach if you say damn its raining you are tense right from the start and if you make a minor mistake with this approach you tend to say i knew this would happen
2043113 weve got to save something for future wolfensteins we cant do him in yet
2043114 thats one of the cool things again about the wolfenstein universe we go back and we pull some of these things from real history and spin this what if story for some of it and some of it just kind of blows out
2043115 so like the kreisau circle originally is more of a group of aristocrats working behind the scenes in hopes to overthrow hitler here theyre gun toting resistance forces fighting on the streets but its kind of nice to take those elements have a framework of reality and build it out
2043116 gone are the days when we used to run after dollars holding onto them for rainy days
2043117 now we prefer the euro it gives us more riches
2043118 now we tell people not to take dollars when they go abroad its better to change it directly to the local currency
2043119 if people leave here with dollars and go abroad they lose when they exchange them its the same thing whether theyre heading to china europe or even argentina
2043120 whip out dollars at the french flea market now and theyll shoo you away
2043121 before it was like the second coming of christ but now they dont want it or if they do take dollars theyre going to take their pound of flesh
2043122 you have the u s still holding this trade deficit but now you have the possibility of a u s led recession and you have a weakening currency so its a very dark outlook for the dollar
2043123 to accumulate dollars as a precautionary element against rainy days but the accumulation of reserves has become so large in most emerging market countries that the balance is way beyond whats needed for precautionary reasons
2043124 i think the factors that are affecting the weakness of the dollar will be reversed but no time soon
2043125 people just dont want to be holding u s dollars and u s based equities
2043126 if you are an investor with a million dollars to invest you look for the highest yield youre looking at south africa australia new zealand
2043127 providing these special services is just one of the highlights of the work we do at jarmel kizel witczak
2043128 my extensive background in civil engineering has allowed us to provide leisure village with services formatted to meet regulatory requirements address ongoing maintenance and repair and to ensure the quality of facilities and lifestyle amenities that residence purchased are maintained
2043129 just for fun a way to write down the day
2043130 we stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who are grieving and hurt in knoxville tonight
2043131 we know that when they are hurt we are hurt as well what we will do together this evening is to approach honestly our own feelings and make ourselves stronger for our own futures our faith provides two most powerful resources to accomplish this love and hope
2043132 we know that the perpetrator of this violence was wounded in some deep way that influenced his actions
2043133 he failed to account for the courage of greg mckendry
2043134 some of us now carry more fear than we did before
2043135 at one moment proud of our position as a church that welcomes and affirms liberals and lgbt folks the next moment feeling targeted and vulnerable i think fish in a barrel comes to mind as a progressive queer uu professional i may be expressing my personal fear more than anything but we all want and need to feel safe especially in church and i feel less safe than before
2043136 while the feeling of fear and anxiety is very real and very natural lets take a moment to envision a different reality
2043137 one that is safe warm accepting one that is loving and free from threat one that accepts people for who they are and embraces their differences and lets remember that we can both individually and collectively create this reality
2043138 there was obviously a lot of talk going around but im very happy with this team
2043139 when i began with mclaren the target was to extend this contract and im very happy to stay here
2043140 i have no regrets with my previous team and i have nothing to say on that it has all passed
2043141 i learned a lot we had good times we had bad times but at the moment i am very happy with mclaren the atmosphere here is very good
2043142 now we can just focus on racing and getting good results we dont need to talk about contracts
2043143 by allowing the guest operating system to indicate its intent to the hypervisor each can cooperate to obtain better performance when running in a virtual machine this type of communication is referred to as paravirtualization
2043144 high performance computing hpc managed desktops web 2 0 technologies and software as a service saas in virtualized environments
2043145 they had erased the previous directories probably because they didnt have room to keep it
2043146 in the case of coreflood youve got people infected who didnt do anything wrong
2043147 if youre not an expert you probably shouldnt be online doing financial transactions
2043148 i am very worried about anybody using windows and banking online
2043149 it is likely they are looking for the larger accounts
2043150 you may not see any activity on an account for months
2043151 they just dont have the time to go through it all
2043152 the relationships are not as good as they need to be to have effective action taken
2043153 the people in law enforcement tell me that to get anything done they have to go through diplomatic channels
2043154 there has to be political pressure brought to bear it has to be a priority
2043155 we think there might be a better chance of getting these guys because of who they have infected
2043156 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
2043157 adolescents play pranks i dont think it was a threat against anybody
2043158 our opponents have said they will raise and spend 10 million to 15 million
2043159 the generous support of our donors means we will more than match them and have a full communications campaign for california voters
2043160 the reports of decline between 2003 2004 are totally outrageous
2043161 those are not our statistics and we totally disagree with them
2043162 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you i shared so much of my life i should have something to hold on to
2043163 in accordance with the constitution and the federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2043164 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2043165 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2043166 where are all the masses with regard to the alexandretta
2043167 they have forgotten all about occupied al ahwaz the alexandretta province and about sabta and malila who is against normalization the resistance and hamas you say examine this shameful paradox several months ago hamas would launch decorative missiles and would accuse the palestinian authority of mahmoud abbas of oppressing resistance fighters now for the past two or three months hamas has given normalization a cute nickname tahdiya which sounds slightly nicer than normalization and it began to arrest people who launched missiles what is this paradox
2043168 a people that participates in a campaign on the scale of the arab zionist conflict and whose land is occupied cannot open a second front in alexandretta or anywhere else this does not mean that it has forgotten its rights but that it would be crazy to open several fronts simultaneously all over the world we learned this lesson painfully in 1967 when our army fought both in the south and in the north we must not live in delusions
2043169 my colleague dr ali oqla orsan said regarding the question of why we have forgotten alexandretta that it is all a question of priorities to be honest i do not understand these priorities alexandretta was occupied in 1936 and we have forgotten about it and al ahwaz was occupied in 1925 and we have forgotten about it palestine was occupied in 1948 so what are the priorities do you want to liberate the first region to fall or the last if you want to start with the last region go ahead and issue just one statement about the uae islands occupied by iran this proves that there is a defect in the thinking of the anti normalization committees
2043170 ive been coming to the island since 1953 and we always come to the regatta we just love it theres a great atmosphere great events and its a wonderful day out
2043171 the committee has worked so hard to make this an absolutely marvellous day
2043172 the bathing beauty competition was a real highlight and the alice webb memorial cup competition was wonderful it was a very fitting tribute because it was lots of fun just like her
2043173 yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
2043174 i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
2043175 we owe it to our kids and families in america because those who are suffering the most are the lowest income americans
2043176 i believe we can do it and that will reduce when we eliminate our dependence on foreign oil we dont care what the saudis charge because well be in charge of our own
2043177 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
2043178 were all on the same journey you can choose to do it with joy
2043179 participants in the 25km dikwiel race will ride the route once cyclists in the 50km race will ride it twice and professionals in the 100km race will do four laps
2043180 alternatively one can enter on the day of the race
2043181 one of the aims of the vodacom tour de soweto cycle challenge is to promote cycling as a sport in the townships and to change the perception of cycling as an elitist activity
2043182 while the old route attempted to cover most of soweto and followed a part of the path taken in the 1976 march the new route has been planned for parts of soweto with wider roads and less traffic hence avoiding traffic congestion and allowing for a better flow for cyclists
2043183 wherever possible please use alternative routes and stay away from dobsonville roodepoort road and the soweto highway as well as the route out of soweto past new canada
2043184 this year we are expecting about 5 000 because a lot of people are aware of the race
2043185 a number of cyclists from all over gauteng have already entered
2043186 the tour de soweto will celebrate soweto and share it with the world in the same way we have shared our diversity and reconciliation
2043187 people will get to see something which they have never seen before for them we guarantee that it will be a lot of fun this is something unique to soweto people will be surprised
2043188 the great support of the residents and the fun township vibe also add to this unique experience
2043189 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year
2043190 there is no other instance where new vaccines must be made every year the approval of flu vaccines is a part of fdas mission to promote the health of americans throughout the year
2043191 you have to start with the basics and learn and then just apply action every single day anyone can build an online business if they have the right teaching
2043192 lobo wifi will continue improving services for faculty students and staff by making the system easier to use
2043193 we are committed to keep working with departments to enhance wireless services across campus
2043194 my dad was competitive but he also enjoyed the social aspect of the sport at clearpoint
2043195 thats why my brother and i decided to make it a mixed doubles tournament our objective was simply to honour our father clearpoint was a very important part of his and our lives we were a tennis family spending many of our summers there
2043196 it started off bad and it looks like it will only get worse
2043197 my dad was competitive but he also enjoyed the social aspect of the sport at clearpoint
2043198 thats why my brother and i decided to make it a mixed doubles tournament our objective was simply to honour our father clearpoint was a very important part of his and our lives we were a tennis family spending many of our summers there
2043199 to fight against poverty it is necessary to give power to the poor
2043200 to vote no is to vote for bush to vote yes is to vote for chavez
2043201 this defeat is a response to the degradation of the relations between the government and the most combative sectors of the bolivarian revolution
2043202 there are a number of tests going on and we havent had any results at this point
2043203 we just tested there so that might help a little bit since its only a two day event it still comes down to the race and helios always there at the end you have to make sure you have everything right
2043204 weve got four races to go and a 65 point lead but thats very catchable for helio especially for the next four races the people were competing against are all really good at those four races helio i think is the real threat hes been very quick the past few races theyve stepped up their game a lot
2043205 kentucky is a tough track to master because its very bumpy and very fast
2043206 there is hardly any banking so its always a challenge to make sure we get the right setup on the team penske car
2043207 historically this hasnt been one of my stronger tracks but its my goal to turn that around this year i have had a solid and consistent year and were right there in the championship standings well need a strong finish this weekend as well as a little luck to go our way in order to make up some ground in the points battle we have a lot of momentum heading into kentucky weve won the last four poles and ive finished on the podium the last three races i certainly think with the way team penske has been performing we have it in us to claim the title when all is said and done
2043208 the constraints on development and ownership in the area should ensure that prices remain resilient through the downturn and are well positioned for sharp growth when health returns to the market
2043209 the best properties are unlikely to lose value given the ongoing demand for prime accommodation
2043210 there is an abundance of rental stock in the area much of it owned by the two estates
2043211 they separatists are trying to attack avnevi the fighting is ongoing
2043212 guns from apcs mortars and machine guns are being used
2043213 confrontation is not in georgias interests and i hope and im sure that the continuation of confrontation is not in russias interests either
2043214 when these detachments arrive the georgian side plans to launch large scale military actions
2043215 cogliere loccasione per riflettere su tempi e modi di tante inchieste giornalistiche e giudiziarie di questi ultimi anni che hanno spesso determinato lesito di primarie battaglie combattute in campo finanziario e non solo a cominciare magari dalla scalata di unipol a bnl

2043220 in an incredible move on wednesday afternoon july 31 the house and senate both quickly re passed the bill again this time with special emergency act language to thwart the referendum process
2043221 weve never heard of that happening before if a bill is an emergency act then its labeled as such before its passed not the day after its passed something was pretty rotten
2043222 massresistance was in the state house on tuesday as the house was debating and voting on the bill
2043223 during the day the idea of a referendum petition came up right after the vote took place a boston globe reporter eric moskowitz was interviewing us we mentioned the idea to him but we told no one else
2043224 in moskowitz boston globe article the next morning wednesday the referendum possibility wasnt mentioned but then during the day on wednesday the house and senate leadership both re passed it they rammed the bill through with the new language to thwart a referendum petition why now
2043225 we called moskowitz boss frank phillips at the globes state house office phillips said he knew nothing about it but it was possible that moskowitz had talked to the gay lobby for a reaction but if so why not mention it in the article this morning we called up moskowitz and asked him he denied telling anyone anything but the whole thing is very strange
2043226 had moskowitz included our idea in his newspaper article it would have been transparent to everyone what the house and senate were doing and why they were doing it it was certainly a newsworthy idea but he was silent and even afterwards in their longer reports none of the media mentioned anything about what happened
2043227 we definitely underestimated some things including the treachery of our politicians and their obsession to push their social agenda without any interference from the citizens
2043228 this is so loaded its written in an open ended fashion that anybody can take just about any part of it and grow it into a huge monstrosity
2043229 is a wide open door for any judge to censor anything that condemns homosexuality including scripture
2043230 i do believe that the bible is banned under the plain language of this new statute
2043231 who would have believed that the colorado state legislature and its governor would have made it fully legal for men to enter and use womens restrooms and locker room facilities without notice or explanation
2043232 henceforth every woman and little girl will have to fear that a predator bisexual cross dresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence
2043233 this is your government in action it represents a payback to tim gill and two other billionaires who have essentially bought state legislators with enormous campaign contributions coloradans deserve better
2043234 pre edintele cio jacques rogges pe care l cunosc i din mediile elitei sportive dar i de la bere mi a zis octavian mi e ti amic dar vorbe te mi de rom nia atunci c nd mi ar i ceva concret l am chemat s vad complexul de la izvorani i a venit din prima

2043236 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2043237 a wrath of god type thing i thought we were all going to be electrocuted for coming to a night game at wrigley field
2043238 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2043239 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2043240 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2043241 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2043242 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2043243 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2043244 there is nothing which is best literally for the whole people
2043245 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2043246 stroke of the pen law of the land pretty neat
2043247 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2043248 actually you dont need to follow someone just because he is a celebrity ok
2043249 sign up an account and follow lah who the hell asks you to update yourself its free
2043250 welcome to the 21st my friend you can abandon your cave and see the modern world
2043251 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2043252 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2043253 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2043254 la ex chica rojo deber permanecer en argentina donde se realiza el programa mientras dure su participaci n

2043260 people have been pointing the finger at me and saying russell killed that little girl
2043261 ive been angry i almost lost my job over it
2043262 no one has apologised to me except two ladies who said they were sorry
2043263 they had no right to print his name i was looking on the internet reading it all and its publicised in new zealand it doesnt matter where we go now its going to follow us
2043264 we were supposed to get married while we were down there
2043265 hes the most fun loving guy you could ever get hes a hard worker and loves his nephews and nieces
2043266 hed help anybody out everyone around here used to love him
2043267 in russell john gesahs case the dna evidence was pivotal in charging him and as soon as we became aware that there may be doubts about that we then ensured that further testing was conducted
2043268 when we were satisfied that that testing raised real concerns about the reliability of that evidence which was thursday morning we withdrew the charges and went public on it
2043269 the iraqi oil fields are run by the iraqi government manned by iraqis with many foreign workers form all over the world how is this american exploitation of those fields also as iraq keeps all the revenue how does america benefit or even control their oil
2043270 and to think the u s government invaded iraq and afghanistan to raise oil prices is again ridiculous firstly afghanistan has no oil
2043271 also the cost of oil has nothing to do with the war in iraq
2043272 it would have been saddams regime doing the killing instead of terrorists
2043273 the people of iraq have an opportunity for freedom and prosperity when the conflict ends under saddam they only had fear and terror
2043274 i just returned to chicago from california a great state with beautiful beaches and vast vineyards
2043275 it hasnt been an easy venture but its come through
2043276 the technology has great potential we have got business people willing to invest
2043277 we have an obligation to the citizens to provide ems and im going to do that
2043278 for lifestar to staff an echo unit 12 hours a day 7 a m to 7 p m would cost approximately 96 000 due to our salary and benefit structure and need to rent a vehicle
2043279 you are able to do this at a much lesser cost by scheduling part time staff no benefits and you already have a vehicle and equipment
2043280 if you are able to maintain a volunteer staff thats the way to go
2043281 without them volunteers we dont have a system right now
2043282 indicate a growth figure perhaps a percentage point better than in june
2043283 the cost characteristics of the industry appear to make it difficult for firms to rapidly contract in the face of declining demand
2043284 lead to considerable excess capacity in the face of declining demand
2043285 although one airline may reduce capacity and leave the market capacity returns relatively quickly likewise while past mergers and acquisitions have at least in part sought to reduce capacity any resulting declines in industry capacity have been short lived as existing airlines have expanded or new airlines have expanded
2043286 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken no hyphens

2043290 by the way she looks great glowing and very happy
2043291 she and clay have been good friends for a long time
2043292 it is evidence that the banks dont think the economy is going to recover quickly
2043293 morgan stanley customers are typically coming out of their wealth management side so typically a high net worthy customer
2043294 this shows you they are under the same pressures as everybody else
2043295 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to hear people belittle diabetes because its maintainable everybody on our team is on full alert watching every move nick makes on that stage every single night of his life
2043296 it was a good test for us the last game before the league campaign kicks off for us and it was an important game
2043297 i think we did ok in the first half but we were frustrated a little by giving the ball away a little too cheaply and not taking our chances at half time we said that we need more from our front three which i think they did in the second half and we threatened more
2043298 we came away worthy winners i thought especially after the performance in the second half
2043299 vic has number of options that he can call upon he has signed two prominsing youngsters kim little and niamh fahey who will be pushing for places and of course julie fleeting is still to come back from injury
2043300 over the summer weve all had a much needed rest perhaps longer than we should have but the players have all been on various holidays to just get away from football completely for a while were back into a fitness regime with england and also our pre season with arsenal so it has been quite intense in the last month and everybody seems ready to put in a big effort
2043301 our aim with england is obviously to qualify for the euros we have two remaining games and they are crucial thats a must with the national team
2043302 with arsenal our goal is to retain the league title and win as many major cup competitions as we can
2043303 winning the uefa womens cup a year ago was a great achievement for the team obviously we got knocked out at the quarter final stage last season which was frustrating but i think the better team won on that occasion
2043304 were looking to push for the final its the best tournament and we want to be involved in that for as long as possible
2043305 i was very impressed with everton tonight and i thought they kept the ball very well they are obviously very well coached by mo marley going forward they lacked a little bit of composure in front of goal but that will come as the season gets underway
2043306 they always give us a good game and they are closing on us all the time and that can only be good for us we want that competition
2043307 i said to the players in the dressing room that even though i got the player of the match award i didnt feel i deserved it because i couldnt pass to a red shirt tonight the only thing i did right was the goal
2043308 im pleased that i was in the right place at the right time and my goal won us the shield
2043309 supplies of food shelter materials water and sanitations equipment and fuel for the transportation of civilians are running dangerously low
2043310 efforts by humanitarian agencies to replenish the stocks are hindered by the strict restrictions on the transport of goods into the region

2043313 we expect apple will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow
2043314 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer
2043315 plus amazons successful introduction of its digital download store will help the company improve its position in the future
2043316 telecom is now operationally separated a new leadership team has been appointed and the implementation of our transformation is in full flow
2043317 our fibre to the node fttn rollout is progressing well with 33 cabinets in place by 30 june and adsl2 technology is now available from cabinets or exchanges to 50 of all broadband end users throughout new zealand
2043318 they had erased the previous directories probably because they didnt have room to keep it
2043319 in the case of coreflood youve got people infected who didnt do anything wrong
2043320 if youre not an expert you probably shouldnt be online doing financial transactions
2043321 i am very worried about anybody using windows and banking online
2043322 it is likely they are looking for the larger accounts
2043323 you may not see any activity on an account for months
2043324 they just dont have the time to go through it all
2043325 the relationships are not as good as they need to be to have effective action taken
2043326 the people in law enforcement tell me that to get anything done they have to go through diplomatic channels
2043327 there has to be political pressure brought to bear it has to be a priority
2043328 we think there might be a better chance of getting these guys because of who they have infected
2043329 do they want that imprimatur of disapproval from a jury rather than a settlement where they can issue a statement that sayswe dont feel we did anything wrong
2043330 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
2043331 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
2043332 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
2043333 apple are proposing that mobile device owners could instead access their entire collection of itunes over wi fi or cellular networks
2043334 we have filed a police report and they are beginning an investigation
2043335 i dont know who did this it may not have been akron students it may have been someone else all together trying to create problems the kent state akron rivalry is a great rivalry that should be settled on the fields and on the courts not with vandalism
2043336 they are a pretty intense group to begin with but todays practice had a little more of an edge to it than usual
2043337 i really dont want this to elevate the desire in anyone associated with kent state to retaliate

2043345 nakshatra was launched in in 2000 with ashwarya rai as the brand ambassador both aishwarya and nakshatra grew to unparalleled heights in a span of eight years earlier this year the gitanjali group took over nakshatra we will now nurture nakshatra into an international luxury brand nakshatra symbolizes classic qualities of beauty radiance immortality and power at the time of deciding on the new brand ambassador we were looking at a celebrity with a mass local following and an international appeal we at gitanjali believe that katrina is the ideal brand ambassador to take the brand into the next level it is unethical to discuss the commercial deal and strongly believe that this will be a mutually fulfilling relationship for both of us
2043346 we were not able to find convergence in the area of the special safeguard mechanism
2043347 which are twice those subsidies that are being given and if developing countries want to guard themselves against a surge of subsidised products of course they need a special safeguard mechanism
2043348 when lamy reconvenes the group of seven negotiators at midday the indians and the chinese express reservations and the us rejects the proposal outright much to lamys understandable frustration
2043349 europe the brazilians and australia argue that the demarty solution offers a way out of the impasse
2043350 although demartys technical group continues to refine the formula at one point the us official simply does not show up when the group reconvenes after a break on her way to what can only be the final green room the us negotiator susan schwab goes via the press room to get her rebuttal in first
2043351 at 140 china could have used this mechanism in eight out of ten years to raise their tariffs at above bound rates in the case of poultry china could have used the mechanism six out of nine years to raise their tariffs above wto rates india could have used the mechanism in three out of six years to raise palm oil tariffs
2043352 the us complains that previous proposals set the trade flow trigger for safeguards too low that the measure would effectively mean a guaranteed new tariff on us exports of soy and cotton
2043353 give the us what they are asking for in certain bulk commodities
2043354 that will be a big factor on what were able to negotiate as far as the specifics on cotton
2043355 started this finger pointing i am surprised because they are now talking about cotton sugar rice of china
2043356 the us is not in a position to discuss with developing members on cotton tariff until they eliminate their cotton subsidies as requested by african cotton four
2043357 it is unfair to doubt our class at international level
2043358 we are a different team now we have only lost three of our last 28 matches and won a big tournament the nehru cup of course all credit to our coach bob houghton i believe he is the best thing to happen for indian football he changed the face of indian football we pray that hell extend his contract
2043359 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done

2043363 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time
2043364 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2043365 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2043366 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2043367 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2043368 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2043369 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2043370 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2043371 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2043372 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2043373 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2043374 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
2043375 the goals of the climate leaders program are very much in line with monadnocks core beliefs
2043376 monadnock has a long history of using clean renewable energy and of continuously improving our environmental footprint joining the climate leaders program is a natural extension of our commitment to the environment
2043377 throughout its history monadnock has taken its role as a steward of the environment seriously
2043378 it bothered me like it bothers a lot of your average citizens who find it difficult to understand how somebody is out on bond for a felony
2043379 sometimes they tell me you know why should i point the finger at someone when theyll be back out the next day and i got to worry about my family
2043380 there might be a few losses because its such a tough league

2043383 really the sky is the limit once the browser is under the control of an attacker and that point is exacerbated by the fact that people trust google be a trustworthy domain making the attacks even easier

2043392 tara really wanted to get a random roommate this summer and she liked the idea of kim kardashian amp toni braxton to appear on dancing with the stars
2043393 because the arab government wanted us to be more arabic
2043394 the rebels were too hard to find so the government decided to attack all of our villages kill all of our men rape our women and steal our animals
2043395 they did this by giving weapons and horses to the janjiweed many villages including mine were burnt to the ground our water has been poisoned hundreds of thousands of people have been killed three million have been made homeless my brother was killed and i saw many people murdered
2043396 i have to rely on the generosity of others i cant even afford english lessons all i want is a normal life safe from violence and oppression thats why i want to stay in this country
2043397 the jewish community has always been on our side they understand genocide racism and oppression im so grateful to the jewish community please continue to help us i am very scared of being sent back to sudan where my people are still being killed

2043405 somebody needed to throw out a well thought reasoned proposal to ratchet up the quality and urgency of the discussion
2043406 i think the region has suffered from an overzealous desire to reach consensus without providing any kind of clear vision
2043407 youre basically trying to reduce opposition to the idea of conserving water
2043408 you cant solve a problem until youve identified what it is
2043409 i violently disagree with this almost pathological preoccupation with education
2043410 and there is a regulatory component out there if we get to rationing and cutbacks
2043411 if were saying you need to cut back 10 percent we need to make the case as to why its necessary
2043412 the customer who conserves isnt being given the proper message that youre doing a good job
2043413 because it doesnt have much of an impact on what theyre charged the signals are so horribly upside down in the way we charge for water in this county
2043414 were the most water challenged region in california and yet we dont act as if we have a serious long term water crisis
2043415 conservation has to become part of the long term ethic of san diego and i dont see them doing that
2043416 we have no intention of selling him no desire we would like jimmy to stay
2043417 given the amount of money given to the club by chairman mr al fayed were reluctant to start re signing contracts that have got two years to go
2043418 the timing isnt right for the horse mike iavarone of co owner ieah stables and i discussed it and were not going to saratoga there is no reason to rush him back hes coming off a tough race
2043419 he has won four grade i races on the dirt and has probably already solidified himself as the 3 year old of the year if he wins the gr i breeders cup classic later this year it would give him a grade i on synthetic surfaces and if we find a turf event where he can win a grade i hell have won grade i races on three different surfaces

2043426 cancer is a global issue and we have had support from all over the world but this money is largely from the people of the north east and first and foremost it will benefit the people of the north east
2043427 thanks to their huge generosity and imaginative fundraising we reached our first target in just eight weeks and they are still pushing on so we can fund other cancer related projects in this region
2043428 im extremely proud to hand over the first cheque on behalf of the sir bobby robson foundation knowing that it will directly help experts like professor plummer battle this horrific disease

2043430 the fantastic generosity of the people of the north east and the dedication of sir bobby and his team means that we have secured the funding we needed in an unbelievably short time
2043431 the new trials unit will open in january 2009 allowing us to increase our ability to offer new cancer drug trials to the patients of the region
2043432 he might have been anti abortion but dont call him pro life
2043433 pro lifers are such hypocrites they care about fetuses keeping them from being killed that is but they neglect life that is no longer in the womb meaning they dont vote for the right set of government programs
2043434 with so much emphasis put on abortion by key people in the
2043435 some just because they are no longer in the the womb
2043436 some just because they are no longer in the the womb
2043437 finally emphasize the value of all life and not to neglect some just because they are no longer in the womb then ivins might have read and followed the gospel of life and then he might have actually been pro life
2043438 i think many people are upset at how i have shown why being anti abortion does not make one pro life and why one must never surrender the term pro life to those who are anti abortion and yet care less about other life causes i e torture
2043439 but the political movement makes anyone who is against abortion
2043440 so a nutjob kills some people with anthrax and we hear about how that means that there is too much emphasis on being against murdering people and not enough emphasis on social welfare programs
2043441 at the risk of dampening your insufferable self congratulation you really should listen to zippy
2043442 some one said on the newest post mornings minion put up to continue this ugly affair that vox nova was a breath of fresh air where does that person live beijing
2043443 not to neglect some just because they are no longer in the womb

2043450 rudolph dixon did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice in that he falsely represented to chief inspector reginald branch of the cayman brac police station that it was the policy of the police not to prosecute persons for illegal gambling
2043451 a quantity of cash and gambling registers which had been seized from them by the police
2043452 instructed inspector burmon scott of the george town police station to release rudolph evans from lawful custody
2043453 it is exorbitant he be asked for a bond and not allowed to travel
2043454 the deputy police commissioner has been accused of abusing his position that is very serious
2043455 someone was lawfully arrested and mr dixon has been accused of ordering his release for whatever reasons
2043456 the attorney generals office after reviewing the papers my office put forward decided to charge him

2043466 three years ago we began our business selling out of the back of a truck
2043467 frisco stables is centrally located and the clientele is perfect for our wares
2043468 it takes a lot of time and energy to find just the right products for our store but i really enjoy the search and i have fun displaying the items
2043469 one day we purchased items stored in a barn they were piled on a table and everything was covered with dust and droppings
2043470 after numerous days of transporting and cleaning we discovered the table to be of solid oak it made a wonderful addition to our inventory
2043471 we invite the community to browse our products or just visit for a spell
2043472 there is a known risk to commercially valuable and confidential information in some government and private sector systems from a range of well resourced and sophisticated attacks
2043473 it systems in government departments and various organisations including elements of the national infrastructure have been and continue to be attacked to obtain the sensitive information they hold some of the attacks are well planned and executed
2043474 increasingly combine traditional intelligence methods with new and sophisticated technical attacks for example by attempting to penetrate computer networks through the internet
2043475 avoiding reliance on a single technical solution for example not relying solely on mobile phones for critical communications maintaining up to date contact details to ensure non standard communication methods can be employed and focusing on identification and maintenance of critical users access to communications where possible

2043479 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2043480 in some ways it made things more difficult because the expectations became so high
2043481 then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and suddenly everyone was saying okay the next step will be the premier league title
2043482 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2043483 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner
2043484 people are talking now about us not having won the league for 18 years but it was 21 years since this club had last won the european cup
2043485 its clear that we are going in the right direction and progressing we have got good young players coming through who will be important while those with experience are settling down now
2043486 everybody can see that the team and squad is improving every year and that now we are much better but will that be enough to win the title
2043487 orascom is not related to or involved in operations or hotel developments in north korea
2043488 we are absolutely delighted that a judging panel for this prestigious award drawn from within our industry has chosen our stereo3d technology as one of the top ten innovations
2043489 stereoscopic 3d is arguably the biggest opportunity our industry has seen for a number of years and its sure to be centre stage at ibc for both broadcasters and the movie industry quantel has very much taken a lead in championing this step change
2043490 its rough to actually win a match like that it was nice to get through with a rather good form
2043491 actually i started hitting the ball better than before i got hurt
2043492 are short sleeves ok for a beijing opening in summer
2043493 its rare when you might get a chance to save a life
2043494 we just made it available to them it was nice to see a number of them respond
2043495 i appreciate those among the media who were willing to help us create an awareness
2043496 we get coverage for a lot of things but none that are quite as important as matters like this
2043497 its been good and its furthest ive ever gotten at the womens amateur
2043498 its a great course you can tell that the people here want you to be here its been a perfect course with perfect weather and i just couldnt have asked anything better
2043499 i may set myself on fire if you dont put headphones on
2043500 as always drivers should plan ahead allow extra time if necessary for their journey and follow the diversion signs
2043501 man kann sich gut verstellen dass das im fall einer dns attacke nicht besonders sicher ist ssl ist leider nicht das wundermittel das wir gerne h tten

2043503 we have information that fuel prices will fall in slovakia next week but we dont have any exact data yet
2043504 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2043505 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2043506 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2043507 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2043508 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2043509 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2043510 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2043511 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2043512 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
2043513 i have made no secret of my wish to add andy johnson to my squad at fulham
2043514 did i tell you how much i love new york
2043515 if we dont do this the deer will go extinct forever
2043516 somebody needs to bring them back they are a missing piece of the ecosystem
2043517 in the end it will complement the system and benefit the conservation of the whole wildlife area
2043518 some have been taken by leopards but that is a function of the ecosystem
2043519 public services continue to be transformed by technology improving delivery on the front line and making us more effcicient behind the scenes unfortunately some people seem to take pleasure in knocking public sector projects that involve technology which is why id enourage anyone with a success story to share it with the wider world by entering these awards i know the nominations will all be of the highest standard so im really looking forward to seeing all the winners in january
2043520 in my role i get to see how technology is being used in innovative ways to transform public services be it a small project that is helping a local community or a large scale project that is benefiting millions of people across the country we need to get better at sharing and learning from our successes the e government national awards give us an excellent opportunity to do this so i would encourage you to submit your nominations

2043527 sehr geehrter vorsitzender lieber werner faymann zu deiner wahl zum vorsitzenden der sozialdemokratischen partei sterreichs sp gratuliere ich dir auch im
2043528 things look positive the last place in the eight team champions league could well be filled up by middlesex to whom an invitation has also been extended
2043529 we are however awaiting confirmation of their participation in the inaugural edition
2043530 we would very much want a team from the england and wales cricket board to participate in the inaugural twenty20 champions league which will pit the best of the club teams in international cricket against each other hence we have invited ecbs twenty20 cup winning team 2008 middlesex
2043531 we cant believe they arent coming they are boycotting and marginalising the families
2043532 i would have thought they could have at least attended both events for the sake of balance
2043533 we decided that we would support the main event on the friday
2043534 that is the official one the one on the sunday is not official
2043535 theres a whole range of issues ive got problems with
2043536 the whole wording issue and some of the politicians that are going to be there i think theyve the council have made a real mess of it altogether
2043537 i have no objection with a family going its their choice but i certainly wont be part of it
2043538 im a very strong believer in a persons civil rights and the right to protect themselves
2043539 after his local civil rights had been returned to him
2043540 weve gotten a reply that they were getting paperwork together
2043541 we were caught off guard with the raid and there was a show of force you wouldnt believe
2043542 zonder dat ze het weet krijgt angelina jolie over hele wereld dagelijks mensen zo ver dat ze met een glimlach op de lippen een trojan op hun pc installeren
2043543 das ist v lliger unfug es gibt eine solche entscheidung nicht
2043544 the president had asked that pt merpati be audited to ascertain its current financial condition
2043545 this constitutes a new job for the new management to draw up a business plan which starts with a good new financial balance only after that can the rp300 billion be injected
2043546 we expect the warming to continue for the next decades and more significant changes to the environment than what we have seen before iceland will look very different with a changed biosphere by the mid 21st century and even more so by the end of this century
2043547 in the future we have to do things differently than we do today
2043548 this report shows that climate change has become apparent in iceland the warming for the past century has had as much effect here as in other parts of the world
2043549 rumors that barack obama was a secret muslim whose patriotism was questionable first appeared on blogs and in e mail messages
2043550 in march the rumors began to show up in the press though only minimally
2043551 barry baracks nickname was muslim he was registered as a muslim because his father was muslim
2043552 senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian
2043553 obama was born a muslim to a non practicing muslim father and for some years had a reasonably muslim upbringing under the auspices of his indonesian stepfather
2043554 interviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends
2043555 was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
2043556 the iraqis have got to pay more for their own autonomy and pay more for their own military and we have to reduce our commitment there and we have to do it quickly
2043557 mr jack well be back just as soon as your mouth is numb
2043558 your honor it is not my fault that i hit the fat bastard in the mouth the dentist gave me a drug that caused me to do so he is clearly trying to generate more business
2043559 then i saw what seemed to be a stabbing motion rather than a punching motion four or five times in very rapid succession
2043560 martin probably did not know when he began running away that he was running for his life pursued for such a distance by these defendants on cycles and mopeds
2043561 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2043562 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2043563 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2043564 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence
2043565 as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
2043566 its important for people to understand that this ambulatory form of treatment exists is successful and can be widely implemented in resource poor settings
2043567 dr tb is everywhere in the world its been looked for and its not going away without additional resources
2043568 but no one really knows how many have xdr tb
2043569 he pointed the weed whacker at my husband while it was going full speed and my husband put his hand up to stop it from hitting his face and at that time he injured his hand
2043570 i think that these people should feel safe in their homes and in their community and we intend to prosecute this case
2043571 it went from smaller things to attacks with the weed whacker attack and what would be next
2043572 he could come to somebody with a gun or knife and actually kill somebody
2043573 i was weed whacking in the back and the neighbor told me to get off his property
2043574 he kicked the weed eater and then he tried to grab it and hold it he then threw the weed eater in the alley and pushed me down and started screaming at me i was not personally on his property
2043575 we are encouraging customers to go the prepayment route as there are immediate benefits to the user
2043576 we are in the process of expanding the availability of prepaid tokens to banks petrol garages and spaza shops to meet consumer needs
2043577 we think we have a number of guys that we think have a chance
2043578 i dont think we have to rush anybody thats one of our strengths
2043579 the question with darren going into camp is playing time
2043580 in the stanley cup playoffs about five minutes a game is big time but we hope that he can become a real good third line center in the nhl and we have to decide in training camp what is best for his development is it to play 16 18 minutes a night in grand rapids of the ahl or to play five minutes in detroit were going to make that assessment after exhibition season
2043581 hes got very good hockey sense and hes a deceptive skater
2043582 we project him to be a top two line player but hes going to have to take time to develop
2043583 hell stay in sweden and should be in the swedish elite league full time this year which is a big step for him
2043584 thats like going to grand rapids well monitor progress from there and decide in a year if hes ready or if he still needs another year before coming over hes a very hard working real solid third line type of guy hes going to be a shutdown type of guy
2043585 the first year in the ahl you get your feet wet the second year you want to see some progress now the third year you have to start knocking on that door he had an outstanding training camp last year and went to grand rapids and had an up and down year
2043586 he came over from sweden this year and that was a big step for him
2043587 he did fairly well the big thing now is does he go forward this year stay the same or go backward he has high end skills and has to learn to take it to the net more
2043588 he just wasnt comfortable in north america yet were going to leave him in sweden and see if he can get his game going over there and then bring him over here hes got a chance with skills to be a second line guy but it will depend on development
2043589 he was a real good college player and we think he can be a real good second or third line nhl player
2043590 hes big and hes strong he likes to play physical our team is built with skill he doesnt have that skill but hes got the physical dimension and hes going to be that third line guy that can play left wing or center he finishes checks and hes also mentally strong hell chip the puck in
2043591 he was a second round pick and hes a forward prospect well leave in sweden he has a high ceiling
2043592 he was a second round pick and hes a forward prospect well leave in sweden
2043593 i thought he had a real tough first half of the year defensively
2043594 he was a big minus player but he realized that you have to be good in your own zone he has to get physically stronger hes a long shot to make our team out of camp next year because of our depth at defense but his strength is his ability to go back and get the puck and make the first pass which is so valuable in todays game
2043595 they think hes ready to play i think circumstances were one reason why he didnt play but if we had two guys injured they would throw him right in there they think hes ready to be an nhl player
2043596 hes still learning what to do in his own zone but we like his natural skills like skating ability ability to join the rush hockey sense and his hands
2043597 growing up he was a winger and he converted to defense so you know he can skate and handle the puck
2043598 hes still learning what to do in his own zone but we like his natural skills like skating ability ability to join the rush hockey sense and his hands hes got to get physically stronger his dad is a big man and were hoping he can grow into his body
2043599 he was a real good college goalie at maine he was then the top ahl rookie goalie but then he struggled he came back this year and wound up playing in the ahl all star game and was the ahl goalie of the month in december being a good pro is about being a good player for a long stretch of time its not about having a good weekend
2043600 we liked other players but given that dominik hasek is retiring and chris osgood is 35 years of age it was one area that we thought it was a good time to get depth
2043601 he plays deep in his net like a lot of those european guys do its time for him to come a little further out of his net part of being a good goalie is blocking areas and you cant rely on reflexes in the nhl because the players are so good
2043602 you can say user migration but the ground truth is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles
2043603 we still think the pc is a market worth supporting but were not making decisions around the pc its probably more of the junior partner in the cross platform strategy although obviously our day to day development is predominately on the pc
2043604 we certainly expect rage and the doom project on the pc
2043605 were contractually obligated to have rage on the pc and i would be stunned if we did not do doom 4 for the pc it would just be wrong even if it was a marginal business case we would still do it because its the right thing to do
2043606 this was a total suprise to all of us on percy road
2043607 the last i talked to him he was going to be making a phone call to the deq and see what he could do there
2043608 theres tons of this aggregate all over that wouldnt affect the livelihoods and homes of people
2043609 with our economy in its current state and to keep with the spirit of sustainability our goal is for greensummit to be both affordable and attainable to anyone and everyone who wants to learn more about these topics
2043610 it was just the beginning of a more sustainable future
2043611 the initial claims reading is not a good report for the market as it raises concerns about the labor market that in turn will continue to feed worries about a slowdown in consumer spending activity
2043612 demonstrates the successful design construction and operation of a fully integrated synthetic fuels facility utilizing the rentech process
2043613 we congratulate rentech in their achievement and applaud this step toward deployment of their alternative jet fuel technology using diverse and abundant sources with our economy and u s airlines both suffering greatly from high oil prices and reliance upon imports the air transport association and its member airlines are leading the way in promoting the development of cleaner lower cost jet fuels to meet the industrys operational needs and environmental goals
2043614 we are thrilled to win this award our industry as a whole generates an enormous amount of waste and it is up to all of us to take a proactive role in doing what we can to reduce our environmental impact
2043615 winning the toyota prius is a great bonus however the fact that we were able to demonstrate that edsys computers can build energy efficient pcs is a bigger success for us we believe that the prestige accompanied by winning this award and the recognition of our efforts in green technology is more important
2043616 a strong slate of movies released at the end of may and throughout june allowed us to achieve revenue and adjusted ebitda growth for the quarter despite a weak start to april and difficult comparisons in the month of may
2043617 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2043618 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2043619 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2043620 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
2043621 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
2043622 first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
2043623 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
2043624 everything about the fossil site from its geology to the fossils themselves tells us the climate shift was abrupt major and enduring its legacy continues to this day it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
2043625 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
2043626 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
2043627 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
2043628 in terms of what caused this change thats the sixty four thousand dollar question
2043629 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
2043630 seriously it has been two hours can you provide us with another update for a company with your reputation im absolutely shocked at the apparent absence of customer service
2043631 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
2043632 he was walking along the street he was grabbed from behind punched in the stomach and pulled backwards and was then able to run away
2043633 when the money keeps rolling out you dont keep books you can tell youve done well by the happy grateful looks
2043634 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty murray wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat
2043635 we dont know if theres a point weve lapped our friends whove gotten married and are already divorced
2043636 im not a solo artist i dont think i want my name attached to it
2043637 i basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to
2043638 i will be singing and im learning drums and playing electric guitar
2043639 i would like to try it and kind of switch it up
2043640 when i do the tour and stuff i would like to do maybe a section on the piano or on guitar or on drums
2043641 she shot the spot on tuesday at the paramount lot in hollywood the site of this years show with first time host british bad boy comedian and forgetting sarah marshall star russell brand it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2043642 i didnt know whether there was somebody on board who didnt want me there
2043643 that boat could have come from anywhere in the world
2043644 if the kaz ii was heading easterly it was my thinking that a vessel that wasnt being sailed by someone wouldnt be making any headway into the wind
2043645 my gut feeling is whatever had occurred had occurred on sunday the day they set sail
2043646 there was no physical evidence to suggest foul play or some kind of violent event in the confines of the cabin
2043647 one of the most unique bands straddling the line between progressive music and metal
2043648 colours he now owns owning a colour wow imagine owning the colour yellow like van gogh edge owns well im not exactly sure what colours they are indigo or violet or crimson
2043649 but you sense an emotional colour temperature that is unique to him its his palette were painting from
2043650 avoiding all the obvious blues scales that blind every other guitar player
2043651 two note played into a half dozen effects pedals than yes your right
2043652 its good for the environment it saves fuel and it is fresher
2043653 this is local chicken that was running around the yard two days ago
2043654 when i look back on what i was eating on my own before we had all of this i am able to see the value of what i am putting in my body now
2043655 the children at sucheta kriplani shiksha niketan school are ambassadors to disabled children across the world since the way they learn to overcome their disabilities and have such a positive and focused outlook on life can only be described as inspiring
2043656 i felt so strongly about the good work carried out last year and what a difference it made that i knew i would go back
2043657 the students from msuotc have risen to the challenge and this year we are aiming to improve the childrens living environment as well as their physical condition
2043658 what we have seen from him so far has not been too bad
2043659 until now he has been in a period of formula one apprenticeship and putting in a couple of good results
2043660 bourdais will continue with us in 2009 only if he really now begins to show us his potential
2043661 it needs to be clear that alguersuari is still at a very early stage of his development as a driver
2043662 while the coverage has improved in terms of sourcing women news media still uses women disproportionately as victims or the family of the victim rather than professionals
2043663 any visual media will almost always trump radio on poor coverage of women as they publish pictures of both scantily clad women and advertising that tends to use a womens body to sell their products this may have the effect of equating a woman with a product and casting women as sexual objects
2043664 it is a regrettable situation that has been plaguing not only sa media but african media in general for some time but women must stand up and fight for their total freedom and change the situation
2043665 sa has a combination of cultures traditions and religions which are conservative in their views on the role of women in society
2043666 media often just reflects the conservative opinions of media practitioners the implications are among others physical abuse and a sense of entitlement in sa men to the bodies of women these views also reduce the chance of violent men being held accountable via legal means
2043667 i think that journalists lack of time may lead to less critical engagement with a number of womens issues including the portrayal of women
2043668 also journalists tend to use sources that they have established relationships with rather than thinking to introduce more female sources into their stories
2043669 if journalists were more conscientised in terms of the sources they use they may try for greater gender parity and help challenge stereotypical views on the roles of women and men
2043670 w e anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in 2008 and beyond
2043671 if you want to blame anyone for the rainbows youd blame our art director brian morrisroe because brian is more the person who drove the art style into where it is but it didnt really come directly from him what he brought to the art team was concepts and ideas the idea of contrast the idea of using color more the idea of going for a more stylized look because what we were looking at before was more photo realistic really trying to get something that looks like a painting that was his goal but the actual result of that came from the art team and a lot of the environment guys and some of the texture artists theyve all kind of chipped in to try and get the feel of something that was very unique
2043672 it has nothing to do with the liberal party green shift plan
2043673 i believe in it i think its the right thing
2043674 a number of new opportunities have arisen in the private sector which make my continued candidacy untenable
2043675 we plan to offer council employees a reduction in their insurance premiums if they install it in their own cars
2043676 its not just the council who will benefit from its introduction we are partnering with local employers to encourage them to use the technology and adopt a culture of road safety for the benefit of our entire community
2043677 over 25 years weve grown and we certainly see the next 25 years and beyond as an opportunity to grow
2043678 weve got a staff of 45 or 46 people basically sitting on top of each other
2043679 i think the overall reason behind us expanding is for us to be able to serve more customers and clients on both sides on the glbt side as well as the medical side
2043680 were going to build something that people are proud of and its going to be a place where people are going to want to come
2043681 theres no doubt about it the black community has been sluggish in adapting to new technologies
2043682 it and engineers tend to be predominantly european and asian you dont see a lot of brothers and sisters in there
2043683 the african american community needs to come to the math and engineering sciences in general and we need to get them a lot earlier like in elementary school
2043684 i ask them do you know what a supersoaker is and then when they say yeah i tell them that it was invented by a black nasa scientist
2043685 only one of us could make it over the wall
2043686 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2043687 ya know im having trouble getting to my gym lately i wonder if there are body only fitness programs out there
2043688 i can give you all the tools all the science to get you in shape but all of that means nothing unless you do the work
2043689 i just feel like god wants us to connect want to get lunch

2043908 the most important thing to learn about a major championship is to stay patient
2043909 if you hit a bad shot youve got to take your medicine
2043910 theres not going to be many scores under par definitely not in the afternoon
2043911 it was a very good round and a very good start
2043912 its all about staying patient for the first three days and i need to get my head around that
2043913 new york tops the list for the fourth year in a row for two reasons
2043914 first origination fees are swollen by taxes that the state levies directly on lenders which are passed along to consumers second lawyers customarily conduct closings in new york many closings are attended by at least three attorneys for the buyer seller and lender in some other states especially in the west closings are conducted by title agents and escrow officers who charge less than lawyers

2043923 our ability to meet and to talk is in jeopardy at the moment
2043924 the bishops are about to converge in canterbury for the lambeth conference but we know only too painfully that a good number of bishops will not be present how can we work through the issues that trouble us the issues that divide us if we are not all present in the same room sitting around the same table worshipping together in the presence of our lord
2043925 i remain convinced that the great beating heart of the anglican communion the wonderful lay people of the church do not want their bishops to be talking about schism talking about division calling each other names applying labels such as apostates to people who dont necessarily think the same way about everything
2043926 the anglican church should be able to look to its bishops gathered at lambeth to work hard and diligently towards finding a way through so that the really important questions which are in front of us all can be addressed poverty access to water hiv aids the great questions of effective mission and ministry questions of interfaith understanding there are any number of tsunamis out there waiting to engulf the church while so much of its attention is being taken by questions of human sexuality
2043927 the two year old rustock comprises of at least 150 000 infected pcs distributing 30 billion spam messages daily
2043928 almost one third of all spam in circulation last week was malicious
2043929 rustock is largely responsible for that the rise in malicious spam and the rise of rustock are directly linked
2043930 the team did some great work over the whole weekend in terms of strategy and eliminating the problems we had in england and germany
2043931 weve worked hard to make the car competitive again and this is a good thing for the upcoming races
2043932 but weve got to resolve the remaining problems we have to be as competitive as at budapest but we need to improve our reliability
2043933 we cant repeat certain mistakes we dont have any more excuses
2043934 i have tried to forget the race in budapest but thats quite difficult
2043935 i dont want to forget it because in a certain way it was one of the best races i have ever had in formula one but it didnt end as the others with a win
2043936 it was a shame because i really think me and the team deserved the success we had a perfect race at a very important moment of the championship
2043937 unfortunately we couldnt bring home the 10 points we had in our hands which was really frustrating but these things sometimes happen in motor sports in the end it was not my day
2043938 when the engine failed i had a strange feeling it was like a nightmare and i wanted to wake up
2043939 it was an incredible disappointment this sport can be really cruel
2043940 but looking at the standings at least i can stay calm because not even lewis won however we cant throw away points like that
2043941 we repeat our message to all parties to immediately stop the violence

2043946 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either
2043947 in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40pc termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
2043948 content is moving away from the container eventually high definition content is going to move onto the internet more and more
2043949 victims of crime have a right to compensation this has been laid down in various international victims rights instruments adopted by the united nations and regional organisations such as the european union
2043950 victims could apply for compensation from the fund but they had to renounce their right to sue the airlines thats what a lot of victims did because they knew they would be heard and they would get their money much faster than if they went to the courts so the fund really had nothing to do with the people it was just economics
2043951 and the victims of the kenya bombing will always feel that they have been left behind
2043952 i dont believe kenya will ever take that path because of a lot of diplomatic and trade reasons
2043953 its aim is to provide a forum for victims of such attacks from all over the world as well as to encourage the united nations to set up an international fund for victims of terrorism who are not able to submit claims to their national government
2043954 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
2043955 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2043956 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
2043957 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
2043958 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
2043959 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
2043960 its still complications from the knee injury that forced her to pull out of wimbledon
2043961 theres concern about being able to play potentially 11 matches on it
2043962 its doing a bit better ive been resting it since i hurt it at wimbledon
2043963 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens

2043971 are you interested in finding the route to the loot
2043972 well why dont you just get on with winning some money and stop bothering us
2043973 so i have but i can assure you id completely forgotten it when i rang
2043974 durch den fr hzeitigen tod meines vaters musste ich hierher kommen um sein gesch ft aufrecht zu erhalten und das einkommen nicht nur f r mich sondern auch f r meine mutter zu sichern
2043975 um das gesch ft mit den partnern meines vaters weiter zu f hren
2043976 in einem jahr habe ich vierzehn kleine shops er ffnet
2043977 in deutschland k nnte ich mit 24 jahren sicherlich nicht mehrere eigene gesch fte haben
2043978 mit den arabern muss man schon sehr vorsichtig sein aber mir gef llt hier dass sich dinge wirklich schnell bewegen da wird etwas entschieden und kurz darauf umgesetzt
2043979 auch die lebensqualit t ist bei 45 grad im schatten nicht unbedingt so hoch wie in deutschland
2043980 aber ich bin ja schlie lich haupts chlich hier um mich gesch ftlich zu etablieren
2043981 ich denke mit 30 oder 35 jahren werde ich mir hier schon ein sehr sch nes verm gen erarbeitet haben und au erdem ist es bis jetzt auch noch steuerfrei
2043982 its so encouraging because those two ladies are real singers these are just reminders that my light is shining about a month ago i was asked to be a part of a tribute to mariah carey and not just to sing but to have a one on one session with her as we were backstage talking she just began to cry and said to me sis karen you changed my life while we were talking i could literally feel the yearning inside of her to know christ and we talked for a while yes they are mega stars but we have no clue what they have to go through on a personal level sometimes i know i am often criticized for it but god can trust me not to compromise and he has really been using me to bring them in so let the criticism keep coming leave my judas alone ok yall aint doin nothing but taking me to another level
2043983 i had been so weak both physically and vocally i just thought i couldnt do it anymore but my cousin james moss brought me the music to 2nd chance and i literally had to walk out of the room there was such a piercing in the music and a feeling of victory came over me at that time there were no words and i believe god had it set up that way so that the anointing on the music could inspire me to keep going
2043984 i would like to appeal to different audiences to reach the world and a lot of young people who dont go to church
2043985 although it peaked at number two on the gospel album sales chart 2nd chance was not the huge seller elektra anticipated gospel radio announcers took a cool hand to spinning the mechanical rhythms that didnt remind them of church at all
2043986 i will definitely admit that in the beginning of my solo career when i was on stage i was very hesitant but now ive more confidence in me since ive been doing ministry for a long time ive gotten to the place where i can hold my own now but i would say im still searching for them i miss them its like im out there alone theres nothing like the connection we have onstage when im by myself on stage its totally different its like something is missing and im definitely looking forward to going back to having that connection again
2043987 i remember at the holy convocation it was years ago
2043988 you know its funny the original person who brought me to word desmond pringle and most of the staff that were there then are no longer with the label i know it must be the lords doing though im just trusting in him as i learn the people around me it has been a blessing at word records there were several record companies who did want to sign me but i think a major factor for me was i wanted to reach a broader audience and even venture into the ccm market and i think word will do a good job at that
2043989 i know we will work together again but for now i felt it was time for a change i had become very inspired by the anointing on the lives of both aaron lindsey and israel houghton so although it seemed like a risk i decided it was now or never
2043990 thats my weapon song i use that one to fight with actually aaron lindsey did the music to the song and israel and i did the lyrics and when we turned it out as the finished product i said my god i think thats one that the praise and worship teams in churches will really pick up and run with
2043991 you know my mother was a preacher and my grandmother too so i believe what was instilled is just simply coming to fruition i didnt chose per se to go into the ministry but i knew it was time for me to minister the way god was calling for with authority plus i didnt want him to whip me i have been doing some preaching and speaking even in standing alongside my husband pastor j drew sheard but for the most part i leave that up to my sister dorinda i dont know how she does it singing one night preaching on another

2043994 as one of the most studied medical procedures lasik is well established and has an exceptional track record
2043995 todays modern lasik delivers superior safety and better visual results than ever before
2043996 so whenever we file cases against them they simply throw the licences away and issue another fake one
2043997 in order to ease the sufferings of the passengers a seminar to create awareness will be organised with the participation of the auto rickshaw and taxicab drivers
2043998 to meet the demands of the cng run auto rickshaw drivers the government increased the fare of all cng run vehicles but it is a matter of regret that they are still harassing passengers by charging extra fare ignoring meter readings and declining to go to the passengers chosen destinations so we have decided to launch a programme for creating awareness among all
2043999 we have to buy rice at higher price not only that but also the price of all essential commodities are now higher than before so there is no alternative but to charge extra fare from the passengers
2044000 its a testament to the strength of our growing economy that lafayettes personal income growth remains above the national average
2044001 with record low unemployment and wage growth citizens of lafayette are seeing greater prosperity which carries over into all areas of our economy
2044002 higher prices means that its now profitable to drill in areas that werent profitable in the past
2044003 companies have hired payrolls are expanding and that shows up as personal income
2044004 it has taken nearly a decade for these tests for gh abuse to be validated in large numbers world wide by independent experts
2044005 the results of large scale studies have only recently been published in peer reviewed journals
2044006 this will help ensure that unscrupulous users do not get any information prior to the games which could assist them in attempts to avoid gh doping detection
2044007 based on our earlier work on detecting epo using proteomics this project will enable us to develop a method for distinguishing between body produced gh and synthetic gh in blood
2044008 it will allow us to identify known and novel gh induced proteins that may be used to identify drug cheats in sports
2044009 it is the result of an open inclusive knowledge intensive process of problem solving
2044010 everything is way faster on offense were always trying to attack its just going so fast
2044011 the new guys have to get adjusted to the pace
2044012 the coaches are making them run the whole distances not half the distance like they were probably able to do in high school seeing the older guys go at full speed has helped them catch up to things
2044013 all the work has been done he has a physical set for saturday so he wont be out there at practice until monday
2044014 its the first time ive done a proper music concert in a couple of years i think in the time since then ive suffered what you might call a breakdown
2044015 sometimes and then sometimes someone will play something over something and ill like it and ill like their feel and so there were little sections where id ask frankie our guitar player to kind of come in and put his feel right there because i like the way you play that better
2044016 when we heard they say on the radio it was like i had never heard any of my songs on the radio before
2044017 our surgical teams have done a fabulous job cutting the lists so dramatically in just a couple of months
2044018 surgery connect should only be used as a stopgap measure
2044019 the health minister is constantly praising himself for employing more and more staff but he is heavily relying on private hospitals to treat sick queenslanders
2044020 without proper planning and an increase in future funding the reality is waiting lists will continue to grow
2044021 it would be ideal to have an indian team with a local driver to kindle the patriotism of fans but i would like to have the seat for my quality not just because of my nationality
2044022 both the seats in their sister team toro rosso are up for grabs
2044023 with the merger now completed were pleased with the integration of two strong teams and are focused on making progress in operating metrics
2044024 no doubt barack obama is a popular figure a celebrity who says the right thing but will he do the right thing
2044025 in some ways it has made things more difficult because the expectations became so high
2044026 then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title
2044027 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2044028 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner
2044029 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2044030 they werent my number one but ill vote for em
2044031 cmon democrats get together and we will win this thing for you
2044032 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2044033 its the morning after the elections and the usa has a new president he is the 47 year old junior senator from il even without the support of last elected democratic president bill clinton and a half hearted support clintons wife sen hillary r clinton from new york sen obama defeated his republican rival sen john mccain of arizona with all that sen obama had to put up with from the republicans and some democrats he won the elections with broad support from every demographic group to put it simply god is really with this young man may god bless the working of his hands and save our country
2044034 if huckabee gets the nomination ill vote for him but if mccain wins ill vote for hillary
2044035 country above party if hillary replaces obama as the democratic nominee i would vote for her if not im voting for senator john mccain in november nobama in november
2044036 flip flop issue how is it that it is not considered a more dynamic type of thinking that ideas and plans can change in the face of changing circumstance that is simply strategic thinking or perhaps plain old common sense
2044037 hillary seriously doubts that obama can beat mccain come november and she is thinking of keeping her name in nomination and demand a vote at the partys denver convention hillary wants to remind voters and the media that she was the alternative to obama a important point that could be brought home on election day
2044038 if they feel she has not been accorded proper deference
2044039 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
2044040 is that all there is is that all there is if thats all there is my friends then lets keep dancing lets break out the booze and have a ball if thats all there is
2044041 the mpc will almost certainly keep interest rates on hold on thursday
2044042 but the economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession the mpc cannot ignore the dangerous effects of rising insolvencies falling house prices and worsening pressures on the banking system
2044043 with uk inflation expected to increase above 4 5 per cent in the next few months the mpc may not be able to cut rates immediately
2044044 but as soon as inflation peaks later in the autumn the mpc must start cutting interest rates without delay
2044045 a positive housing market is essential for the overall economy
2044046 there remain strong economic factors in the country like high employment but confidence is a huge issue and only a significant move will restore that confidence and convince lenders and public alike the bank of england needs to reduce interest rates and take action fast encouraging buyers back into the housing market
2044047 we expect that very weak economic activity to increasingly contain and then dilute underlying inflationary pressures
2044048 we expect wage growth to remain muted as companies are under enormous pressure to contain their soaring costs particularly as they face slowing demand
2044049 furthermore the rise in unemployment is picking up and this is likely to increasingly undermine workers bargaining power particularly as companies may well threaten to offset higher wages by cutting their workforces
2044050 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
2044051 we are not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
2044052 while the rest of us pay 4 a gallon gas

2044057 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2044058 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2044059 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8million euros
2044060 i want to leave rennes i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me i am very ambitious
2044061 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2044062 good example of a rating system that provides a measurement of environmental achievement
2044063 he is a brilliant young lad brilliant kid and it will be brilliant to work with him this year
2044064 i will be there for him if he wants anything and i will be close to him but i am sure he will be in and out of the team this year and that shows a lot of confidence for a 16 year old to come and do what he has done to come through the ranks is difficult at one of the best teams in the world
2044065 i am sure he will be brilliant in the carling cup team and the premier league if he plays
2044066 its sort of like trying to balance your checkbook in the dark and the bank wont tell you how much money you have
2044067 at this time of year they are usually calling daily asking when are the bills going out
2044068 the transformer got knocked off of its foundation so it is going to have be changed out burger king will be out of power until crews get out here
2044069 we could find a hundred men in southern california who would be both able and eager to put in a thousand dollars apiece each year for a period of ten years
2044070 the normal thing you say now is from those humble beginnings we became what we are today but i believe its the opposite for the associates
2044071 i am humbled by our beginnings this is such an auspicious founding of the caltech associates and such an incredible thing that they were formed in the early stages of caltech and have performed such an important role in bringing caltech from a small little known institute into the world famous top university and research institution it is today
2044072 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2044073 since then ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
2044074 im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing
2044075 rest of the new york times s columnists are preposterous
2044076 at a recent dinner party the mention of hillary clintons name prompted him to use a four letter obscenity to describe her
2044077 if you dress oddly and youre really good at what you do youre seen as eccentric but if youre not so good youre seen as a schmuck
2044078 sarbanes oxley theyve got moxie but for businesses their act is toxic its not rocket science were killing profits with compliance
2044079 the idea that somehow or other the business community is full of all these greedy characters you should see the greed in teachers unions you should see the greed in any political organization
2044080 los angeles times was a hyperpartisan parochial broadsheet until otis chandler became its publisher in 1960 and began the work of transforming it into the paper of both record and insight that its been for the past half century i n zell what los angeles has is a visiting visigoth whose civic influence is about as positive as that of the crips the bloods and the mexican mafia

2044085 this announcement shows the momentum and wide deployment of linux applications on oracle
2044086 this technology has the potential to become a key tool for police in the fight against gun crime
2044087 the use of nanotechnology means we have at our disposal a much more reliable way of linking the gun cartridge and user which has not been available before the increased chances of being caught could therefore also deter criminals from using guns in the first place

2044089 i wont rely on the appointment by other people i want party members to decide on my political future
2044090 i am in the process of forming this team some invited by me some joining on their own
2044091 not all my team mates will run for important posts in the party
2044092 not necessarily we work in a team no one is the big boss number two etc
2044093 no one has said that chua jui meng goes against or with me neither have i this is purely speculation until now i still have no idea about his intention and i dont think he understands mine
2044094 i am now only an ordinary party member without any cabinet post so i will look at this thing in a practical manner however the 308 political tsunami saw the defeat of many cabinet post holders to previously unknown rivals i do not know whether a similar tsunami is in the making within mca
2044095 some say that there are no opposing factions within the party but when they attend some functions they have sizeable followers nevertheless the team a and team b today are no longer that distinct as those teams in 2000 we have team b members in todays team a and vice versa
2044096 first not to admit at all second apply for a court order to ban all media reports
2044097 no one told me to quit all the posts that was my own decision
2044098 ong ka ting has said it is not necessary for party president to hold a cabinet post he admitted that a party president with a cabinet post may sometimes be restricted in what he wants to say the most important thing is that we must know how to establish good relationships with other political parties i can still see the prime minister and deputy prime minister now
2044099 i am used to that only those who have gone through tough times will survive in the end
2044100 i dare to admit my mistakes and do not want anyone to threaten me with the vcd and become a burden to me some say umno leaders would threaten me with this vcd but i believe my political rivals will more so
2044101 that was my personal life at least i was not corrupt or abusing my power
2044102 i admit everything because i dont want it to be exploited by other people perhaps i wont win in the election but i wont let them get away with it
2044103 a successful person may not be impeccable but he wont repeat his past mistakes
2044104 be it a white cat or a black cat one that catches the rat is a good cat
2044105 i am not targeting at anyone however he is the mca leader and is therefore responsible for all major issues of the party including a poor show in the general election
2044106 to be fair to him ka ting has indeed done all his best to help solve the problems of the chinese community during his tenure as the party president
2044107 i have been active in mca johor for well over two decades
2044108 i am not a person trying to solicit support with my cabinet post
2044109 two days ago i went to see some divisional leaders and they said they had received the instruction from the party leadership not to see me funny why do these party delegates have to ask whether chua soi lek would be visiting their divisions
2044110 i am a johorean i was born here and will die here too
2044111 weve been in fund raising mode all the time myers said
2044112 the decision was just made that were going to do the east side
2044113 you still have to design and get all your architectural work he said
2044114 theyre working on it but theyre not complete by any means
2044115 we need to finish that east side off myers said
2044116 its just you have this great big building on the west side
2044117 the west side had a real impact on our annual giving by requiring a minimum donation as well
2044118 the snaplogic server is an execution environment for components the components could indicate read a soa endpoint or read a database but the components could also be things like filter this data set or concatenate these two strings or sort based on a keyword so there are access components and then there are transformational or logical components
2044119 when they do that they create a rest resource and that resource has a uri that is used to access it creating a data service
2044120 when i create that resource it actually lives at a uri the uri is actually the location of the server that im running snaplogic on and i can give it a path name if i configure that and save that to the snaplogic server that is an exposed restful data service i can point my browser right to that uri that i specified for that resource and bring the data right into my browser
2044121 so for example if you have a database reader and you give it a uri i can point my browser to that uri and i can get that data
2044122 i can execute a query and get the results in my browser
2044123 we can expose the data as a restful http endpoint and anything that can issue an http get can access that which would trigger the execution of that logic to deliver the data to the requestor

2044147 were looking at those videos and doing what we can to enhance them unfortunately some of these videos arent as high quality as they should be and the people try to mask their identity

2044149 why is he on the street if they think its that important
2044150 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2044151 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2044152 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person
2044153 usamriid is not like being in a shack in the wilderness its interacting with people in a pretty secure place
2044154 if i even suspected that he was anywhere close to being mental i would not have done the paperwork at all the state of maryland approved him
2044155 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
2044156 if we dont have a good handle on this at usamriid its probably true we dont have a good handle on it across the board
2044157 at that point the investigation still had a long way to go
2044158 i think what youre asking sir answers the question itself
2044159 he had been this way for a number of years going back for quite a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid
2044160 i would welcome him because its good to have big names coming into rallying

2044168 tomorrow is caylees birthday i wanted to speak with casey and see how shes doing
2044169 all this boils down to is she did not report her missing for 31 days if she had she wouldnt be facing that charge right now
2044170 there are phone call records from that day which are extremely interesting
2044171 the private phone call where casey claims to have spoken with caylee there was no incoming phone call at that time
2044172 casey gave the family information on how to get in touch with several people
2044173 i have on multiple occasions been told by many people that those people exist
2044174 frankly i wouldnt still be here if i didnt think she was cooperating with me and thats the point of all this
2044175 you often hear about persons having to choose between medical pharmaceutical products verses that of other basic needs so this kinda boils down to that so water being a necessity of life as we know to put the interest of the stock holder before that of the consumer is just totally unfair

2044179 the thing is people in toledo dont know about martzs commercials because most off our clients were people like the miami herald general motors pontiac anco wiper blades major accounts all over the country so they ran in all kinds of markets but they were rarely heard in toledo

2044185 not only do i have fond memories of doing commercials for martz i also had the chance to work with him in radio in the early 1990s at wcwa when the station played adult standards and big band music
2044186 he had his own ad agency but he was also a radio announcer he was very versatile
2044187 i know what he loved to do the most he loved his audience
2044188 the world is a little less funny now that bob is gone whether it was hosting a morning show writing and producing brilliantly funny commercials managing a station or selling advertising he did all of them well and had the best time doing it
2044189 i wish everyone in radio could experience the pure joy he brought to his work every day the audiences loved him his clients loved him and his colleagues loved him

2044350 there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that

2044353 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
2044354 there were as many clash fans on those nights as who fans
2044355 we just finished july with a 95 percent load factor which means it was 95 percent full basically its kind of unheard of in the industry especially in todays economy its really something to talk about
2044356 i think that in the end people in hamtramck will vote in favor of the anti discrimination ordinance
2044357 i dont think its going to be close i think itll be by a wide margin
2044358 hamtramck has to remain a very diverse and inviting community and it has to be the kind of community that people can feel comfortable living in
2044359 were a very tight knit community here in hamtramck its important to preserve that and to respect what it is that other people feel about certain issues
2044360 it is clear to me that mr johnson is stating gay people are to be left out in the cold on the unemployment line and looking in at businesses
2044361 it was clear that he was supportive of discussion and peoples rights i raised the question of are you in support of the ordinance and indeed he is
2044362 the organizing is great and there are really dedicated people on the ground
2044363 after 6 years of intense collaboration with our client cctv our chinese partners ecadi and the engineers of arup we are very pleased to see the successful completion of the exterior of the project on time for the olympics as the building now stands visibly in the city it has added the three dimensional figure of a loop to beijings skyline of towers it appears big yet sometimes small and from every angle offers a completely different perspective and reading we are hopeful to see the building emerge as a symbol of collaboration and change
2044364 many many studies suggest cameras increase rear end collisions and dont improve safety
2044365 the cameras havent been shown to have any real impact on side impact crashes either
2044366 you really cant rely on the goodwill of an employer if hes given this information
2044367 they may be entitled to have it but they should still exercise discretion
2044368 people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
2044369 be kinder than necessary because everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle
2044370 it showed all the solar panels on the rights of way in europe and you know the light went off and it was why dont we do that here
2044371 how we address the challenge of improving and diversifying our transportation infrastructure while reducing our overall carbon footprint will define who we are as a people as a state and i believe in the long time as a nation
2044372 for all the talk about a one two or bi national state solution to the israel palestine conflict the reality is that no state solution for palestine is on the near or distant horizon palestine is a series of disconnected pieces whose division into still smaller parts continues month after month
2044373 with the new rsoft component design suite 8 1 rsoft is on the cutting edge of the demands of the optoelectronic industry
2044374 our dedication to providing the latest design and simulation software to manufacturers is certainly demonstrated with this latest release and we will continue to be instrumental to the design process especially the fast moving photovoltaic industry where research and development is critical to the global environment and economy
2044375 i was at geffen when they were signed they were about 16 then and theyve been coming around my house for 12 years in fact alex the singer is my daughters best friend she has a band too the like on geffen with mitch frooms daughter and pete thomas daughter and they gigged together for years im very close to jason alex and sam they come around the house a lot
2044376 an incredibly talented guy very dedicated and prolific for this album alex came in with 103 songs fully demoed the only person whos ever presented me more songs was peter gabriel
2044377 we weeded that down to 30 we recorded 25 and then we chose the 12 that ended up on the album alex makes extremely sophisticated apple garageband demos on his laptop theyre very impressive he really puts a lot into the arrangements of his demos and since hes a multi instrumentalist they have a lot of textures his arrangements dont always stick or determine how a song might ultimately sound but he really invests himself in the process and there were times on this album when we actually borrowed pieces from his demos and flew them into the ultimate recording
2044378 which is a very portable stereo converter and pair of mic pres and phantom power you can sit on a mountaintop with a laptop bring an 87 mic with you plug it in and do beautiful recording alex got really great at it
2044379 and the five of us would bash around arrangement ideas sometimes staying fairly close to alexs but also trying different tempos working out new parts the types of things that a good band can do with songs to alexs credit he knows there are three guys who bring something that he doesnt thats what makes it a band
2044380 but 95 percent of it was done at my house
2044381 i have an api that was in the record plant in new york in 1970 about 400 instruments and just about every mic and amp and keyboard and piece of outboard gear there ever was laughs
2044382 but that worked to our advantage on this album its part of that weird pressurized sound if you go back and listen to the beatles yer blues on the white album theyre actually in a tiny room and it gives it that crazy supercharged sound my room achieves a similar thing when all four guys are playing at the same time
2044383 he sets out on every record wanting it to be new and fresh and original and the artists really respond to that he knows plug ins like nobody ive ever actually invented techniques with plug ins that no one knows and he may be the fastest pro tools engineer who ever lived im not like a blur
2044384 sonically id say alex brought the most to it hes ridiculous about that kind of stuff and has a lot of great ideas i was trying to make it not sound like a typical four piece rock band and the way we made the album lent itself to having a bit of a quirky sound
2044385 theres probably 15 different performances over the course of two years from three different rooms at different tempos maybe even different keys all kind of playing on top of each at the same time its completely insane
2044386 broken pieces of equipment toys always attracted to those unusual moments
2044387 because people get used to hearing the roughs and i wanted them to get comfortable with the sounds rather than being surprised by them later
2044388 halfway through the mix sean would say ive turned this upside down listen to it what do you think sometimes alex and i would look at each other and go stop it and sometimes we were like holy smokes thats amazing hed re pan make something so wet as to be almost unrecognizable print a backward reverb and then put that through an effect there was never a dull moment
2044389 i finally got a number in the united states and thought yes
2044390 i was so happy and then he transferred my call again overseas
2044391 as were trying to attempt a repair on it right in front of us the screen goes out
2044392 the positive security model is safer because you dont need to know everything about attacks you only have to understand your application
2044393 weve felt some pressure from the community to solve this problem learning is the only thing modsecurity doesnt do by adding this one missing piece were completing the features of modsecurity
2044394 people focus ultimately on blocking but people need to view wafs as operational tools that provide situational awareness
2044395 the most important thing wafs do is provide visibility into whats happening only after you have visibility can you decide whether you want to block or just log traffic
2044396 this is a research effort to help establish a good deployment practice for web applications
2044397 bad guys collaborate very well good guys dont do as good of a job
2044398 what weve found is that web applications are deployed and written in a bad way where everything is allowed by default the problem with that is that every day there are new web application attacks and attack types
2044399 if youre writing an application today you dont know tomorrows attack type we realized theres a great advantage to changing the way web applications are deployed deny by default and allow only whats safe if you want an application to perform five functions allow only those five
2044400 is that you dont have to write the rules just record traffic have it write to modprofiler and have a hosted ruleset to protect applications
2044401 the positive security model is safer because you dont need to know everything about attacks you only have to understand your application

2044408 basically its a man in a very colorful jumpsuit with something attached to a long pole going its swooping its swooping its coming around its coming down
2044409 at first when you are reacting to a traffic cone on a stick its a bit hilarious the hardest thing was not to laugh
2044410 it was a learning curve for all of us and there were a lot of giggles along the way
2044411 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
2044412 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
2044413 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
2044414 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
2044415 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
2044416 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before
2044417 if you look at space operas they show flying machines and occasionally people walk on in a pair of rubber ears personally i think the age of rubber ears is over what you need to do is to produce believable digital characters
2044418 following the public consultation exercise both at the memorial hall in oswestry and through our website we are busy assimilating all the comments made

2044421 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
2044422 with the death of slobodan milosevic we still are getting cartoons and stories about the 200 000 people that milosevic supposedly killed only no one could find the bodies
2044423 in sum through a process of monopoly control and distribution repetition and image escalation the media achieve self confirmation that is they find confirmation for the images they fabricate in the images they have already fabricated hyperbolic labeling takes the place of evidence genocide mass atrocities systematic rapes and even rape camps camps which no one has ever located through this process evidence is not only absent it becomes irrelevant
2044424 another occasion for all the tired old propaganda about the balkans wars to be taken out of the cupboard and given one last airing
2044425 all aboard the choo choo train all aboard the choo choo train all aboard the choo choo train all aboard all aboard
2044426 it was only when we got to talk to his friends after his death we found out he had been bullied at school and that tim had multiple visits to the school counsellor
2044427 after his death i got a book out of the library on teenage suicide and i realised i had no inkling he was suicidal
2044428 we didnt do anything about it at the time because we were just too stressed
2044429 he used to bring me home the vegetables he grew at school
2044430 tim had a growth spurt just before he died and was six foot tall and many of his clothes didnt fit
2044431 deep in my heart i would still like to see a ban but this is a democracy and ill go with what everyone decides
2044432 we thought they were the cats pajamas they were so cool they had handles and they didnt rip but before that we didnt have them and we did fine
2044433 its just ridiculous how much we use and throw away
2044434 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2044435 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2044436 ive loved my time at channel 10 and in knoxville
2044437 i appreciate wbir managements understanding response to my decision to leave television and be closer to my family

2044442 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2044443 i myself cried this morning when i heard the news
2044444 how do you know whether it is a robust inspection force really uncovering the bad practices or whether restaurants in that city have poor health practices
2044445 the presence of rodents and insects is certainly disgusting and certainly shows a restaurant is not focusing on food safety
2044446 but the things most dangerous to consumers are the things we would never see unless we had the tools and the training even if we went into the kitchen we would not be able to see the things that would really harm us
2044447 theres a lot of information that needs to come out the exercise of force should be the last thing to be used
2044448 if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them and i dont want people to feel like that
2044449 this has happened before and without oversight it will happen again
2044450 if that is the standard of justice that prince georges county police department and the sheriffs department want to operate i think we have a fundamental problem theyre not allowed to rewrite the constitution of the united states
2044451 there was a search warrant involved in that situation that authorized those activities
2044452 we were astonished that not only did they not apologize but they refused to clear our names
2044453 when i heard about this all i could think of was my goodness this could have happened to anybody
2044454 they bound me put me on the floor kneeling in the corner my mother in law was bound and i saw my older black lab lying there dead
2044455 we will have representatives of many of those generations doing specific things here to highlight their specialty either art music or food

2044457 every visitor will have a chance to participate in making a very large quilt
2044458 that has been an ongoing project for us for a number of years
2044459 this is a quilt were going to finish and hang people can see the intricacy of the needlework and the social aspect of quilting that was such a staple for keeping everybody sane women would get together because you had to have complete that before the cold weather when you needed them it was a very valuable way to enhance your household and stay very social as well
2044460 theyre not putting on an act and theyre not outsiders trying to take advantage of a trend theyve definitely grown up with surfing and its very clear

2044463 ive been playing in japan during the mid season break but have not been able to find my rhythm when my driving is good my putting is off and when i am solid on the greens i have trouble on the tee
2044464 its been like that recently so i hope it will fall into place in brunei
2044465 i will try to win in my first appearance in brunei i missed last years event as i was playing in europe while two years ago i was injured and couldnt play
2044466 i am not too confident with my putting at the moment i am working hard on it as i hear the greens at the empire hotel and country club are excellent
2044467 i am not pleased with my performance this season my driving and long iron shots have been off target but ive spent an average of three hours a day in the past few weeks to fix the problem and i hope it will show at the brunei open
2044468 our schedule will give us time to see who our top competitors will be for the championship season
2044469 it will give our athletes more time to progress from their summer training and prove themselves ready for an opportunity to compete at the prestigious chile pepper invite in october as well as the acc southeast region and national championships in november
2044470 in favor of a government that can manipulate the public powers in order to impose its will because it has lost popular support
2044471 the people want to find solutions via justice what does the government want it wants to set fire to this city caracas they are looking for violence if they do not let us express ourselves peacefully at the voting booths they are looking for us to set fire to the city
2044472 the people must understand that the fight is today or there will be none the fight is for democracy and liberty
2044473 now this sentence is putting a final point on what has been contradicted by sectors of the opposition
2044474 must admit that things have changed in venezuela and that crimes against the public good are punished a serious and sustained effort is being made in venezuela by the institutions of the state to clean up the country and put an end to corruption and impunity
2044475 this supreme court decision contributes to the doing of justice and those who commit crimes irregularities or mistakes can be punished
2044476 pe a does not represent the mercosur parliament and neither the human rights commission because for that an authorization is needed that she does not possess

2044480 i and a lot of my cousins have very fond memories of working in the kitchen and doing picnics
2044481 trying to put together a consensus on anything was insanity
2044482 thats all 55 and older so theres bound to be some veterans there who might want to join especially if they know the post is closer
2044483 after the illegal scheme was exposed by st in the summer of 2007 rather than siding with customers who had been victimized credit suisse group aligned itself with its wholly owned subsidiary credit suisse securities and its corrupt brokers and directors
2044484 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
2044485 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2044486 look at those democrats they cant get anything done in congress
2044487 the edouard response preparation did not affect our ministry following valley
2044488 and edouard was not as ugly his sister dolly so were not having to respond to his needs were going to continue to respond to the needs of recovery related to dolly
2044489 texas baptists are responding again in significant ways following the onslaught of hurricanes dolly

2044491 we have not lost one cent the information in the press is erroneous and malicious
2044492 the food had been fantastic and i insisted on paying for what we had
2044493 alienate a domestic constituency of tremendous political and financial import american jews it may more crucially mean sacrificing billions of dollars not in servicing israels military but actually investing in the state of palestine
2044494 one seemingly consistent theme running throughout barack obamas career is his comfort with aligning himself with people who are anti israel advocates
2044495 the assessment concluded that a golf course on this site would jeopardize the lands fragile ecosystem mature trees and wetlands
2044496 the executive office of environmental and energy affairs and i are concerned that authorizing a golf course at this location would compromise precious open space and natural resources
2044497 this golf course could have been built and up and running
2044498 i think a golf course would have been an improvement to the environmental quality
2044499 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat
2044500 we failed to forge an agreement on the formation of new government as per the constitutional provision and appeal from the president but it doesnt mean that an agreement is not possible from now on
2044501 we could not agree on the common minimum programme and ministerial portfolios
2044502 the days of meetings could not even enter the issue of cmp power sharing ministerial allocation code of conduct and on who should lead the government cannot be finalise
2044503 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2044504 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2044505 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2044506 there are lots of free things for the baby and anything helps
2044507 i have to start thinking about that even though i dont want to
2044508 its a way for them to find out who they need to call when they have a question about something
2044509 its also a way for them to meet and network with other women who are sharing the same experiences
2044510 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all
2044511 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
2044512 the spice girls reunion tour was a very healing experience for me it put to bed every bit of doubt guilt insecurity i had about leaving the girls when i did i felt id made amends with them
2044513 the only interactive agency to take creativity strategy and technology out of silos and develop a truly blended approach to creating emotionally resonant online brand experiences
2044514 it was really hard work but we had fun and it was nice to help out
2044515 there was a still a lot of wood left when we were done so were talking about getting another group together later to help
2044516 well if we had someone like obama maybe he would listen to what we have to say
2044517 well maybe im open to something that might involve drilling id be willing to swallow it
2044518 who is this person and why are you all fighting over who sits at the front of the room
2044519 both the issues committee and academic enhancement group said obviously the board is not interested in looking at that reform package at this time so we wont move that forward
2044520 the no 1 thing with our coaches is to maintain the 56 games both of those groups felt that we dont want to constantly take these issues to the board especially when the board is not interested in hearing it and take their attention back to the 56 games that is of utmost importance and we dont want to lose that
2044521 as coaches we have to make a great attempt to try and speed up our game basically i think its for the good of the game for the good of the player and especially for the good of the fan
2044522 it has grown in length every year people dont want to sit through a four and a half hour game you lose the fan base and you lose television the issues committee talked about that for a long time and had some great suggestions so coming shortly we will have a conference call with coaches for this to be discussed as coaches we have to discuss this and everybody make an attempt to have a well played game in shorter time
2044523 this is an area that we need cooperation from several constituencies
2044524 we need our umpires to move the game along and we are asking our coaches and administrators to support them in this effort
2044525 were having to go far and wide to find this oil at three times the cost from a month ago
2044526 geneva rock is one of the largest asphalt suppliers in the state on monday they had to cut their customers off and scale back their own crews the cities and counties are a huge source of revenue not being able to supply them hurts us hurts the whole industry

2044528 our street crews cant do any patching until we get the asphalt back again provo has several streets with partially finished trenches where utility crews made repairs they are waiting for asphalt
2044529 right now were telling them try not to do any new if you can but if repairs come up we have a half way decent solution to it temporarily
2044530 for the past ten years we have designed industry niche products to perfectly match flat panel displays the leon ethos has always been to give custom installers the versatility to design systems that fit individual needs the profile 404 x a gives the option of not only matching any tv but also wood floors or any wall paint colour it not only looks great next to the display but it stands on its own as an incredible two channel solution that customers will want to show off
2044531 toris neighbors are fed up with all the noise and traffic but tori tells them to just deal with it
2044532 this used to be a quiet neighborhood but now its being treated like a studio lot the neighbors wish tori and dean would move out

2044543 any problems that may affect the access of people with a disability will be rectified as soon as possible
2044544 as most disabled people are on pensions and money is always an issue this website had the potential to be of great assistance to us if it had been designed correctly
2044545 it appears that the site was put together in a hurry with little thought of allowing disabled people access and most certainly was not tested by disabled people before it came online as any good website should be
2044546 ive had people already tell me that theyre not finding the grocerychoice website terribly useful
2044547 i think it would be fantastic if weve got a national website that does help people but im not sure that this is it

2044556 i prepared the track records then as part of some routine chores done by the special forces
2044557 he acknowledged he made some mistakes and he has learned from that
2044558 hes an important player and he plays in a position where it is easy to be the captain
2044559 some of the others who could be captain are a bit young in our team when youre 21 you look old
2044560 he got a lot of criticism after what happened at birmingham but until then everyone said he was a fantastic captain so i think he deserves another go to show his commitment then we will see where we stand at the end of the season
2044561 he has a good evaluation of his own performances thats what makes the big players i believe if you speak to a big player after a game he can always assess what he has done right and wrong
2044562 its not that we dont want him its that we arent organized around who will be attending what their role will be or what were going to do there
2044563 perhaps they thought by ignoring it that it would just go away but you cant blow off a national party leader no matter what you may think of him
2044564 but it also reflects the ongoing struggle conservatives have had with this candidate
2044565 when your most prominent surrogates are mitt romney and carly fiorina and you basically treat conservatives like second hand citizens you should expect to take some heat most conservatives like and admire this president and like and admire this vice president i think its fair to say that level of affection does not exist over in crystal city site of mccain headquarters in northern virginia
2044566 molti mi scrivono che le firme non sono servite a nulla che faranno quello che vogliono comunque le firme sono servite per contarci molti mi dicono che i vday sono stati come una botta e via i vday sono serviti a vederci toccarci sorridere e affermare il nostro diritto a gridare che siamo vivi siamo ancora vivi non ci hanno battuto e non ci batteranno mai molti mi dicono che tutto questo non servito a nulla se berlusconi ancora l se la p2 e la mafia sono in parlamento ma loro sono il passato non li vedete vivono nella paura nelle leggi speciali nellesercito il futuro bellezza e loro non ne fanno parte per questo sono tristi per questo vinceremo noi prendendoli per il culo

2044569 scusate non sono sicura di aver capito stiamo parlando dei referendum vuol dire che non li faranno
2044570 la lettura sistematica delle tre norme ci induce a ritenere che nelle ipotesi fisiologiche la fase della raccolta e del deposito possa essere effettuata nel periodo dei 9 mesi salvo quanto disposto nellarticolo 31 che lo riduce a soli 6 mesi naturalmente non essendoci precedenti relativi a questo particolare caso qualsiasi interpretazione deve poi misurarsi con leffettivo pronunciamento dell ufficio centrale del referendum presso la corte di cassazione
2044571 ma vuoi vedere che anche le vendite dei dvd e di altri gadget sono fatte per contarsi e io che pensavo fossero per far cassa
2044572 350 mila firme che accompagnano il ddl diniziativa popolare per la non candidabilit al parlamento degli inquisiti
2044573 era pubblico il suo reddito mi pare lo scrivemmo allepoca tra laltro
2044574 un po come per il v day alla fine non se n fatto niente
2044575 c qualcuno che sostiene che in parlamento non debbano esserci criminali e non capisco proprio come qualcuno possa avere da ridire su questa cosa
2044576 ragazzi non capisco davvero di cosa stiate parlando non sono un grande estimatore di grillo ma lo sono della verit il fatto che le firme del v day non siano servite a niente assolutamente falso perch le stesse sono state portate a palazzo madama contrariamente a quanto dite voi
2044577 non dimostrato che se uno morde un poliziotto alla gamba in parlamento lavora peggio di chi al poliziotto gli ha baciato il piede
2044578 molti mi scrivono che le firme non sono servite a nulla che faranno quello che vogliono comunque
2044579 il comicpolitico pi famoso ditalia ha finalmente ammesso che le firme raccolte durante i vday per i fantomatici referendum salva italia sono inutili
2044580 innanzitutto non lha detto lui inoltre chi parlava di questo intendeva che le firme non avranno alcun effetto pratico perche magari le ignoreranno non che non fossero valide
2044581 qui si parla delle firme per i tre referendum su legge gasparri giornali e pubblicit
2044582 350 mila firme che accompagnano il ddl diniziativa popolare per la non candidabilit al parlamento degli inquisiti
2044583 ma guardi che grillo ad aver detto che le firme non sono servite a nulla
2044584 scusate ma le firme non valgono potevo accorgermene prima ma in fondo dovevamo pur contarci no beh lo abbiamo fatto
2044585 350 mila firme che accompagnano il ddl diniziativa popolare per la non candidabilit al parlamento degli inquisiti e uniniziativa precedente a questa
2044586 ora dal momento che la mia argomentazione era in soldoni non vero che le firme non servono a niente perch sono state presentate
2044587 una raccolta di firme per fare un referendum sulla gasparri utile se si fa il referendum sulla gasparri altrimenti no
2044588 das geht einen schritt weiter als die meisten phishing seiten

2044590 bei der n chsten aktualisierung der crawler liste sollte das behoben werden
2044591 i think hed be good at it and have thought so for a while
2044592 obviously everybody sees what he does with the ball in his hands
2044593 so we thought maybe we can get him two or three extra touches a game you never know what hes going to do
2044594 i dont mind them being 5 foot 9 or 5 10 as long as they can run and jump
2044595 i have no problem with it but if you can get another prototypical guy like l a on the field with darcel mcbath or a anthony hines or jordy rowland those guys are big theyre tall theyre physical they give you some advantages that a 5 10 corner doesnt
2044596 its not affecting my legs or anything so im out here running around making plays
2044597 ive been recruited by texas tech for quite some time now and ive gotten close to the coaches
2044598 ive developed a really good relationship with them when i was out there the last time i really felt like i was at home
2044599 ive been told my best characteristic on the field is good footwork
2044600 im not about playing games and stuff like that i feel good about my decision
2044601 im a big fan of wrestling and apparently he wrestled in high school which slipped past me
2044602 wrestlings a lot more tiring than it looks like so i dont think ill be doing that too often
2044603 but i talked a few guys into it i talked to graham and then louis vasquez followed and then marlon winn followed once marlon grows it out he wants to dye his so im excited about him doing that
2044604 has been addressed and that appropriate actions have been taken
2044605 we were glad to hear spectrum health has taken this incident seriously our goal has always been to raise awareness within the healthcare system so that another couple will not have to experience what ashleigh and i went through

2044608 georgia will withdraw its unit from iraq to give a proper response to russian aggression
2044609 of all the target groups it is the smes that show the least interest in applying for eu funds
2044610 the reason for this is the lack of trust they have in the way eu funds have been allocated in bulgaria
2044611 because of this mistrust they deprive themselves of millions of euro in funding
2044612 this funding is aimed at them not at the bigger companies who have other means to finance their work such as banking institutions
2044613 what people read and watch on tv is continuous reports about abuse of eu funds
2044614 and if you ask me if we did the survey now because of the report the situation would have been made worse i think the report made an extremely negative impact on smes
2044615 this is what needs to be changed for smes to get out of their corners and start exercising their rights
2044616 usually authorities rely on information campaigns to make people and companies more aware and active it is a good solution but most information campaigns are insufficiently imaginative we usually see tv spots showing farmers and their gardens which to me look like scenes from communist times what people need is detailed and accurate information about where and how to apply not general information
2044617 as part of a small ngo i had to fill in a form and let me tell you it was not easy
2044618 of course unlike smes municipalities are part of the state machine and therefore can exploit all its advantages
2044619 after we published the surveys results headlines such as bulgarians dont care about eu funds were sprawled across newspapers which is totally wrong eu funds as a rule are aimed at businesses not at individuals you cannot expect everyone to know and have detailed information about them but this extreme attitude is something that bulgarian media like
2044620 people should know that the success of smes funding means success for entire society
2044621 furthermore people should actually know what eu funds are who their targets are and why the system of allocating them works that way then and only then will people have a more positive view towards eu funds
2044622 eliminating third party spending limits is a blatant and undemocratic attempt to let big money steal the election from farmers it is unacceptable that large multinational companies will be able to spend more during this election than the people actually trying to represent farmers
2044623 mr harper and his government must give farmers a real choice by ensuring that all votes take place in a free and fair way instead they have imposed illegal gag orders fired directors numbered ballots threatened opponents are trying to take the vote away from many producers and are now allowing big money to do their dirty work for them
2044624 this governments reckless disregard for the democratic rights of farmers should concern all canadians mr harper has tried to open the flood gates of american style big money election campaigns in canada before but the courts said no now he is trying to do the same for cwb elections
2044625 why is mr harper so afraid of real democracy for farmers
2044626 no vendor can go it alone in uc so im glad cisco is realising that
2044627 uc is basically a melting pot of communications products right now
2044628 any vendor that has any kind of communications or collaboration tool claims to be a uc vendor
2044629 we shave our ice to make more than 60 flavors of hawaiian shaved ice which seems to be a real treat for so many during the hot days of summer
2044630 it takes a lot of knowledge to operate a business but with all the equipment and machinery utilized to purify the water and make the vast quantities of ice it takes a special someone to keep everything running smoothly
2044631 larry van landingham has been a true asset to our store
2044632 last summer during our busiest time of the year the ice bagger broke after numerous calls to try and locate a replacement part there just wasnt one to be found larry decided to try and fix it he took the equipment apart and was able to have it welded locally we were back in business in a few hours
2044633 this year the store has been busier that ever weve been bagging ice night and day to keep up with demand the hot dry spring and summer have created a rise in consumer demand and the dry weather has also led to many forest fires we delivered ice to both the trigo and big spring fires by making deliveries to belen mountainair and estancia supplying ice for the firefighters
2044634 mark van bommel is predestined for the role since training resumed at the end of june i have been able to assess the excellent way in which he leads the team to the point that he enjoys considerable respect from all the players from the youngsters to the older ones
2044635 the st lawrence river is something that if it werent there beaconsfield wouldnt be what beaconsfield is
2044636 this is the same for all the other cities that are in front of the great lakes
2044637 ive proposed that the government create a junior minister for water
2044638 they told their mps we just want to create another bloated ministry
2044639 bring a lot of people together who normally dont come together if you ask them the right questions maybe youll get the kind of answers you need
2044640 drab and dreary and ordinary like a throwaway episode churned out between sweeps months
2044641 im a little disappointed that as a professed long time fan of the show youd add to the negative press that the film is getting but then again i realize this is your job all i can tell you is that its worth seeing a second time dont know if that would improve your impressions but theres almost universal agreement among the fans that it improves considerably on second viewing the plot makes more sense and the nuances of the ideas in the film come through and you have to admit that they did some interesting work with mulder and scullys characterization separately and together i found it really satisfying to see that these characters had matured in an organic way since the series ended in 2002 and that their relationship had taken on a new complexity new layers etc i really enjoyed the movie and think fox did it a disservice by releasing it in the summer right behind the dark knight with way too much secrecy and a resulting failure to manage viewers expectations about what this movie is actually about
2044642 they forgot to bring in a story it reminded me of the first star trek movie where we spend half the film looking at the enterprise however the subsequent films were far better and worth seeing i have a feeling that this was of the same vein and that the waters were being tested neither star has really been in the public eye since the series was cancelled
2044643 were spending time working on all the situations that are involved in football that define football teams
2044644 when you turn on highlight shows and you see highlight reels that summarize games its situational football
2044645 were focused on those elements of our game because hopefully if were good in those areas it will give us a chance to be great
2044646 were trying to develop the makeup thats going be our playing personality we desire to have which is a tough hardened football team thats good at situational football
2044647 well know more about our team friday night and were looking forward to that
2044648 we will be in effect broke and i want to use that word broke
2044649 the city council by their move has essentially decided they are going to bankrupt the memphis city school system in two years
2044650 our coaches would never ever encourage our children to do anything illegal
2044651 this team is still something to be very proud of
2044652 the government is feeling comfortable with progress on the new vehicle tax regime because the figures for the first six months of the year which reflect cars delivered are more or less the same as last years but this year new car importers have received far fewer orders than last year
2044653 this has already started showing in the figures for june and july and will be felt more and more in the remaining months of 2008
2044654 at least we will know what the new system is we will be in a position to order vehicles according to the new norms to be introduced in the coming months and the maltese will know the price they have to pay for these vehicles
2044655 acim understands that under the new tax system small cars will go down in price in our opinion this decrease is not enough because medium sized cars will cost the same and large cars are going to go up
2044656 this measure will negatively affect maltese families with children because they need a medium sized car and these are the cars that are taxed the most
2044657 under the new tax system new cars are not going to be significantly cheaper
2044658 the bottom line is that we know that our water meets all municipal standards the quote from gartner lee was that most municipalities would kill to have water as good as ours
2044659 the city failed to insulate the water meters and related piping
2044660 other than the roof this is a pretty solid building
2044661 do you want the bad news or the worse news
2044662 i went on one roller coaster like three times in a row
2044663 were opening like 400 doors only for the handbags worldwide
2044664 of course you have ups and downs but she gets back on her feet
2044665 the events of the last five weeks highlight the profound importance of dns to the proper functioning of the internet and the critical role nominum plays in protecting it
2044666 our customers around the world demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and ability to address this problem quickly and efficiently their confidence in nominum built on a long history of stable and predictable software releases allowed them to upgrade rapidly without disrupting their networks or operations
2044667 nominum has a strong track record of delivering software that works the first time
2044668 we were able to upgrade our servers and secure our high speed internet service in advance of the threat without any disruption to our customers
2044669 the st lawrence river is something that if it werent there beaconsfield wouldnt be what beaconsfield is
2044670 this is the same for all the other cities that are in front of the great lakes
2044671 ive proposed that the government create a junior minister for water
2044672 they told their mps we just want to create another bloated ministry
2044673 giving back to our communities has always been a significant part of our rich history as a co op
2044674 as we celebrate our 70th anniversary we are proud to continue that tradition and partner with many wonderful organizations making a positive impact in the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people nonprofits play an important part in getting people active outdoors and caring for the shared places we all enjoy
2044675 lenders who were willing to lend 75 percent of say 2005 values now are only willing to lend 60 to 65 percent of 2008 value which is typically lower too
2044676 to give a simplified example yesterdays 75 million mortgage on a 100 million property turns into a 54 million dollar loan 60 percent of now 90 million value on the same property when it comes due
2044677 theres a big opportunity to fill the resulting gap with higher interest second mortgages on high quality properties with strong owners
2044678 when you put god first in your life anything is possible
2044679 lopezs drive was internal all the other guys on the team realized that and they stepped it up
2044680 when he saw his name on that list and knew that he was going to a new home that was a turning point
2044681 when we were in africa we didnt know what was there for us as kids we just ran
2044682 god was planning all of this stuff for me and i didnt know
2044683 the test went perfectly we used a bumpy portion of road which included the sort of sequences of fast corners you find on the barum rally the session gave me a chance to get to know the people at kronos and bfgoodrich
2044684 i was also able to find my marks with the peugeot 207 s2000 and i soon felt comfortable with it it is faster than the mitsubishi i usually drive more precise and more efficient through the corners
2044685 i have good knowledge of the bfgoodrich dry weather range since i use bfgoodrich tyres in the czech championship however the a10 seems to work differently on the peugeot 207 it then started to rain and i used the g force profiler w00 for the first time i was surprised by how much the grip it gave in the wet i cant wait for the rally to start
2044686 we lament that in this case the arrangements established by the vienna convention treaty were not followed
2044687 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2044688 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2044689 you start to lose your memory you start to lose your confidence you start to lose your invention so i think thats pretty much a closed book for me
2044690 i told my sister yeah its one of those austin things i am doing tonight
2044691 when you have multiple children it really adds up so its good to have a free thing in the evening and you can bring your own food and drinks and they enjoy that
2044692 i am sure other kids will enjoy it i know my kids do
2044693 if he got the death penalty i think thats too good for him
2044694 das reich wird f r nicht katholische konfessionen gleichartige regelungen treffen
2044695 the core hypervisor that is part of xvm server has been available as part of open solaris for some time
2044696 each copy of xvm server includes an embedded web server that allows it to be managed remotely via a graphical user interface in a browser on any os you choose with no local software installed or via a web services api
2044697 one of our goals for xvm server is to give you the power of a true enterprise class virtualization solution but also make it instantly familiar to people using tools like xvm virtualbox
2044698 the pca is always a special tournament for poker players especially because the location is so great there are so many online qualifiers and the atmosphere is very special players are usually much younger too and i know many more of them as we always play with each other on pokerstars
2044699 republican presidential hopeful john mccain said he was seeking blue collar and heartland support during a visit to the sturgis motorcycle rally earlier this week but some of his comments have generated more controversy than support
2044700 i was looking at the sturgis schedule and noticed that you had a beauty pageant and so i encouraged cindy to compete i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
2044701 i did not start the final of the champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement
2044702 i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2044703 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league this year with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2044704 it is vital that the game takes a step back and concentrates on making the right choices
2044705 we have the strongest and the most entertaining league in the world we should celebrate that not denigrate it
2044706 i thought why me i didnt know how to handle it i didnt know anyone with diabetes there was no familiar face in music or sports that i could connect with but i started to see it as an opportunity to be an inspiration to a generation that doesnt openly talk about having diabetes and not feeling embarrassed by the disease
2044707 i remember when i was first diagnosed i was like i can do this and then sometimes it became alright i need somebodys help so id say can you do my needle for me today its ok to rely on other people and just be positive and keep going the biggest challenge is managing it before i go on stage and making sure i keep a watch on my blood sugar throughout the day its always very important there are times when you cant really help what happens to the sugar because part of it is kind of unpredictable but to be able to live my dream by being in a band shows that anything is possible even if you have diabetes
2044708 it was a somber trip theres no better words to describe it
2044709 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2044710 i wish the packers well and i certainly wish the jets well and i hope that i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had in the last two or three days
2044711 as hard as i worked in green bay and as much as i prepared and got myself ready its different this is much different and its very exciting
2044712 this is the second car ive brought by to fill up
2044713 the oil companies have been screwing us for months now its our turn
2044714 we can confirm that the divorce is final they remain the best of friends and their family is obviously the priority
2044715 im as excited as ever for creamfields this year as always ive worked alongside chibuku to put together the chibuku and annie mac presents arena where im playing alongside ian brown erol alkan and 2manydjs this year sees the launch of the all new annie mac presents tent its a smaller tent and gives me an opportunity to showcase lots of new and exciting acts like little boots and frankmusic plastic little and clik clik ill be doing my weekend radio shows from there too so that along with the fact that its creamfields 10th birthday makes for a mammoth weekend

2044720 if this is to be debated in public for too long clearly it could be detrimental to the market in terms of making people think about whether to proceed with a transaction
2044721 at this stage it comes down to the company being liquidated or entering a deed of company arrangement which should provide a better outcome for creditors
2044722 i dont think they interested parties know the scale of this or the amount of warranties
2044723 were providing further information to them we will see if some will take over the work for nothing or charge customers a small fee
2044724 there was never any issue of us owing dues until january 2008 when someone in the local office tried to say we owed it
2044725 we paid within days even though we werent officially notified we paid six months dues but we were told that we had not paid dues and that our membership had lapsed they are trying to take away our membership on technicality
2044726 the uaw constitution in article 45 section 1 specifically states that a shop committee person terminated by the employer and who has a pending grievance remains a member and can run for any open office thats pretty cut and dry
2044727 normally the ieb conducts factual hearings but because of ieb prejudice we are asking that the prb itself hold this one
2044728 the prejudice is demonstrated in two ways a according to a witness statement in the record the local expelled the five on the recommendation of eunice stokes administrative assistant to uaw president ron gettelfinger given in a phone conversation in january when stokes did not know and did not inquire about all the facts and b the ieb ordered the trial last fall to go ahead on the theory that the five lied to members in the strike by saying it was authorized though the charge didnt allege that and every witness on both sides agreed at the trial it wasnt true
2044729 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
2044730 it was the best experience of my life thus far
2044731 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2044732 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2044733 its an extremely powerful experience im just extremely proud to be canadian today
2044734 they have really done something well never see again a big elaborate coming out party for china
2044735 the performance is the perfect coming out party an amazing performance and something chinese people will be so proud of
2044736 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape
2044737 its not going to be a mad rush at the end
2044738 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2044739 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2044740 our gas price drops over the past month have averaged more than a penny a day but during the month before prices peaked they were going up by over two cents a day
2044741 were still a long way away from the 3 price averages that we paid this time last year consumers should continue to shop aggressively for the best prices and seek out those stations charging less than 4 a gallon if they are along their routes
2044742 we called the platoon leader and the response was are they dead yet
2044743 here on birth regulation we have ended up in a bottleneck above all because of the distinction cast into doubt even by medicine between artificial and natural as if even from the moral viewpoint what is important is the trick of cheating nature
2044744 never in the 150 years of the papers existence has an editor of the tablet been presented with a problem of conscience and policy so grave as that which confronted me with the publication of humanae vitae
2044745 someone however who is competent in the matter under consideration and capable of forming a personal and well founded judgment which necessarily presupposes a sufficient amount of knowledge may after a serious examination before god come to other conclusions on certain points in such a case he has the right to follow his conviction provided that he remains sincerely disposed to continue his inquiry
2044746 no one should therefore on account of such diverg ing opinions alone be regarded as an inferior catholic
2044747 spouses may responsibly decide according to their conscience that artificial contra ception in some circumstances is permissible and indeed necessary to preserve and foster the value and sacredness of marriage
2044748 only if the reasons are serious and well founded if the manner of the dissent does not question or impugn the teaching authority of the church and is such as not to give scandal
2044749 may the lively debate aroused by our encyclical lead to a better knowledge of gods will
2044750 produced shock and or solace suspension silence pretty much in that order
2044751 if dissent is to be taken seriously within the community it cannot be viewed as simply legally tolerable a kind of paternal eye shutting to the errors or immaturities of a child
2044752 they just cannot accept that the use of artificial means of contraception in some cir cumstances is intrinsece inhonestum intrinsically disor dered
2044753 if we the synod fathers listen to all the different points of view
2044754 theologians and pastors whose learning faith discretion and dedication to the church are beyond doubt
2044755 has always recognized the principle and fact of doctrinal development
2044756 this problem is not going to be solved or reduced merely by a simple reiteration of past formulations or by ignor ing the fact of dissent
2044757 the act of artificially limiting the exercise of one faculty of life is intrinsically evil while the act of exterminating life itself is not
2044758 foregone conclusions virtually imposed on a so called consultative body
2044759 many would compare us bishops to a dysfunctional family that is unable to talk openly about a problem that everyone knows is there
2044760 the churchs teaching on contraception does not belong to the category of matter open to free discussion among theologians teaching the contrary amounts to leading the moral con sciences of spouses into error
2044761 each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life
2044762 are particular ly capable of seizing the deeply reasonable and human character of this fundamental principle
2044763 expresses the total reciprocal self giving of husband and wife
2044764 i am confident that most catholic couples would be incredulous at the propo sition that the use of artificial birth control necessarily makes their sexual intimacy selfish dishonest and unfaithful nor is their valuing of parenthood based on their experience of isolated sex acts as having a certain procreative structure
2044765 the conjugal act capacitates them for the generation of new lives
2044766 since they always remain ordained towards expressing and consolidating their union
2044767 not only because of the reasons adduced but rather because of the light of the holy spirit which is given in a particular way to the pastors of the church
2044768 what are contemporary moral theologians to make of roman declarations on sexual morality that they regard as too unnuanced are they to remain silent or is it their task to dissent to give a more nuanced inter pretation
2044769 i believe that the theologian after mature reflection has the right and many times the duty to speak out against widersprechen a teaching of the magisterium and to support his dissent
2044770 therefore if the influence of events or of the times has led to deficiencies in conduct in church discipline or even in the formulation of doctrine which must be carefully distinguished from the deposit of faith itself these should be appropriately rectified at the prop er moment

2044773 they shared drinks and then had a tryst in a car
2044774 the following year the beauty queen was given a state job as a researcher in a field office above a cigar store by 2006 her salary jumped 42 percent to 30 000 plus she got a 7 000 bonus
2044775 told investigators that she got her state job after having sex above a pittsburgh cigar shop with manzo
2044776 it would be wrong to take retribution against those who told the truth
2044777 one of the finest families among all of my acquaintances
2044778 anyone who believes that the allegations in this presentment were masterminded by mike manzo for his benefit are very naive
2044779 no leader can be involved at that tactical level day in day out and if you have many people theres just too many people
2044780 the opening of four points by sheraton beijing extends the brands presence in greater china and provides comfortable lodging at a great value for both business travelers and leisure customers
2044781 four points by sheraton gives travelers just what they want and need comfortable accommodations free internet access in the public areas and the space they need to work or relax
2044782 we already know you called us by looking at our phone you dont really need to say anything that takes too long to listen to
2044783 its not so severe that every time i go out im like oh no shouldnt do anything i could puff up and die ive got it under control
2044784 during the winter the ozone whatever it is the inversion yeah thats bad
2044785 were working a lot with the schools we want the students going to school to participate in the activities they have there so we do education for teachers and have an online program for coaches and p e teachers to learn about asthma and how to help the kids manage it
2044786 i remember being in elementary school and all my teachers knew i had an inhaler and knew what to do its real important cause then your teachers not going whats wrong with this kid
2044787 businesses like this show that the economic slow down should have little effect on the uk job market
2044788 we need to keep extending opportunities to disadvantaged people in times like this

2044792 business colleagues of mine believe that certain companies which are not members of the ispai have meanwhile earned a significant amount of money through irish businesses and irish consumers but do not seem to have done much in return
2044793 ultimately we isps are the ones with this landing on our abuse desks and we are dealing with it on a day to day basis law enforcement cannot work at the same speed
2044794 i simply think policing porn online is the job of the garda
2044795 we will be putting limited quantities of notes and coins on sale every year
2044796 this increase could be enough to push certain households into debt or further into debt but this is by no means an isolated instance todays consumers are facing substantial increases across the board from food and petrol to gas and electricity the cumulative effects can be devastating for many there may simply be no way of finding another 227 per year which works out to almost 5 per week
2044797 centrica is the second energy supplier to put its prices up we expect this sequence to continue across all suppliers forcing more than 1 million households in england into fuel poverty across the uk fuel poverty could affect 6 million households by the end of the year
2044798 with so many demands on their budget consumers are facing some tough decisions
2044799 they may feel forced to juggle their debts using credit cards or even to neglect some bills so they can pay others
2044800 as debt advisers with 15 years experience we strongly advise against either course of action however serious someones debts are there are far better ways of handling them the important thing is to seek expert debt advice and to do it sooner rather than later
2044801 some people may be able to free up the necessary extra funds by learning to budget more effectively or by renegotiating payments to their creditors
2044802 in todays economic climate of course the kinds of debt help available may be limited as problems in todays credit market are keeping some people from accessing the debt consolidation loans that could help them regain control of their finances
2044803 debt management for example relies not on access to further credit but on negotiations between an individuals creditors and the debt management professionals who ask them to accept lower monthly payments and grant other concessions as always we would recommend that anyone in financial difficulty seek professional debt advice as soon as possible
2044804 achieving this goal zero carbon will establish britain amongst the world leaders
2044805 ls has seen this problem burgeoning co2 emissions from it coming and our long term research investment has produced management tools that allow it managers to be informed intelligent and proactive about their use of energy installing intelligent power management alone frequently leads to energy savings of 30 or more
2044806 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
2044807 a data protection strategy should be top of the agenda at board meetings online backup centralises resources and apart from giving companies a significant roi it also gives an intangible benefit of knowing your data is stored offsite and immediately available
2044808 and having keepitsafe on board is yet another testament to the facilities we can offer successful irish companies
2044809 when we starting kayaking scotty was always with us when we would go to events and things
2044810 sometimes it got us closer and sometimes it gets you further apart
2044811 id say at the age of 10 he was actually pretty doggone good at that size and at that age
2044812 but the body heat of three people plus down sleeping bags kept us ok
2044813 his easter breaks and christmas breaks were spent in north carolina and washington d c at training camps
2044814 this is a very tough course it only takes one slip and somebody is out
2044815 the game went pretty much as we expected in the beginning
2044816 the first 25 minutes were hectic and they threw everything at us
2044817 the referee made a bit of a mistake and that meant we had to dig deep but this group have an unbelievable team spirit and they were too proud to crumble
2044818 hopefully they made a few people at home proud too
2044819 in my 12 years as a coach ive never seen a performance like tonights
2044820 we believe the gun he shot himself with was the one he used to shoot officer pulliam
2044821 the entire thing is a tragedy for all families involved
2044822 officer pulliam was a valued member of this organization im sure the suspects family is suffering also
2044823 the family would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support
2044824 we ask for privacy while we grieve and also ask that you keep her pulliams only daughter in prayer as she copes with the death of her mother
2044825 said that if i left him or he went to jail he had nothing left to live for
2044826 thats the first time hes gone away and not gotten in touch
2044827 he mentioned to me one time im gonna kill her but it was all talk i believe
2044828 i saw all the warning signs now that i didnt see last week and the week before last
2044829 he just snapped i never witnessed him once even raise his voice even when things got really bad
2044830 the work and holiday visa allows young people from australia and our partner countries who want to travel and experience a different lifestyle and culture to work and subsidise their travel
2044831 this new arrangement is an investment in future relations with indonesia and will also help develop links between people in both countries
2044832 it will provide a further incentive for young people from both nations to deepen their understanding of our histories cultures and economies
2044833 its a joy that runs through your body it shiver runs up and down your spine and its something i cant explain to tell you the truth
2044834 i get to see people accept the lord and i get to see people shout and raise their hands they come around and brag on you sometimes too i like that
2044835 they are not promoting to keep the singing a going like they use to
2044836 i know i dont have too many years to go as long as the lord lets me go im going to be singing
2044837 its been very difficult to deal with the fact nobody has seen or heard from her nobody
2044838 i am very upset with the med they didnt notify me
2044839 when we checked her in and brought her here she came and was here about 15 minutes she sat in the chair she said she come back out and she was gone
2044840 its hot outside shes in a very unfamiliar area we just want her back safely
2044841 i have always wanted to record a live album but wanted to do it right
2044842 some of my favorite musical heroes willie nelson and merle haggard taped live albums at billy bobs so its a career highlight to record my live album in the same venue
2044843 they were probably chosen because they grew so fast and could provide a lot of shade very quickly the canopy of one willow oak here provides shade for more than a quarter of an acre
2044844 we have aerial photos from the 30s that show these trees as little saplings theyre interspersed with a number of old mature trees now those trees are dead and those young trees are these mature beautiful willow oaks we have to make sure over the next five to 20 years that were replacing them with new trees just as they replaced others before them
2044845 its like an oasis in an urban grid ive lived in the neighborhood for years always run around it and have used it as a park much of its character comes from the trees
2044846 one of the first things you think about when you arrive on east campus is those trees they are part of my life at duke its a heartbreaker when we lose one
2044847 there are already some great cherry trees in front of brodie gym and along perry street
2044848 it would be nice if you could get the whole path this linear path to broad street would be come a great cherry walk it would be very visual and symbolic
2044849 these trees are large and theyve been here for most of our lives
2044850 were monitoring it step by step it seems to be on time and on budget
2044851 where is the most dangerous place in israel right now
2044852 whoever thinks the problem of jerusalem and terror are specific and that destroying one house or another will help is burying his head in the sand the main question is does the government want jebl mukaber or sur bahir as part of israel or not
2044853 it is in israels interest to rid itself of these neighborhoods and villages that were never jerusalem and that endanger the jewish and zionist nature of the city
2044854 peres said that there must be a separation between the arabs of jerusalem and the jews and that it must be in the form of a wall
2044855 whoever thinks its possible to live with 270 000 arabs in jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more trucks and the carrying out of terror attacks
2044856 the bulldozer attacks may stop but the kassams will start
2044857 there was a lot of confirmation of my strategies that we need to get more troops into afghanistan and that the iraqis are willing to take more responsibility
2044858 theres no doubt particularly as bush has adopted policies in the direction of obama that that gives obama bragging rights
2044859 pleased to see that there has been some convergence around proposals that weve been making for a year and a half
2044860 weakness sowed the seeds of world war ii hitler could have been stopped easily when he marched into the rhineland you cant negotiate evil away
2044861 the river is choking with filth effluents from all the cities and industries drain into the river unchecked and it affects the lives of nearly 500 million people
2044862 at current trends the world will fall short of the millennium sanitation target by more than 700 million people
2044863 only tottenham have dared continue negotiations but as it stands nothing has developed
2044864 my desire to leave is still as strong but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle
2044865 i understand perfectly well that if i dont move on now i probably never will
2044866 im just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say weve had enough of arshavins whining lets let him go
2044867 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2044868 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed
2044869 when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move
2044870 i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2044871 a short while later a representative from spurs arrived to discuss my personal terms and contract
2044872 the discussion didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up
2044873 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
2044874 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the premier league and play against the likes of manchester united chelsea and arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
2044875 i am sure tottenham will be back to make another more suitable offer for arshavins transfer
2044876 there is no set time period or deadline for this
2044877 we used to have a school a gin house a corn mill two more stores and a lot more its pretty much all gone
2044878 its nice to last that long and be able to celebrate
2044879 weve done a lot of work and a lot of planning
2044880 its been a good place to live i grew up here went to school here its been a good life
2044881 we believe this facility is imperative for our nations security and we are confident san antonio provides the best location and opportunities for the national bio and agro defense facility
2044882 you also have a very strong capability in military veterinarians that have worked with exotic foreign animal diseases so the collaboration with nbaf would be strong here
2044883 my mum watched a game of afl on tv after it was recommended to her and she sort of pushed me into it and said there you go you can play that sport so i have her to thank for being here
2044884 ah jack glad its you i wanted to have a little word with you about your eating habits
2044885 that will have to wait sir a reports just come in that theres been a burglary in william street and the poor woman involved is in a terrible state they got in through the back window terrified her pinched her life savings and stole her deceased husbands war medals im going round there right away and need a bit of back up is it all right to take pc smith with me
2044886 now now jack you know full well the procedure to be followed just give her a crime number and we maybe able to get someone round in three days tell her not to disturb anything tho otherwise it could upset the forensic bods you couldnt take pc smith with you anyway hes filling in his request forms for more biros we seem to be using rather a lot these days and not only that but you know how many officers we have off sick with writers cramp
2044887 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
2044888 garys mother was very close to her both sons and was waiting for gary to return from sri lanka
2044889 we actually got in on june 9 but the outside and the landscape was not done because of the rain they finished around july 2 and we are very happy with it
2044890 justins our first one to start school and it is exciting
2044891 i think hes excited too it will be good for him were looking forward to coming back
2044892 the coaching staff gave me the opportunity to play in different situations last year and i give them a lot of credit for showing the faith in me
2044893 some of the injuries we had on d with zubov and boucher out for a good part of the year were hard we had a really young defensive group because of it and i felt like i could bring a little bit of leadership because i was the second oldest one after norstom after those injuries
2044894 obviously playing the minutes and getting the chance to play on the power play with the talent we have on the roster was big and also on the pk it was just nice for me to participate a little more it was a perfect storm for me sometimes when stuff like that happens someone has to step up and as the whole defensive group including the young guys stepped up their game we were able to accomplish a lot as a team
2044895 last year was great but obviously we came up short of our goal
2044896 but it is a step in the right direction going into this season we know what we can do and we know we can compete against teams like detroit and san jose and anaheim and thats what we have to focus on we want to try and make it further and bring the big trophy back to dallas
2044897 my first year in montreal i got a chance to play with eric weinrich
2044898 he was 34 at the time and he was basically the leader on our defense he was really good to me and took me under his wing both outside the rink and on the ice i was his d partner and i learned a lot from him after coming to dallas we had hathcer zubov matvichuk and sydor you can learn so much by simply practicing or being around them i think a guy like matti norstrom really helped me too not as much last year because of the injuries but when we first got him i was paired with him and i think he was a good veteran defenseman who knows the game hes not flashy but he is truly effective in what he is doing out there he was a great role model for me by his presence outside the room and on the ice too
2044899 you have to stay in shape thats part of the game
2044900 i took a bigger break at the end of the season because i had surgery on my nose i started later than i usually do but everything has been going well ive been pretty serious about it
2044901 i couldnt really breathe well after i broke my nose again in the playoffs
2044902 i went for surgery not to look better but for my health especially as a professional athlete obviously being able to breathe in our sport is very important in the long run this surgery should really help me and improve my performance on the ice
2044903 i dont have a small nose ill never have a small nose unless i go for a bigger surgery
2044904 ive been feeling really really good ive been working out a lot i havent done a bunch of cardio yet but ive been feeling good its a good sign
2044905 that poor bloke who was identified as the rapist by cctv we had the exact same thing happen to us
2044906 it has been the biggest hassle i have ever had to go through they were negligent in the way they handled the whole situation
2044907 i have no police record now i apparently do and that is what we are trying to get rid of
2044908 the police are under so much pressure to charge someone my son should never have been arrested
2044909 the evidence we have seen over the last week in relation to the use of cctv shows up the danger in that it could be any one of us that does the right thing
2044910 development of the national broadcast code for the republic of trinidad and tobago was prepared by the authority in 2005 where it said it got numerous responses for changes to be made to the draft
2044911 there is a recent trend from people from government or state where they would try to belittle reporters at press conferences
2044912 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment
2044913 merck has been a tremendous partner in our mission to help the worlds poorest communities
2044914 for years merck like map has been committed to helping people in impoverished countries who are unable to attain medical care together merck and map have saved lives
2044915 since the programs inception our goal has been to expand access to our medicines and vaccines to people in need
2044916 map is a trusted partner that we rely on as we work to meet that goal
2044917 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2044918 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2044919 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2044920 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
2044921 either way we need to keep every option open if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2044922 its up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage
2044923 iran confirmed its message when it stood against the whole world to deceive and to reject their aim is to obtain an atomic bomb
2044924 two years ago we saw the price thats paid for a lack of an experienced leadership nevertheless today were equipped with a good understanding to prevent this from happening again
2044925 former illinois football players dustin ward qb robby long dl and bobby jackson s all experienced their fair share of camp rantoul practices
2044926 all three returned for one more go around this time as coaches the trio are on the depauw coaching staff and came out to practice to get some last minute pointers before beginning their own preseason preparations next week
2044927 dustin ward robby long and bobby jackson all former illini and all coaches now at depauw university watched illinois wednesday practices at camp rantoul
2044928 he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed
2044929 he is a manchester united player hes happy to be a manchester united player and hes always been happy here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life that has made it difficult for him
2044930 the important thing is that we have ended all this stuff about real madrid and he will as he gets older appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here they never want to leave
2044931 its unusual for anyone to really want to leave united and i think that cristiano realises that
2044932 we had a good meeting in portugal we clarified a lot of things and thats why i was confident everything was going to be all right
2044933 i think they real now know they are dealing with a different animal and i think cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2044934 he has got four years left on his contract and hopefully at some point we would like to extend it
2044935 the trainers think theres a decent chance that he can play friday
2044936 he was hurting but he said i can run the bases
2044937 im a little quicker than casey its a good thing they left me in the game
2044938 today is an off day thats all i know if i feel good ill play bottom line
2044939 we gave him a standing ovation just in case you wanted to know
2044940 the dpp didnt even have in their summary statement that the knife inflicted a wound
2044941 this transaction allows medianews to manage its balance sheet during a challenging economic environment and transfer ownership of the connecticut post to a company we admire
2044942 weve been playing this game a long time this is not our first rodeo
2044943 in fact we expect to announce another transaction with hearst shortly which will better position us to weather the current economic storm
2044944 last year we invested more than 12 million in acquisitions without recourse to debt or our shareholders
2044945 these accelerated levels of investment one off gains from divestments and contributions from acquisitions make it difficult to compare profitability between the first half of 2008 and the comparable period in the prior year
2044946 it gives us an opportunity to look back at the 1970s through the filter of 2009 the issues of privacy and individuality and issues of spying and listening are as relevant now as theyve ever been this is the perfect vehicle to tell those stories
2044947 the effects of marijuana on appetite have been known for millennia from its medicinal and recreational use
2044948 the ingredient responsible stimulates cannabinoid receptors when you block the cannabinoid system with an antagonist like taranabant you suppress appetite
2044949 all we have here is 12 weeks we dont yet know what will happen at six months or a year
2044950 drug that targets cannabinoid receptors cuts appetite burns more energy
2044951 im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2044952 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
2044953 pankaj was already a part of the big fm family his extensive experience and knowledge will help serve and create great value for our customers
2044954 i look forward to the journey ahead and working with the team i am sure we would continue to deliver great value additions for our clients through our various offerings
2044955 immunitys very important because you have the chance to f up and not get fired for it
2044956 i believe that citigroup should not have agreed to this arrangement and new york state should not have pressured the company to do so
2044957 impact on earnings will not be meaningful the need for more capital due to this event is non existent
2044958 strength coach mike joseph told me what to eat and what not to eat and stuff like that i was able to do it because of mike joseph
2044959 he had me on the cardio machine and on the treadmill and its all because of mike joseph that i was able to do it
2044960 he is in the shape of his life boy he looks good
2044961 i thought it felt comfortable weighing 205 pounds but at the bowl practice i had felt sluggish and slow
2044962 there is a big difference now with my speed breaking on the ball and running now i just feel a lot better now
2044963 when i first got here last year in the spring i was like im not going to be able to do it the in the summertime before last season i just worked on it during the season it came to me
2044964 junior college we only ran like one or two coverages
2044965 it was either man or cover three here with coach lockwood coach dunlap and coach casteel we run one two three four and six and thats a lot to learn i have to work on my zone coverage more and my zone turns and everything it was a lot different
2044966 its a lot different from coach gibbie to coach lockwood everything is different coach lockwood wants his technique coach gibbie didnt really care how your technique was as long as you were getting there
2044967 coach lockwoods man to man technique is like shuffle shuffle step he wants to shuffle and if you dont shuffle he wont put you on the field
2044968 coach lockwood doesnt like having a field and boundary corner
2044969 he wants a right and a left so we can learn both sides with coach gibbie it was learn the field side and be a field side player or learn the boundary side and be a boundary side player
2044970 coach lockwood wants you to know everything he will be testing us if there is a blitz on this play what safety rolls down he does that so we can know everything that is going on
2044971 i am learning a lot of football since coach lockwood came here
2044972 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
2044973 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2044974 there were people deceased from the front of the bus to the back of the bus
2044975 the injuries i saw were primarily crushing wounds trauma as youd expect in a situation like this
2044976 poverty crime and unemployment rates are high in the study target area
2044977 do you sit around a lot because of a lack of energy
2044978 when elderly patients complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old
2044979 they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
2044980 unraveling the causes of anergia will expand the scope of geriatric interventions that enable aging persons to preserve their quality of life

2044982 now i just hope to begin moving forward and continue to work for the county
2044983 i thought it was a good race i just wish more of my supporters could have gotten out and voted
2044984 the candidates did a lot of work people just arent interested
2044985 we had a lot better turnout than we thought we were going to have
2044986 to help them with their academics character development really partner with families in the community
2044987 we hope the community is excited about it the neighborhood is excited we really hope they people in neighborhood will take ownership of it and make it their own community center
2044988 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2044989 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2044990 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2044991 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2044992 judith tavano has strengthened ties between the university and the school district
2044993 now we have direct contact with someone who is dedicated to helping us find professional development opportunities she has made it easy to find folks at the university who can provide information for teachers for example our 12th grade teachers have the important responsibility of writing college recommendations for their students just like that judith found someone at the university whose job it is to evaluate those recommendations to deliver a workshop for them
2044994 people with similar positions from all the districts around are invited to quarterly meetings so when someone is doing something others can benefit from we hear about it
2044995 they were empowered to take control in the classroom telling their students that education would continue as it always had

2044998 the integrity of the rest of the championship is at stake
2044999 im not saying durham deliberately prepared a bad pitch but if theres no penalty they and other teams with strong seam attacks will always want these sort of pitches
2045000 the game is going to be a shambles and we wont produce test cricketers the pitch panel asked all the usual questions but apparently they think there was nothing wrong with the pitch its not sour grapes because i would have said the same if wed won
2045001 its ridiculous and i cant say how bad we feel about it even shivnarine chanderpaul couldnt score runs on that pitch if the ecb are not going to do anything about pitches like that why waste money sending inspectors round the country
2045002 the ball has swung consistently and sometimes it has slipped off the seam but there has been no extravagant movement or variable bounce
2045003 there has been moisture around after all the rain but there was no obvious sign of moisture in the pitch it was a typical durham pitch but for some inexplicable reason the ball has nipped around
2045004 both times we have had a pitch panel in my four years here kent have been involved they are used to playing on good pitches in the south
2045005 there are still kinks being worked out in the mme and the curriculum
2045006 i think in a couple years well start to see that the standards have increased the grade level content expectations have increased and kids taking the test will catch up to what is being assessed
2045007 in our district third through eighth grade meap scores were very strong and the declines we saw at the high school level were marginal
2045008 we have 35 to 40 teachers at the high school who are in their first four years
2045009 we know theyre strong in content and we welcome the infusion of new talent but we also understand that if you lose experience it might have an effect on achievement

2045017 this is an example of why some african americans have troble advancing
2045018 infections have in fact been rising among men who have sex with men as the data shows a steady increase since the early 1990s
2045019 these data among men who have sex with men point to an urgent unmet need
2045020 these new estimates paint a soberingly accurate portrait of the aids epidemic and reveal an utter lack of investment in prevention research and programs especially for gay men and african americans
2045021 rather than investing in domestic hiv prevention the u s government has cut funding to state and local health departments by more than 28 million since fiscal year 2003
2045022 neither the u s house of representatives nor the u s senate has proposed any increased funding for hiv prevention
2045023 this is completely unacceptable particularly in light of the new incidence numbers
2045024 an awful lot of money is being spent but we dont know how much of that is being spent effectively
2045025 it becomes very difficult to advocate for more resources if we havent evaluated what we are already doing
2045026 jesse helms era restrictions on proven means of effective prevention the pernicious intersection of hiv and major social injustices such as racism and homophobia are important contributing factors that must also be addressed
2045027 better numbers tell us that we need to better target and tailor our scarce prevention dollars
2045028 gay men and other men who have sex with men of every race and ethnicity are the single largest group affected by hiv aids in this country under funded cookie cutter prevention is no longer viable if we want to control the epidemic in the united states
2045029 this should serve as a bombshell wake up call to both senators obama and mccain that americas response to domestic aids has failed we need a comprehensive national blueprint for ending aids and that blueprint is a national aids strategy
2045030 its an interesting time for search engines the strategy for cuil is an unusual one it wanted to go head to head with google
2045031 for us we didnt want to be eating googles lunch thats not a very sensible thing to do you dont go up to the biggest boy in the yard and nick his lunch on him
2045032 what we want to do with heystaks is bring something else to the table we want to work with google
2045033 were providing an overlay on top of google it is still the same good old google results but with annotations so unlike cuil we dont suffer from the problem of not having a good basic set of results we have the best set of results money can buy as it were but we are augmenting them with heystaks
2045034 the thing thats missing is the ability to organise your search experiences and the ability to share your search experiences
2045035 were so used to the idea of organising our word documents into a set of folders so that it is easy to find them again and were used to the idea of sharing information with other people by emailing them
2045036 unless weve gone to the trouble of saving that page or bookmarking it which quite frankly the vast majority of people dont do
2045037 were left with the need to re find things so the first thing heystaks said was lets help people organise their searches in a more meaningful way that is where the idea of staks came from looking at what people are searching for a lot of it tends to fall into different topics
2045038 each stak is like a vertical search engine driven by google it is a very interesting way of parcelling up the search engine space
2045039 i dont think graduates see social care as a career opportunity weve also got an ageing population so where is that workforce going to come from its not so much a skills shortage as a people shortage where are we going to get the social care workforce from
2045040 we need to be innovative in recruiting more people i wouldnt say no to a graduate scheme it is something i am considering bringing in but the question is how we would mould it so that graduates and the employer could get something out of it
2045041 to be able to stand in an arena with world class champions and call myself a world class champion its a very overwhelming beautiful thing

2045046 because larger numbers of jellyfish eat the plankton there is less food for the fish so it is a vicious circle more and more jellyfish less and less fish
2045047 the species is commonly known as the mauve stinger which is seldom seen in the netherlands but is very common there
2045048 to be honest i havent found many arguments to support this the mediterranean has been severely polluted for decades especially in certain areas and there has not been much change there so why would that cause so many extra jellyfish all of a sudden
2045049 he used to write to me every place he was at in germany and iraq and say theres no place to fish
2045050 one of the things that all of us used to do when we were growing up was fish it was the one thing that kept us out of trouble
2045051 the performance will reflect the cultural aspects of chinese society and showcase what modern china and its people are all about
2045052 we have prepared for the beijing olympics for seven years and now we are ready we are very confident indeed that we will stage a successful olympics
2045053 of course we hope that these will be a great games even the greatest
2045054 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges
2045055 i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
2045056 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favourite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat
2045057 the couple is very happy and look forward to enjoying their honeymoon
2045058 we hope that many will be those whose choice to give a contribution openly in favour of marriage and the family overcomes the choice to remain silent because of the fear of criticism
2045059 this situation which developed after the last general elections leads us to make the following considerations
2045060 the church in her reflections about the human person and strengthened by the word of god believes that marriage and the family are of fundamental benefit for the individual and society
2045061 the christian community may and should give its contribution in this discussion because the human person is the way of the church
2045062 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce even if it may appear to solve some difficulties for individuals has serious and lasting consequences on the common good of our society the experiences of other countries bear witness to this
2045063 the benefit of divorce is for the failed marriage couple to start a new life and for their children who can only benefit from having happy parents
2045064 every sensible man every honorable man must hold the christian sect in horror
2045065 christianity is the most ridiculous the most absurd and bloody religion that has ever infected the world
2045066 melt down of relations between parents and children the collapse of the family unit
2045067 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe a in my name shall they cast out devils b they shall speak with new tongues c they shall take up serpents and d if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them e they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
2045068 the question is not about allowing the victims of failed marriages to lead separate lives or to cohabit this is already being done on a large scale and with variable degrees of justification it is about rewarding this state of affairs by according it the same status as a true marriage at a terrible cost to the rest of society and to the concept of a stable and durable christian marriage
2045069 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce even if it may appear to solve some difficulties for individuals has serious and lasting consequences on the common good of our society the experiences of other countries bear witness to this
2045070 those who think that divorce seperation annulment is a solution would better look at the children who have experienced such situations and then make judgement
2045071 test drive before marriage does not guarantee a marriage for life
2045072 bishops urge the faithful to back marriage without fearing criticism
2045073 oh no the church is imposing its beliefs on us
2045074 but i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness causes her to become an adulteress and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery
2045075 fir rizq it tajjeb u l hazin fil mard u fis sahha nibqa nhobbok u nirrispettak tul hajti kollha
2045076 no divorce for catholic malta never god is with us and the pro divocist satan shall have his head crushed the eucharist the rosary and the teaching of the catholic church will strengthen the maltese families for ever
2045077 all gods are homemade and it is we who pull their strings and so give them the power to pull ours
2045078 those who think that divorce separation annulment is a solution would better look at the children who have experienced such situations and then make judgement
2045079 those who think that divorce seperation annulment is a solution would better look at the children who have experienced such situations and then make judgement
2045080 it was because you were so hard hearted that he wrote this commandment for you
2045081 so do not judge the archbishop regardless of whether you agree with him or not since he is much more intelligent than you are
2045082 the report youre mentioning was based on incorrect information divulged in parliament by minister austin gatt over which the same minister had subsequently apologised to the house already
2045083 overcomes the choice to remain silent because of the fear of criticism
2045084 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce
2045085 research studies done in countries where divorce is legal show the bad effects divorce has had in these countries especially on the children of the divorcees
2045086 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce
2045087 christians and those who believe in this value of marriage and the family should commit themselves according to their responsibilities
2045088 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce
2045089 hes probably got a fan base here in chicago you know but i also fought here once the fans accepted me and treated me good and i hope that this time therell be no exceptions the fans in chicago are really good and theyve welcomed me so far and im looking forward to this
2045090 hes got tremendous power in his hands hes been knocking everybody out ive gotta respect that and use my boxing abilities in the ring its not like i havent faced his type before i fought julian letterlough in 2001 and i won the fight i hope tomorrow night wont be an exception
2045091 im willing to face anybody but right now im not focused on anything else but tomorrow night i dont care what happens in the future the future is tomorrow ive just gotta win this fight no matter what its gonna be a tough fight man its a big opportunity that i cant let go to waste ive just gotta beat this guy and hopefully with my ring experience i can do it
2045092 well its very good its very active tarver and dawson are fighting i think in october for the ibf title and tavoris and myself are fighting for the number one spot so its a very active division its gonna be a good division to fight in for awhile
2045093 if i got the opportunity to fight zsolt erdei id have to go back over there and those are fighters that dont come out of their homes and i dont have no problem going over there but right now nothings looking or facing that way right now its facing toward cloud and thats it
2045094 i consider this a do or die fight i dont know how many more chances im gonna get
2045095 it could be my last chance so ive gotta take full advantage of it and go all out

2045098 were very excited that sada is the first google enterprise partner to produce and host an event like this
2045099 for the past 40 years we have teamed up with the worlds finest outdoor athletes who constantly redefine the limits of what is humanly possible and provide us with invaluable first hand insights
2045100 they inspire us to explore and push our own preconceived notions of what makes a successful company and brand
2045101 this new activity based structure expands our business opportunity and strengthens our ability to bring the best products to the consumer
2045102 were reaching new specialty points of distribution and broadening the meaning of never stop exploring
2045103 the outdoor industry is a perfect platform to introduce new participants to the joys of the outdoors and the importance of conservation
2045104 to ensure future athletes consumers and conservationists the north face is committed to increasing participation in the outdoors through improving access and conservation of both the front and backcountry
2045105 thus far faced a year of significant challenges ranging from natural disaster to uncertain global economy
2045106 the chinese hotel industry will be looking to the olympics to provide the profits in 2008
2045107 many of the new hotels in northern china were developed specifically to meet the needs of the olympics it will be interesting to see if chinese markets can adapt the new supply levels when the games move on
2045108 stefan sonnenfeld and company 3 and i have worked for the last three months to get the print looking like what you saw no matter how good the cinematography is there is new potential to make the image more impactful beyond what you can do on location or on the set so when you do blu ray you have an up rezing quality so things that were sharp before become sharper
2045109 things that are dimensional like the dragon lunging at the camera in blu ray really knock your head off because you are seeing all the details we put in it that are even a little better defined
2045110 the dark light values are better so you can be darker and still see all the detail plus you have many more layers of ancillary material and much more information
2045111 it will sound better on that blu ray than in any theater in america
2045112 no one has come to me for that yet but i would so be down for that i really hope they do in fact im calling universal studios home video i didnt even think about that
2045113 commissioner beck and i talked by phone last night and he very graciously called and conceded the race and offered his hand of friendship to move forward i asked him if we could have coffee next week and talk a little bit to make sure we out all he is the county commissioner and i respect him in that position
2045114 electronic trash is toxic trash and we need to make more of an effort to divert it out of the waste stream
2045115 were talking about doing a collection in october but my big thing is seeing if these can be recycled
2045116 we need to keep these things out of the waste stream
2045117 the more we divert trash from the waste stream the better it is environmentally and the better it is financially because we pay more to have that trash hauled away
2045118 the u s believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2045119 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2045120 we cant expect the american people to jump from capitalism to communism but we can assist their elected leaders in giving them small doses of socialism until they awaken one day to find that they have communism
2045121 buckhead landlords in particular will need to be aggressive in order to secure leasing commitments with 2 million square feet in the pipeline tenants will be able to pick and choose among many available relocation options
2045122 we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations for the company and restores value to our shares
2045123 we are determined to do so and this is our focus
2045124 i hope in the remaining nine months we make up for the lost time and push through some legislature and some non legislature measures if we dont that will be tragic we lost time because of the left parties which said without their consent we could not move forward
2045125 i sincerely hope those political parties which support the legislature measures in the committees will also do so on the floor of the house if they dont that will be tragic those members who point out that we are losing time and recommend passage of bills in the committees should help in pushing the reforms agenda
2045126 a view from the outside why good economics works for everyone
2045127 i have nothing against the left parties we only disagreed in spite of depending on their support from outside though we were able to work together on various programmes in the social sector such as the national rural employment guarantee act the right to information act etc we could not work together in some other areas
2045128 because of the fractured polity there is very little we can do in a coalition government we can only lay out an agenda and try to implement as much as possible in five years there is no great by partisanship in this country as we have so many political parties chidambaram observed hence my appeal to the people is vote for your idea of india and to a political party which comes closest to that idea my pitch is for democracy in which people deserve a government that delivers the only way a government can deliver is to vote for a party that gets a working majority then you see things happen
2045129 and call up any of the entries flying the banner charges mr
2045130 eu rule on airline passenger list checks will open gates on illegal immigration
2045131 this will allow the european court of justice to rule that steps to control illegal immigration which it does not like are
2045132 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
2045133 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
2045134 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
2045135 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
2045136 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
2045137 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
2045138 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
2045139 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
2045140 islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
2045141 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
2045142 maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god

2045147 about two and a half years ago we began praying at memorial about having a second campus and moving into the multi site concept of doing church
2045148 zero plus zero equals zero you cant keep something perpetually on life support
2045149 our solution was to shut the church down have them relocate to our original campus and integrate
2045150 there are some families out there that i could not be more proud of for taking this on as their mission
2045151 we knew the demographic of the northeast area theyre young families out there we designed something specifically targeting young adults
2045152 we are able to work our relationships to earn the right to share christ to witness to authentic live faith
2045153 people come before the service just to talk and stay 30 to 40 minutes after the service just to talk or grab a cup of coffee not to say that the traditional model cant be that but in essence its not driven by the same priorities
2045154 in fact ive never been an aspiring musician ive always been a musician but i never really focused i was always running away from what i was supposed to be doing
2045155 i dropped mine in the toilet for about thirty seconds and i was so gagging and jonesing that instead of going and getting it replaced i had to buy a new one immediately i couldnt survive for two days without an iphone
2045156 i have a few interns you know im running my own label
2045157 its a difficult time in the industry because anybody that comes calling you kind of know theyre about to get fired even if theyre the head of a label
2045158 its a top shelf product you know its not like a debut grungy self produced released indie thing its more like ive been doing this a long time and this is a culmination of years work and you know its already been licensed a lot people are responding really well to it its genre bending its a mindfuck people love it so weve got a great product but we dont have a big machine behind it
2045159 i dont want to be cheesy and over the top but its one of those things when youre just there for somebody no matter what they do and its that kind of unconditional love and acceptance thing
2045160 it was originally written by michael hutchence of inxs just before he died and it was demo version not the version that i have and danny saber who worked with michael on a lot of stuff and also worked with seal and madonna and david bowie after michaels death he wrote this incredible sixteen piece string orchestra arrangement but the actual song itself melodically and the words and everything was still just kind of a scratch track so i came in and i heard the string arrangement and immediately i started working with him we finished the song we gave it some more production
2045161 so its my favorite song this week the great thing about this album is the material is the kind of material that it can grow on you and then you can get a little bit tired of it but its never just that yeah yeah yeah its really annoying i never wanna hear it again you know i come back to it and i continually because i think we finished the album about a year and a half ago as is often the case with these projects they go on and on i go back to it and its still fresh
2045162 does anybody buy cds i dont know anybody who buys them
2045163 im not at all concerned with having a skeleton on the album instead of me its my guts and my garbage hey theyll either swallow it or theyll spit it out

2045204 bagi kami forum ini wajar dihentikan demi kebaikan semua pihak kerana memang jelas majlis peguam cuba memainkan sentimen perkauman katanya

2045234 there can be little doubt the construction sector is now firmly in recession
2045235 indeed with housing market activity and prices continuing to head south the commercial property sector in dire straits and government finance for infrastructure projects limited the construction sector looks to be in for an extended very difficult time
2045236 this reinforces our belief that the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008 even allowing for the fact that the construction sectors share of national output is relatively limited at some six per cent
2045237 we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2008 our efforts during the first and second quarters of 2008 to increase our net interest margin and maintain our solid asset quality really paid off for us in the second quarter on a sequential quarterly basis our margin improved from 3 00 to 3 28 from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008 and our asset quality remained solid during and at the end of the second quarter of 2008 i am appreciative of all the great efforts of my teammates and the support of our clients and our board of directors in helping us to achieve these results

2045261 the czech republic is a team that will spread the floor and they can be considered a finesse basketball team this is a team that will have size and athleticism but will not be as strong as the americans they really match us on the perimeter with some of their players eva vitechkova and jana vesela who will find ways to score however they cannot match a sylvia fowles or a lisa leslie inside in the post they will have a tough time against the depth of team usa it will be tough assignment but dont be surprised by the score this will be a great opening game and team usa will get tested right away
2045262 there are a lot of emotions im juggling right now
2045263 im excited but im also nervous because of all of the history around this usa basketball team but its obviously an incredible opportunity i get to play with some of the best athletes in the world and theres no other place that id want to be
2045264 right now were focused on our team but we understand this tournament is going to be very competitive
2045265 everybody is a threat and we wont be able to relax against any team thats the mindset we have to come in with we need to put people away early on and not let them hang on
2045266 its great and i havent had that wonderful experience in a while
2045267 its so nice to just lob it up there into the post and know that sylvia will go up and get it and its good to see that shes healthy enough to be out here and to know that shell contribute

2045269 i am thrilled that seimone and sylvia are going through this experience of a lifetime it is such an honor and i feel like a proud father to know that they will not only be representing the united states but the lsu womens basketball program as well

2045274 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2045275 these results indicate that atos origin in the uk has returned to growth

2045279 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2045280 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2045281 like all within the bsb community we are deeply saddened at the loss of craig jones following his accident last weekend
2045282 the british championships formed a large part of craigs career and i know he kept a keen interest on them as we did with his world championship exploits
2045283 each person on the board is acutely aware of the employment challenges in our county and wants to do what we can to help
2045284 many of us believe that tourism is an area that can be expanded upon and this amphitheater can be an integral part of the tourism picture
2045285 dramas depicting our local history summer camps musical concerts and outdoor church services can be held there in fact uses for the facility are limited only by our imagination
2045286 we can visualize a restaurant near the site a new hotel nearby and people flying in to the airport to enjoy an evening of theater and dining
2045287 hopefully someday visitors can arrive on buses or fly in for a weekend of theater dining golf swimming canoeing and relaxing in coshocton county
2045288 i dont see how anybody could do something like that
2045289 officers were able to locate a garden hose nearby and they actually doused the flames on our victim
2045290 if youve ever lit any significant amount of gasoline you know what that sound is and thats exactly what he heard
2045291 both sides have a strong desire to find a resolution
2045292 we both have the same goal to adequately serve the medicaid population and ensure adequate capacity

2045294 i was going to play a stonewall but i have to wait until he plays d4 to play f5 otherwise he can play d3 and e4
2045295 hes waiting until i play bd6 to play g4 so im trying to find other useful moves
2045296 im feeling pretty happy now because i got to play e5
2045297 at first i cant believe this guy just giving me a pawn 18 bxc3 19 bxc3 qxe3 but then i realize he wants to play nd4 and its great compensation
2045298 i need the second rank clear for my rook ra8 a7
2045299 ok i take a second pawn im gonna defend this
2045300 and what am i gonna do if just queen back he takes on h7 and then mates me
2045301 im sure this is lost for me if i make a move like be5 hes going to check me on f5 then c8 and then he takes the c6 pawn and i can resign so i find the only move
2045302 now my king gets to c6 in time to defend the pawn
2045303 he should take the a pawn right away and then return the queen to g8 this must be winning in the game he takes later and gives me some important tempi to push my g pawn
2045304 i think this move is his last chance to make a draw he has more checks from e2
2045305 cobol is still used by most banks governments and big businesses

2045311 this approach will reduce the need for significant customization and ensure that we benefit from ongoing partner upgrades and platform enhancements
2045312 while oracle is delivering the platform for the star direct business we will plan the second and subsequent phases of our next generation platform strategy in parallel it is at the end of this planning phase estimated to be approximately six months from mobilization that we will be able to provide further detail on how we plan to sequence this multi year journey and who we will partner with for the core banking system replacement
2045313 these programs for the olympics are really designed to sort of draw listeners into the larger febc program so that they can first hear these programs that are very interesting to them theyre not specifically evangelistic but then we hope theyll want to stay tuned and listen to the evangelistic programs we sure hope they find christ like so many thousands already have
2045314 we have always maintained a very positive relationship with the government thats what allows us to broadcast so many hours a day of christian programming without being jammed we really try to comply with the government regulations so that we can have the long term opportunity to broadcast the gospel to china

2045341 the upgrade reflects the city of johannesburgs strengthening operating performance driven by a growing tax base and subsidies from the national government
2045342 also reflects higher provisions for asset depreciation which help to self finance its investments now approaching r5 billion up from r1 billion in financial year 2004
2045343 we are very excited about the investor confidence that the rating has shown it means the city has done a lot of good work
2045344 the ratings could be upgraded further if easing macroeconomic tensions help to alleviate rising cost pressures on the municipalitys operating performance and if the sale of its r2 billion net debtor book is completed successfully providing the municipality with corresponding liquidity
2045345 johannesburgs operating performance continues to be strong underpinned by tax and fee collection rates of about 95 percent
2045346 estimated income per capita of about r60 000 is approximately 40 percent above the national average and should help to underpin an average operating revenue growth of close to 10 percent tax and fee rates linked to inflation and the continual expansion of the tax base should help to maintain a good match between revenue and spending
2045347 income inequality and the still high percentage of population infected with hiv remain the main burden on future economic growth with their demand for higher social and health costs over the medium term
2045348 a potential burden stems also from pension and potential unfunded liabilities which the city seeks to control by implementing self insurance policies

2045351 the murder of martin highlights the potential fatal consequences that may result from carrying knives and other weapons
2045352 in this case an innocuous meeting of two groups of youths escalated in to a series of confrontations resulting in martins tragic murder
2045353 the investigation into martins murder has established that any of those youths involved in these confrontations could just have likely become the victim in this case
2045354 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us forever

2045356 the key parameters for negotiating final draft legal texts with respect to each of these issues
2045357 each of the trips issues has its own terms of reference and particular subject matter

2045371 but what these kids go through in chemotherapy and the days that they spend at the dana farber institute is nothing compared to what we have to do for a couple days
2045372 thats an emotional part of the whole weekend for us
2045373 jeff was our pedal partner from day one being our third year and spending the last two without him its a difficult thing
2045374 its good to be associated with a family like the hayeses
2045375 they have such a strong community and theyve really supported our ride we appreciate all of their support and were happy to ride in jeffs memory
2045376 thats never going to go away thats always going to be near and dear to our hearts as to why were doing this everybody has their own significant attachment
2045377 she is a great inspiration to a lot of guys that ride with us
2045378 what shes been through as a younger girl and just recently this past year she went through another round of chemotherapy her will and determination and how she gets on that bike year in and year out is amazing
2045379 the board has the authority to determine the number and location of schools and appropriate the necessary resources to maintain them
2045380 the choices facing the school district three years ago were difficult but an honest disagreement over a policy decision and claims of illegality are two very different things
2045381 contrary to the taxpayers assertions the boards initial ten year plan was not set in stone the plan made clear it was preliminary and subject to change
2045382 while the community desires detailed information regarding the districts 10 year facility plan it also recognizes the need to modify the plan when necessary to respond to change in enrollments and program needs school mergers including possibly creating some kindergarten through 8th grade schools may occur during the 10 year plan period mergers will only be undertaken with extensive public input
2045383 while we sympathize with the taxpayers and their desire to maintain their neighborhood schools the board has the authority to determine the number and location of schools and the appropriate resources to maintain them the taxpayers failed to prove the board acted illegally or exceeded its jurisdiction
2045384 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved game franchises was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character
2045385 its great to have gemma on board for such a popular gamers game as command amp conquer red alert 3 we hope that fans of both gemma and the command amp conquer universe will be delighted at what they see when the game goes on sale in october she will also be taking part in ea s be the one event in trafalgar square later this year which forms part of the london games festival
2045386 i can not keep something if i dont give it away
2045387 thank you for real love real support and real heart
2045388 the numbers started out pretty good just over 1 5 million tuned into the premiere episode but the audience has dropped off denise has turned into an unappealing reality star
2045389 viewers were disgusted that a mother of two young girls would use such foul language
2045390 these data add a new twist to the association and suggest that periodontal disease may be there before diabetes
2045391 we found that over two decades of follow up individuals who had periodontal disease were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life when compared to individuals without periodontal disease
2045392 this could be suggestive that the people who lost all of their teeth had a history of infection at some point but subsequently lost their teeth and removed the source of infection
2045393 this is particularly interesting as it supports previous research originating from the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study invest which has shown that individuals lacking teeth are at intermediate risk for cardiovascular disease
2045394 i know they dont want us to organize any activities during the olympics

2045399 these trainings offer an exciting opportunity for settings to focus on aspects of running a successful small business
2045400 participants will explore the dynamics of programme administration and capitalisation of local resources to develop a more robust service for children families and the community
2045401 they see training as a priority and enable staff to attend
2045402 the question that were trying to get to the bottom of is why havent they been doing them consistently
2045403 i would like to say that this is proactive but it may be reactive it is probably a bit of both
2045404 the department probably has stricter need than other departments our employees are out there theyre out at playgrounds out at pools i want the people of dedham to feel comfortable with our employees
2045405 if there were some people that werent checked they will absolutely in the next week or so
2045406 im not an attorney im a parks and recreation commissioner the motion that was there was on a fine line legally
2045407 we really think we have a good nucleus to build around our expectation as we set out every year is to be conference champions i think its possible weve got to work hard and everybody knows that
2045408 we have some big shoes to fill in kull mcclurg and eric saunders but we have a good attitude the kids are working hard our skill players are going to get better as the year goes as they gain experience but we have a line to build around and we need to do that
2045409 weve got two starting running backs back we feel like we could win the conference
2045410 aaron grimmett is one thats going to have to step up and probably jerry herman
2045411 we expect big things from jerry this year running the football steve simonsons got to step in at quarterback he was mostly a wide receiver and were expecting big things from him theres a bunch of kids that need to come through for us on our offensive line
2045412 thatll probably be the key to our team this year were more experienced
2045413 the first three games are the meat grinder for us
2045414 buckeye usually has a tough line theyve got good running backs who are fast theyre just a good program and its usually a good game with us
2045415 weve struggled right at the beginning the last couple years
2045416 well come out of the gate 1 2 0 2 and stuff like that weve got to do better we want to get off to a good start against norwayne and play a little better defense that first week
2045417 avon and edison are tough if we can get through those tests right there thatll give us a good idea of how we can do in the conference
2045418 chinese people are not like the american people its not like they can go to another game for them its hard because they cant get a visa to visit different countries
2045419 they e mailed us back and it seemed like they were professionals they were but professional crooks
2045420 we started feeling a little suspicious when they kept changing the dates of the delivery of tickets they kept saying the tickets will be in in two weeks they said not to worry about it

2045427 the simple application process can be completed over the phone during the sales call or at the homeowners convenience contractors and their customers have been asking for such a program and as a leading provider of retail credit services to consumers ge money was a clear choice to provide fast no hassle financing

2045431 the administrations proposal says these deals should only be permitted when the acquiring entity has a higher credit rating than the seller
2045432 such a transaction creates greater security for retirees and the pension system
2045433 we have identified several clients who would be willing to be first to sell a plan
2045434 but the question is when is a good time for this
2045435 if we had stuck to our original opening date i think we would have opened that center probably around 70 percent maybe 75 percent occupied
2045436 i think by delaying it this project will open 90 percent to 92 percent or 93 percent
2045437 weve had these discussions with the retailers who almost universally said they would prefer to open in 2010 versus 2009 so thats really what we took our cue from the extra time i think is a prudent thing to do not only for us but for the retailers the end result is that we will just have much much stronger openings
2045438 while we cant be certain that such construction financing will in fact be available in one year we believe that these projects will be highly desirable financing candidates
2045439 historically more than 50 percent equity and more than 50 percent preleased would satisfy even the most stringent construction loan underwriting
2045440 this project will be a great project anchored by nordstrom macys dillards crate amp barrel all those deals are totally firm
2045441 there are in fact some people who project that the current economic conditions and the severely constrained and limited supply of commercial mortgage financing will never improve
2045442 our initial inclination is not to attempt to console inconsolable people
2045443 however the main reason that we will be able to get through the time that it will take to heal the damaged financial markets is that the substantial majority of our debt maturities are existing mortgages on high quality malls with stable and predictable cash flow
2045444 the average expiring loan to value levels are low even when you use the lower leverage standards for loans that can be still be obtained in the current difficult environment

2045448 people asked me why i took this fight i wanted calzaghe but we couldnt get him then somebody mentioned bernard hopkins we train the same for each fight it will be a pleasure to be in the same ring with him
2045449 there is no one else to fight calzaghe wont fight so this is the only fight i had he cant make 160 so we are fighting at 170 im 62

2045457 the reality is either way you might see something like that
2045458 but if youre asking me is it possible in this day and age that you could have a ticket like that i think so
2045459 obama is bad for this country he is being forced down our throats for some reason
2045460 im a supporter of hillary but now im going to vote for mccain
2045461 if you were a real dem you would fallow the party line
2045462 if obama gets the nomination im going to vote for the candidate who left his first wife after she was disfigured in a car accident who pimped his current wife out to a crowd of bikers and who voted against equal wages for women that makes perfect sense
2045463 regretfully amp humbly take over the presidency after the tragic death of mccain obama
2045464 ohhhhh pick clinton everyone will vote for that ticket hillary wuz robbed
2045465 america needs a uniter america needs obama this world needs barack obama

2045490 it is very rewarding to see that our work with the airline has resulted in the addition of a second daily flight from boston which is a very important market for us to san juan

2045494 im going to get to play in front of my u of h fans and my family i cant wait to get back to texas
2045495 being in the nfl has been my dream since i was little
2045496 so being out here in practice making plays hopefully i can translate it into the preseason game and hopefully into the season
2045497 i have a lot of friends from the football team and from the band coming hopefully i can put on a show and get in the endzone for them
2045498 well see how the recovery is well see how the operation goes and what the doctors say
2045499 its so frustrating because i just missed half of my senior season in college then i come back and im doing well in camp about to play in my first game since october and i injure my elbow and get sidetracked for three months
2045500 its frustrating but at the same time ive got to stay focused stay smart in my mind and dont get mentally broke down i just have to stay positive about the whole situation and make it work
2045501 but its also exciting to play in your first nfl game at a position that you havent done since high school im really excited i know its going to be a good experience and im going to play the fourth quarter as far as i understand it at linebacker too
2045502 we have disciplined targets for growth these investments demonstrate that we are well on our way to delivering them for us its more a case of opportunity bites than credit crunch
2045503 our property acquisitions team is identifying prime sites for development across the uk and ireland as we roll out our expansion plans
2045504 our approach was to basically exploit the cells own internal control mechanisms to guide differentiation of the cell population as a whole
2045505 by manipulating the expression of transcription factors how genetic information is communicated within the cell we were able to understand how to influence to the very essence of the cell fate determination
2045506 we believe that this process provides new tools to explore the pathways of endoderm differentiation

2045514 i dont think america would be penniless as a result of hedging that bet
2045515 it turns out that the quantity that they came to was about 271
2045516 i am very worried that the f 35 will fail a test
2045517 to say now that we want to devolve to a single production line of fifth generation fighters i just think introduces the nation to risk that is unnecessary

2045522 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2045523 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2045524 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2045525 well report vulnerabilities we find in third party software and well work with them to identify resolve and mitigate those vulnerabilities
2045526 thats a hard question were always looking to provide the best experience for our customers so well examine all aspects including vulnerability identification other mitigations and as a final link detection and deployment
2045527 the necessary information and assistance to develop an update to address the vulnerability
2045528 some may question our motives but this is for the good of customers and the enterprise and will help protect their environment of microsoft software and other software as well
2045529 it will raise the level of security and is good for the whole ecosystem

2045533 its a formidable achievement and endorses microsofts decision to appoint us as a third distributor
2045534 i havent spoken to the people who made the decision but i think our win as microsoft distributor of the year was partly due to embracing all areas in the channel i think small independent builders and resellers are being left behind by the big distributors and they too need a personal approach
2045535 when distributors dipped small resellers we said bring it on and come to us we understand that the australian channel is unique in that there are a large number of independent resellers building lots of systems and the need to source applications and components locally was vital
2045536 businesses going under cant all be attributed to changes in the it market
2045537 there is a broader issue in that the overall economy is going through changes altech is trying to also work out a way to relieve resellers of the pressure from delivery fees
2045538 it is ridiculous in the extreme for the sun and the telegraph to get indignant about replica medals when the government itself through the national army museum also sells them to collectors
2045539 the pathetic level of their attack is in fact a good sign because if that is now the way they have to try and attack the bnp then it just goes to show that we have won the political debate
2045540 all they can do now is try and invent half baked smears which have nothing to do with the issues facing britain namely the immigration invasion the collapsing economy the dire state of the nhs and the other things which really sway voters
2045541 selling fake vcs is very disrespectful the honour of the medal and its history shouldnt be tarnished like this

2045549 posted by caligraphy2 considering we now dont have a country worth fighting for and soldiers are treated with contempt by this government and sometimes verbally abused in public this attempt to smear the bnp is pathetic especially as many of us agree with their opinions but then thats the real reason behind this story isnt it
2045550 its almost as if someone put them up to it
2045551 and what have you done to impede the war effort today bloggs
2045552 my guess is that mercer being ex army was set up by the tory spin doctors

2045568 you never want to look back and see that lady died and say i wish i would have done something
2045569 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2045570 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2045571 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2045572 its very different we fell like all our windows basically face to the west so i dont know you kind of feel secluded in a way
2045573 i think theres more traffic now than there was even before the flood with people coming to visit the other people on the road
2045574 they were an ideal group to ask to come and during their park watch patrols then to also patrol these areas what better people to have theyre trained and ready to go
2045575 this is citizens helping citizens without the volunteer park watch people stepping up to doing this i dont know if we could gather 35 people up that are willing to take the shifts that these people are willing to take and they could be here anytime of the day or night
2045576 hopefully it will help certainly something needs to be done i mean as far as these houses might be abandoned but theyre still peoples houses

2045580 mrs seemann voluntarily gave her neighbor the dirt so he could level out his lot
2045581 its a way for halifax and bank of scotland to get more people to take out one of their mortgages
2045582 if the maximum you can save is 5 000 then even if its doubled it will still only amount to 10 000
2045583 and that will mean the borrower is likely to be forced onto an expensive high loan to value mortgage at over 90

2045641 it was the best experience of my life thus far
2045642 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2045643 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2045644 its an extremely powerful experience im just extremely proud to be canadian today

2045647 im writing a new version of the invisible man for universal
2045648 im in the process of doing invisible man right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script im actually working with one of the artists from batman begins and the dark knight so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
2045649 well the invisible man the universal film is a great movie a claude rains film
2045650 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation
2045651 it involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now
2045652 it kind of crosses a lot of genres its very steam punk
2045653 i dont want to give too much away but i took what being invisible could mean to the next logical extreme
2045654 we do a lot of crazy things in it that are sort of far beyond what anyones done with it yet
2045655 all that oil bubbling up makes it slick very slick
2045656 we are so happy that god protected us we are rejoicing here with the lord but pray for our bodies we were beaten quite badly please pray that we would receive healing
2045657 in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes
2045658 let me add one more to old bens list if you vacation at walt disney world at some point during your vacation you will find yourself standing in a line for certain
2045659 these mostly went through focusrite avalon and digi pres and some through the console mostly the instruments were miked in mono sometimes dual mono and sometimes stereo bob was always admonishing me to keep things simple as we had no idea where the mixes and overdubs might happen at that point
2045660 deciding on a tempo and letting it rip we had a lot of experimentation with different combinations and setups i pretty much printed everything and a lot of the rough or guide parts were used in the final they sometimes played to a click sometimes jammed along with a basic groove and loops often tracking three or four guys together
2045661 the guys were so easy to work with because what they do which is kind of different is they build music there its not like they go into the studio and spontaneously do this most of the recordings we know of hardcore indian music is very patterned and structured and focused and our stuff is pretty loose close enough for jazz applies so it was interesting to see them loosen up and be more spontaneous generally the indian mindset is much more serious
2045662 but if you say jimmy cobb heres an indian classical vocalist now what are you going to play one take react bye youre going to get something interesting i think rehearsing kills jazz we were letting them all be musicians not re enacting some historical moment we werent trying to recapture the vibe of the original records in any way no one wanted to do that what would be the point of that
2045663 bob wanted them to respond to something theyd never heard before these guys knew the tunes of course but they were hearing it in a new light i mean all blues on sitar it was a blast
2045664 its all sliding glass doors and huge windows so when the curtains are open its like theyre all in the same room together
2045665 i do a lot of jazz so i need to be able to do drums acoustic grand piano and acoustic bass live
2045666 i had assumed that everyone played on a giant bollywood soundstage with everyone playing together but when i saw the photos i saw that was not the case it wasnt a big room and a lot of it was overdubs we did a lot of that as well other than the two rhythm section days there was a day with mike stern and a couple with wallace and we did some by isdn from other cities
2045667 wallace roney was stunned i got the horn to sound the way it does i said ive worked on all these miles records with great engineers at sony they told me everything it was like graduate school
2045668 bob really wanted that classic dark miles tone a lot was in his playing but eq is a tool too trumpet is a very bright instrument and a lot of that high end especially if you dont want it to sound terribly necessary so we rolled off a bit of that and then added delay and reverb to put him in the mix theres very little compression anywhere on the record i tried not to disturb their dynamics
2045669 reverb is orchestration compression is orchestration stereo imaging is orchestration to some degree i also looked at this as a chance to go into human orchestration i could put in people who played a certain way that i thought could get a certain reaction then i could put another player on top of that and get a reaction and i could then manipulate it all in the digital realm to take teo maceros idea one step further i talked to teo a lot about what i was doing i had a linear conception in mind and from that it was building everything horizontally to create this labyrinth of sound
2045670 the tune jean pierre is ridiculous because i had a drummer play to a click track in mumbai with a flute player and some percussionists and then i took it to the states and i had drummer vince wilburn play to the click track without hearing the other drummer
2045671 this action more clearly demonstrates the importance of higher education to my administration while removing an unnecessary layer of government bureaucracy
2045672 this change also elevates the position of cpe president to one of my top advisers which is critical to developing a more highly educated workforce that is armed with the skills to compete and attract new jobs to our state while also making the dream of a college education more affordable and accessible to all kentuckians
2045673 we applaud gov beshear for taking action to strengthen his involvement with public postsecondary education in the commonwealth
2045674 this organizational structure apparently worked well during gov paul pattons administration and we believe it will do so again
2045675 this organizational change will strengthen the lines of communication between the postsecondary education system and the governors office which is very important to the achievement of postsecondary education reform goals
2045676 to recruit the kind of national educational leader we need as the new cpe president he or she must be a close adviser to the governor of the commonwealth
2045677 it looks terrible there the carriages are derailed and passengers are trapped
2045678 there were many poles on the train and unfortunately apparently at least one of the dead is polish
2045679 there are many injured there are some dead but we do not have precise numbers because our people are rather devoting time to rescue those alive
2045680 distinct link between tropical rainfall extremes and temperature with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods

2045686 i think i was a little worse at some point and then he gave me this chance to equalise
2045687 im put here by my constituents and its to them i owe my allegiance taking the oath to an unelected person is a nonsense
2045688 i swear by almighty god that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth her heirs and successors according to law so help me god
2045689 we need to make the oath something that people are offered rather than required to take
2045690 i wouldnt drop the oath i would make it optional
2045691 the governments policy is that these projects will be carried out as long as agreements on energy can be reached and developers follow them through
2045692 it would be strange governing if a new administration would overturn everything that the former government had done
2045693 these two plants will not be stopped without laws and this government will not stop them with legal measures
2045694 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie

2045696 alternative music events like this provide an excellent platform for sailor jerry to target its core audience while reinforcing its cult status
2045697 i want to get this resolved one way or another even if we have to end up in some kind of court proceeding
2045698 we do believe that we are the owner of the submerged and submersible land because it is tidally influenced and that those lands did not pass with the donation land claims
2045699 from a surveyors examination of this case it appears there are numerous clouds on the states claim to ownership of the clatskanie river in the downtown area
2045700 1 two dlc grants that vested property rights prior to statehood that made no mention or acknowledgement of any type of waterway within their bounds
2045701 2 the clatskanie river shown to be located in a different quarter section than where it currently exists to at least 1873
2045702 4 a state of oregon decree through the columbia county circuit court that awarded property ownership to private individuals that included submerged and submersible lands of the clatskanie river
2045703 5 at least one purchase by the state of oregon highway commission that included submerged and submersible property from a private individual
2045704 to the bank of the river together with all riparian rights of such property in to and along said river along said property and the waters thereof
2045705 my name is john lillich and my wife and i own commercial property within the clatskanie city limits we have a clear title to our property when one buys a clearly defined surveyed property with a clear title the purchaser assumes an expectation of total ownership of ones described land
2045706 recently the dsl has called into question our constitutional right to own part of our private property i will now present to the dsl eight reasons why they have no claim to what is rightfully ours
2045707 4 for 149 years there has been no history of leases being paid to the state for piling structures or docks by private upland owners bordering the clatskanie river within the city limits
2045708 5 the clatskanie river was never meandered no one knows its exact location in 1859
2045709 7 submersed and submersible land has been included in our tax lot descriptions since the inception of county property taxes
2045710 8 some of these aforementioned facts were discussed with the former dsl agent larry potter about 20 years ago he told me he was reviewing my property and that he would send me lease forms for my dock from his office should a lease be required no lease forms were forthcoming
2045711 in conclusion i would like to say that i can produce more reasons why i own my property
2045712 on the issue of navigability under the statute a stream is navigable in fact on that date if it was susceptible of being used in its ordinary condition as a highway of commerce trade and travel in the customary modes of trade and travel on water at the time of statehood feb 14 1859
2045713 in 1859 the clatskanie river or creek would have been a difficult body of water to navigate
2045714 the boundaries of my property are legally defined the footprint of the clatskanie river in 1859 is not the actions of the dsl have clouded my title and cost me a considerable amount of time this situation needs to be cleared up immediately so as not to waste any more valuable and costly time by either party
2045715 i find it troublesome that we seem to deny the importance of territorial land grants
2045716 i learned some things tonight that i didnt know i want to go back to the office look through our notes the written materials you provided photographs and other things i understand the angst that this causes folks well take another look and come back to everyone with a plan of action

2045721 the difference in price isnt massive and the fact that there are three operators once you have coverage of course means there is choice
2045722 you can see the potential for mobile to plug the gap in coverage where there are no other providers
2045723 we are currently reviewing our pricing and should be in a position to make an announcement on this in the very near future
2045724 what youll see is the price staying the same and the capacity going up
2045725 many of those criticisms hold true for dsl and cable as well
2045726 headline speeds are dangerous every technology over promises and under delivers the difference with mobile broadband is the under delivered product isnt bad
2045727 the percentage of mobile only households is continuing to increase and pc and laptop ownership is also continuing to grow strongly both of these trends indicate that there is an opportunity for growth in the mobile broadband market

2045747 they havent been repaired in years and the city is not doing anything about it
2045748 i guess the best isnt good enough at this point
2045749 anyone who is starting up a distribution company or any other company for that matter will know what its like to get things going and constantly have issues that threaten the survival of the business my vision of being a distributor with bite was being seriously undermined by a lack of appropriate it infrastructure
2045750 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
2045751 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to
2045752 we have been using onlinedesktop for some time now and its as reliable as our electricity supply it is always there and its always on we just take it for granted
2045753 i need things done correctly the first time and i want them done with minimal fuss and to high standards of excellence my customers are like that too they do not want to hang around and also want their needs to be fulfilled pretty quickly thats why i think i found a real winner with intercept i can work with them knowing that winning is their passion too

2045759 i swam at least one mile three times a week

2045761 swimming a mile with in 35 minutes was a requirement
2045762 my children drew pictures and wrote notes for me to read on the flight on the way and my wife was very supportive

2045764 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2045765 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2045766 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2045767 im 100 positive i mean i was even scared to report it and another person told me i should report it because it was a big deal i just wanted to get out of there
2045768 i hope they find the person thats missing and i hope that person is safe and that guy goes to jail

2045791 i will do my best to achieve peace with our neighbors our first priority should be the palestinians but there are some obstacles
2045792 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem to the worst of our enemies
2045793 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
2045794 if a land has a soul then jerusalem is the soul of the land of israel

2045890 the enterprise risk management market is really in its infancy and it is the opportunity to help shape its evolution which has brought me to strategic thought businesses are starting to recognize the need to move from a compliance view of risk management which is merely a cost to the business to a risk reward model risk reward not only mitigates risks to help reduce for example the cost of insurance and credit but also allows a company to actively manage its portfolio of opportunities and go after more business with greater confidence

2045893 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids epidemic
2045894 if black america were a separate country it would elicit major concern and extensive assistance from the u s government
2045895 instead the national response to aids among black americans has been lethargic and often neglectful

2045936 i got out of the first inning and cruised after that i threw a lot of pitches in the first but after we scored a few runs it seemed like they started swinging early in the count and giving up at bats

2045967 we continue to experience growth in all aspects of the business
2045968 the past few quarters were particularly busy as we cultivated our business through internal initiatives and opportunistic acquisitions
2045969 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2045970 this growth requires a total of 3 358 airplanes joining the freighter fleet by 2027 taking into account anticipated airplane retirements of 1 414 airplanes
2045971 widebody freighters will dominate the new production freighter total and 641 will be of the large freighter segment more than 80 tons capacity
2045972 demand for new production equipment is driven by operational efficiency and reliability as well as environmental and regulatory pressures including noise emissions and aging
2045973 consequently there will be an increase in overall average freighter airplane payload
2045974 dedicated freighters will continue to provide an increasing proportion of air cargo capacity going to nearly 54 and the industry will continue to move to larger airplanes
2045975 additionally freighters will continue to comprise about 10 of the world jetliner fleet during the forecast period

2045984 you can sit a cat and dog next to each other
2045985 we have come to understand that potanin has taken control of the company if we find a basis to our claims our rights have been violated we dont rule out legal action
2045986 a triple merger will never happen its of no interest to us we dont see a future for ourselves in the steel business
2045987 not holding any talks with vladimir potanin about a possible merger of uc rusal and norilsk nickel no confidentiality agreement has been discussed or signed between them
2045988 if the state says we need to give it up well give it up
2045989 but uc rusal said the company was in no need of state support and instead needed an expert to look after production which it said was in a
2045990 as of today mmc norilsk nickel is russias largest public diversified mining and metals company whose informational openness transparency and corporate governance standards were repeatedly and highly esteemed by independent experts in russia and abroad
2045991 over the past years the company has become a global manufacturer of nonferrous and precious metals showing stable volumes of manufacture and guaranteed deliveries of production to consumers in this connection the company considers it to be an incorrect statement by uc rusal that the industrial and financial indicators of mmc norilsk nickel have worsened according to the confirmed strategy of technological development russian enterprise norilsk nickel is generating stable volumes of manufacture and counting foreign acquisitions in 2007 the company has increased manufacture of commodity nickel to 276 339 tonnes that exceeds the volume of manufacture of commodity nickel in 2006 by 13 mmc norilsk nickel confirms the 2008 plan of growth in the volume of manufacture of commodity nickel to 300 305 000 tonnes copper to 415 420 000 tonnes palladium manufacture in 2008 is expected at a level of 3 to 3 5 million ounces and platinum 710 720 000 ounces
2045992 in april and may of 2008 mr m prokhorov failed to fulfill his obligations to mr v potanin to close a number of transactions in relation to shares of norilsk nickel and polyus gold in this context mr v potanin and interros are currently neither preparing nor performing any transactions with him we consider public announcements made by the onexim group to be misleading to the market they are aimed at manipulating the share price therefore interros as a shareholder of norilsk nickel has proposed that the company makes a request to the regulatory authorities in order to obtain a formal evaluation of mr m prokhorovs actions in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of norilsk nickel we regard rusals statements in relation to norilsk nickel and interros as unacceptable for a shareholder of a public company rusal which has yet to sign a confidentiality agreement that was sent to it a few months ago by norilsk nickel has now resorted to the tactic of publicly discrediting the company such actions lead to an erosion in value of norilsk nickel and ultimately harm its shareholders
2045993 uc rusal is unhappy with its 25 investment into norilsk nickel which cost them in the region of 12 4bn in late 2007 with over half of the acquisition underwritten by debt
2045994 norilsk nickel is a hold at current level our conclusion is that interros needs to present a strategy to minorities
2045995 rusal is abandoning its attempt to merge with norilsk if it is indeed pursuing a sale of its share back to interros through onexim we believe such a scenario is plausible with prospects for a mega merger to produce a national metals champion seeming increasingly precarious we believe deripaska may see a scenario where potanin is pressured to buy shares at a premium as a convenient way out of his investment in norilsk

2046001 the challenges for our athletes in the weeks ahead cannot be underestimated but i know they will rise to meet them i want to wish all the athletes the very best of luck in beijing as our sporting ambassadors they will represent our country with pride and honour
2046002 learning to deal with frustration anger and things of that nature its like helping me to improve myself as a better person
2046003 he has great goals and aspirations and he knows he can go and get that great future
2046004 if we can put more resources into these prevention activities then we will reap the benefits on the other side
2046005 we want to track their progress so from the schools we need grades attendance records and behavior progress
2046006 we think we can overcome that by having parents sign a waiver or release form that will allow the schools to provide us that information
2046007 the children are out there looking for opportunities to improve their lives many know of the risk factors at work so the real goal is to bridge the gap of relevancy thats what it is
2046008 i will never ever do a film with aamir khan
2046009 the original japanese version of neverland card battles was extremely well received and caught our attention as the best trading card game out there
2046010 we have enhanced and optimized ncb for the portable experience and will offer one of the finest card strategy games ever created for the psp this fall
2046011 we are honored to have a strong relationship with yukes company of america and serve as exclusive north american distributor of neverland card battles
2046012 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration
2046013 if it is met or is perceived to be met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2046014 the day before yesterday i was going to their house and i was talking to them for a while
2046015 he was always arguing with her and she would tell him to calm down
2046016 your local church would spend around 1600 2000 to send you here to brazil
2046017 for ten percent of that you would be able to sponsor one or two students for the entire trip and help them multiply disciples here in brazil and that can happen all around the world wed be more than doubling the number of people who would be sharing christ on these missions trips
2046018 they have the same calling we do to get the message out and they are much more capable in many ways within their own culture to reach their own people
2046019 the basis of our pepe youth ministry is youth ministry does not exist for the youth but it exists for god
2046020 we say that whoever can hide behind the cross of jesus and never be seen is the winner
2046021 success for each of our trips is usually defined did we worship god with all of our heart in every place we believe that evangelism is simply extravagantly worshipping in front of unsaved people
2046022 there is potential for brazil to be one of the greatest sending countries seen in the history of missions
2046023 raise a little bit more money for your next missions trip and partner with nationals
2046024 this partnership can be with students that will serve with you on the same field or even can be done in another part of the world by having simultaneous prayer meetings exchange of videos and possibly exchange of students to stimulate a global vision even though we wont be in the same place at the same time we can partner
2046025 this might initiate other actions in neighboring countries so we can continue doing this in a coordinated fashion throughout the european union
2046026 that would be a good way to fight these crimes
2046027 we want to continue to grow i an ready for that change how do you want us to grow
2046028 the city needs to do everything it needs to do to encourage development not discourage it
2046029 i want to run because i want to bring a collective voice to the council
2046030 if we had an extended thing it would be a problem
2046031 they can always add our introductory high speed data service to move them out of the dial up internet world
2046032 at face value for single product customers and double the value for double product households
2046033 given this was a limited deployment the budgeted dollars and impact on capacity is minimal
2046034 that is just god and country day and promoting that event
2046035 thats one of the discounts for that sunday for people that do attend church
2046036 it is unfortunate that wilson county has decided to specifically endorse and promote christianity through this program and discriminate against its non christian citizens i was disappointed when the fair office stated they did not see this as discrimination
2046037 he said if you have a deep desire to change your neighborhood dont just sit there
2046038 so ive taken it upon myself and i am starting a petition
2046039 my family and friends have been affected by the drug dealing
2046040 but what pushed me over the edge was going by there to go to church i rode past and saw crackheads passed out on the steps in front of the place or i see the dancers that are there standing outside in skimpy clothes
2046041 i dont tolerate drugs or anybody starting trouble around here
2046042 we never had any major problems here ive owned this bar for more than 30 years i keep anybody away from the bar causing trouble i shoo them away even when too many people congregate outside
2046043 we dont tolerate trouble we throw anybody out that is unruly and we do nothing illegal
2046044 and theyll ask why is that woman standing outside in her underwear
2046045 and some of them had missing teeth the entire place was nasty it felt dirty to me the whole environment was just nasty
2046046 there are drugs and bad things going on everywhere else
2046047 theres even drugs at the church but i keep this place clean ask the police miller and her supporters seem to be fishing for trouble
2046048 god is a big part of my life and i know you can accomplish anything with him on your side
2046049 i do feel like i have god on my side god doesnt like sin and look what is happening down there
2046050 our kids can grow up and be proud to say they are from
2046051 that pride should resonate through every neighborhood in every corner of the city limits even down to the southeast side
2046052 god said when two or more are gathered he is in the midst
2046053 i already have seven gathered and i plan to get more i think there are a lot of nicole millers in this world
2046054 there is good news about a murder involving daniel perez
2046055 the person who leads co ordinates and controls the execution of state policy on protection of citizens rights and freedoms on national security and public order
2046056 california employers can more freely recruit employees that have signed non compete agreements without worrying about getting sued
2046057 now the california supreme court has said you guys got it wrong
2046058 if the legislature intended the statute to apply only to restraints that were unreasonable or overbroad it could have included language to that effect
2046059 it takes away any opportunity to forum shop and get into federal court if there is federal court jurisdiction
2046060 i read that scolari is more experienced than me what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2046061 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2046062 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2046063 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2046064 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2046065 in people like anderson nani and carlos tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2046066 broadband growth pushed europe ahead of north america in terms of home network adoption
2046067 with the network in place providers will tie in high demand entertainment services
2046068 i have had a good break and am now ready to get back into the saddle and start riding again we finished the first half of the season with good rewards from our efforts and i am sure we can continue that momentum at brno i got a good result there last year after a hard battle with loris and the suzuki gsv r was on the podium as well with john on board so it all looks good for a strong performance from the whole garage we also have a test after the race when we have a new bike featuring chassis and engine developments we have a lot of confidence and high hopes for the changes and im looking forward to see how all our thoughts and ideas will translate on the track but the main thing is the race and i am fully focused on keeping my podium run going
2046069 les facteurs les plus importants dans ce resserrement net restent li s la d gradation des perspectives conomiques
2046070 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken no hyphens one first name one middle name one last name wow 8 08 08 08 08 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy mama jaymes is doing quite well also
2046071 vaughans tearful press conference performance illustrates once again the grip that the cult of self has in this country poor me it didnt work out quite as i planned watch me as i give in to a wave of incoherent emotions
2046072 thousands of miles away young men and women paid a pittance are fighting the taliban in the hell hole which is helmand many have died and the fear is that more will those on the front line have something worth crying about but generally dont
2046073 now that vaughan has some time on his hands perhaps he could be flown out to see our troops in action he might gain a little perspective
2046074 it must make it harder in a way for him because he knows he hasnt been rejected i knew i hadnt lost the dressing room and its the same for vaughan
2046075 there is a feeling that vaughan had lost the dressing room or at least parts of it players no longer responded to him as they once had and in the past year england have beaten only a poor new zealand team at test level
2046076 today guys ive decided to stand down as england captain
2046077 today guys michael vaughan has decided to stand down as england captain
2046078 this weekend was a bit like the old nicky d even though the ryder cup is a tall order i feel that i can still rescue something from the season
2046079 headlines at one bush expresses concern to beijing over human rights new sighting of madeleine mccann in the netherlands and in sport its a bold new era for england as harmison earns oval call up
2046080 at one stage we were good mates although i havent spoken to him for a year or so
2046081 im not sure why the friendship has waned a little bit
2046082 hes got to the stage where hes not batting hes just staying there i wouldnt call that batting hes got to score some runs
2046083 dustin diamond will lay bare the behind the scenes secrets from his years as screech on
2046084 sexual escapades among cast members drug use and hardcore partying
2046085 yesterday i went on a well known online encyclopedia and ive found out that you can write entries for it yourself so from now on ill be suspicious about the information on there
2046086 our guest at tea will be charlotte edwards the england ladies captain shes always a pleasure to have in the box
2046087 it means that your mother and father taught you right and you did what you were supposed to do
2046088 what you did was right and appreciated by people in the community
2046089 the people who have received it have made such outstanding contributions to the sport
2046090 you like to be able to make a positive impact on history and this certainly falls into that category
2046091 i think its like sesame street that old song that says three of these things belong together and one of them is not the same
2046092 i dont know i got the list with the other three guys to me its a huge honor its a very important award its certainly something i dreamed of winning
2046093 any award you receive is a great honor especially something that involves usa hockey
2046094 when you start your journey as a young kid you are playing because you love the game and have a passion for the game when usa hockey gave me a chance to play on a national team before i got drafted in 1982 youre thinking this is a big chance but youre never thinking of setting out to get awards and be honored being able to receive these awards is something that is a privilege to me
2046095 when i worked for gary bettman at the league from 1993 98 i started going to the luncheon every year and seeing the guys that won it and how special it was to them and the pride they received when they won it
2046096 i knew it was a big deal but i hadnt fully appreciated it until i saw the guys that i knew personally win it
2046097 when usa hockey gave me a chance to play on a national team before i got drafted in 1982 youre thinking this is a big chance but youre never thinking of setting out to get awards and be honored being able to receive these awards is something that is a privilege to me
2046098 the impossible came true and when i receive this ill receive it on behalf of all of the folks who made it possible
2046099 that would be all the hockey fans in minnesota and everybody who helped take cinderella to the ball
2046100 by the second or third year marty and i were having dinner in port huron and we were talking about how we thought there would be a heck of a lot of good hockey players coming out of the u s
2046101 we were talking michigan at the time because thats what we knew but it has proven true
2046102 coming to lords is always special walking out to bat through the long room its a privilege just to play here but today has been amazing
2046103 it was an emotional moment when i got my hundred i just jumped for joy and looked up at the dressing room to see all my team mates clapping me they looked thrilled when i walked into the changing room afterwards there was a big applause
2046104 my family were here too which made it even more special
2046105 i did not bat that well in the first game at canterbury and thought i might not get selected for the third game if i did not play well today
2046106 i backed myself and thought i would rather fail giving it a go than making another sluggish 30 luckily it came off but i need to carry on with that approach
2046107 we want justice and closure were just hoping that this reopens it to peoples minds so that any guilty parties might feel a little more guilty and come forward because you can only deal with things like that so long in your mind before it gets to you and thats what were here about and thats what were hoping to gain
2046108 one of the demands of the activists was to form an empower commission the government has decided to form the commission we have asked the state government to arrange for the office of the commission and as soon as that is done the commission will start working
2046109 secondly there was an allegation that the dow chemicals has registered four insecticides with the agricultural ministry the ministry has taken note of it and called for a central bureau of investigations cbi inquiry into it
2046110 the empowered commission which has been accepted by the united progressive alliance upa government should not be one of those commissions set up by the government finally forgotten and this commission will have to address the demands raised by the victims of the bhopal gas tragedy if the commission does not work and do justice for the victims of tragedy then my party communist party of india will take up the issue once again in the parliament and we will fight the government
2046111 technologies and policies to consider for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2046112 were driving green into every aspect of our global business
2046113 this includes setting new standards for energy efficiency and green power delivering environmental and cost savings for customers and aligning key growth priorities with our focus on preserving our shared earth every company can join dell and the regeneration in this long term commitment
2046114 dells success in meeting its carbon neutral goal in less than a year is impressive and should serve as a model for other u s companies to follow
2046115 the companys commitment to boost the energy efficiency of its operations and its green power purchases before focusing on carbon offsets is the right approach for achieving carbon neutrality
2046116 i thought he had a chance to compete to be the starting running back hes one of the most gifted running backs ive been around for a long time he is very similar to terrell davis when he came in obviously he has a setback that he has to deal with
2046117 i am going to worry about the future and getting better on the field and in the community and show my teammates that i am here every day no matter what is going on
2046118 im just going to do what i am supposed to do whether it is off the field or on the field and get past this
2046119 one thing about our organization our team is that they make it easy for me to come out here and not have the weight of the world on my shoulders
2046120 he understands what it means to be a leader as an athlete and be a leader in the community and help kids he wants to do those types of things hes a guy that has a big upside not only on the field but off the field hes a natural leader he is going to show people in the community that this isnt talk this is something that he is going to prove to not only denver but the county that hes not only a great football player but hes a quality person
2046121 you cant do anything about the past but you can do something about the future
2046122 i like the way he has handled himself both on and off the football field and thats what he has to concentrate on
2046123 any time you lose a guy like brandon for a couple games it is going to hurt
2046124 he does some things on the football field that not many people can do he opens up some big windows for me and he is an easy target i have a lot of confidence in d jack eddie royal and our tight ends we dont make the decision so we are going to have to move on and make it happen without him
2046125 all i can do is come out here every day and try and be the best player i can be
2046126 my job right now is to be a leader in this team and get the guys out there better i believe in our system and i believe in what we are doing around here i expect those other young guy receivers to go out there and have no drop off at the receiver position
2046127 i think that quarterbacks coach jeremy bates is doing a great job for us with calling some plays and working with me at the quarterback position
2046128 our receivers are playing well and our offensive line is doing a great job i couldnt be more pleased with the way they are playing right now our tight ends and running backs are doing well
2046129 narsistin karisman h ik isem n kertojan tilinteko oudosta ajasta ja yhteiskunnasta

2046131 however in the past and at all times crenshaw has fully cooperated with the attorney general regarding any questions or requests for information they had regarding crenshaws business operations at no time did the attorney general indicate that it was in any way unsatisfied with crenshaws response and cooperation
2046132 the states enforcement action also accuses anderson crenshaw amp associates of threatening to garnish consumers wages or file liens against homesteads in violation of the texas debt collection act according to several complaints the defendants representatives harassed abused and threatened debtors during profanity laden repeated or continuous telephone calls
2046133 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
2046134 the opportunity to showcase our talents in front of a global audience of potentially billions would be just fantastic
2046135 it would help us popularise the game in ireland and build on our success in the world cup last year
2046136 weve just qualified for the world twenty20 in england next year and i know how much both the players and fans enjoy the format
2046137 i really do think its the future in terms of getting new fans on board
2046138 its every sportsmans ambition to participate in the olympics and the chance to play in front of packed stadiums with a worldwide audience would be a great experience for everyone
2046139 gang violence has increased so it is somewhat alarming when you know that the juvenile enforcement team who is tasked with the chore of hunting and tracking these gang members is running with smaller numbers
2046140 i do know certain players and certain officers are being moved and shuffled around among the certain command staff to help offset some of the violence thats out there
2046141 if you ever ask me whats life like in corpus christi is there anything to be afraid of id be very scared of the unlawlessness of the gang activity thats going on here
2046142 i think the sheriff is very much on point with his topics and to a point i applaud the sheriff for being man enough to come out and speak to the facts and not be political about it and say this is the status of the world we live in
2046143 we need to look at it address it and deal with it and thats what im asking the chief to do
2046144 considering the exponential increases in energy costs the new utility allowance regulation will allow builders to more accurately calculate the energy usage for their buildings therefore reducing long term operating costs
2046145 she was demanding that attention be given to her immediately
2046146 victoria osteen never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
2046147 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown
2046148 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency that had an effect on sharon
2046149 she brown did her job with honesty with respect and with professional courtesy
2046150 she continues to suffer from depression and post traumatic stress disorder
2046151 the majority of the industrial design is around air flow because heat is the biggest problem we face
2046152 were trying to help with all those silly service calls that arent the dealers fault
2046153 i was absolutely thrilled to see angelina jolie wearing our
2046154 the cigarette companies have told us for years that smoking is an individual choice
2046155 but it is increasingly clear that for some people that isnt really the case
2046156 people with this genetic makeup find smoking pleasurable from that first cigarette and they are more likely to get addicted and develop lung cancer
2046157 in fact during initial exposure many people get sick but while we understand quite a bit about how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after dependence is established we know very little about this initial vulnerability
2046158 if humans have naturally occurring differences in the dopamine system in this area of the brain that might be one reason why some people would find their initial exposure to cigarettes rewarding and others would get sick
2046159 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2046160 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2046161 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2046162 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2046163 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2046164 they came in and saw me working out and they asked to see some film
2046165 i came down for a trip and i liked it
2046166 my brother told me my true freshman year to try and get on the special teams and be ready to knock the mess out of anybody you see thats what he did at toledo
2046167 my other brother told me to work hard and my dad said to do whatever it takes
2046168 he said to just stick in there because you are going to see a lot of things you are going to see a lot of freakish athletes and stuff like that i have seen that here and i have just adjusted to it
2046169 he told me that i should take my chances here because he got a great opportunity at ohio state and there is nothing like being at a big university
2046170 he knew west virginia was big and he thought i should take the opportunity to come here
2046171 a lot of head coaches we played cleveland st edwards and their coaches told their players that they had to knock me out so they blitzed on every play
2046172 it was a little different playing offense and i miss it but id rather knock somebody out
2046173 coaches say we dont have a set depth chart and ive been working with the twos and getting in with the ones a few times and taking all of the three reps
2046174 watching reed when hes in its a lot different and the environment changes because reed knows the defense like the back of his hand
2046175 sometimes when i come off the field i dont even go to coach casteel i just go to reed and check with him that helps me out him watching me
2046176 and j t thomas and ovid goulbourne are our two fastest linebackers and they can move
2046177 they know what theyre doing and they know how to use what we do in our defense to their advantage they know how to fit into certain creases and they can just fly
2046178 j t thomas who is a starter at right tackle wouldnt come off that team for anything the best 11 will be on the punt team and the second best 11 will be on the kickoff team
2046179 every guys dream is to go out there and play in front of that crowd and if i get the chance im definitely going to take it
2046180 i like to design and draw and i can draw well
2046181 ever since i was little i did stuff like that actually its cars i like to draw and design cars i like the mechanics i like to change tires work on radiators and engines
2046182 gizmo is a relatively young company and the capability of inspirationcompact to expand and adapt to our growth surpassed all our expectations the solution let us pinpoint the areas needed for agent training and even helped managers outside of our contact center identify areas they could improve
2046183 when they were told to get on the floor it appears scarbourough refused to do so
2046184 the armed gunman then shot the victim in the shoulder
2046185 everybody tried to knock off the surf lifestyle at all distribution channels from costco to kohls to jc penney
2046186 generally speaking most were not successful why they didnt have the consumer the kids didnt shop in there it wasnt cool and they didnt have any of the brands whats changed is that along comes hollister and it does vertical surf better than most surf companies to the average consumer thats not a core kid from a product and price perspective and as an environment to shop it has become a brand unto itself
2046187 inspired by the sun drenched spirit of california and the surf and soul of the pacific ocean hollister is a laid back aspirational lifestyle destination
2046188 first they dreamed up this west coast lifestyle concept explains mitch kummetz senior retail analyst at robert baird
2046189 if you go back to 2000 surf was pretty strong and these guys wanted to play in that market so they just dreamed up this business out of thin air as far as a mall store goes and who their customer is which is the aspirational consumer they couldnt do a better job building stores that appeal to that consumer if you compare them to a pacsun a lot of it is contrived and pretentious to someone who is of the industry and participates in the sports but to somebody who is in the mainstream and is aspirational their stores are going to look more like the real deal than a pacsun or a zumiez or a core shop for that matter zumiez would never do that because thats not who their customer is their customers would see through that in a heartbeat but if youre just some mainstream kid living in ohio or wherever this seems as authentic as anything
2046190 i heard people outside the store asking if it was a restaurant
2046191 when you can sit in michigan and look at the north and south side of huntington beach pier to check the surf theyre basically connecting the dots to convey that they are pretty authentic
2046192 they do a really good job on color merchandising and price points
2046193 so the only thing they really dont have is the real authenticity but they do a really good job of convincing people that dont know any better that they are the shit
2046194 the concept has only been around for seven or eight years but they dont just roll out a concept called hollister they dream up this whole history behind it they have shirts with a graphic that has something about a surf contest in san onofre in 1962 or something they make stuff up because their customer buys into it they do a phenomenal job developing merchandise around the imagery of the stores and the history that theyve basically invented
2046195 to me its the most amazing record that exists in u s retailing period
2046196 there are typically two measures that we look at in terms of retail performance
2046197 one is productivity which is just another way of saying sales per square foot they hollister did 531 dollars a foot last year that was actually a little bit down from the year before but anything over 500 dollars a foot is pretty darned successful
2046198 the second thing is comparable store sales performance last year they were actually down a little bit with a negative two comp for the year i think thats the function of a few things were looking at a pretty difficult retail environment in general so were not seeing a lot of the teen retailers comp positively
2046199 i think as they open up stores and kind of back fill existing markets some of the new stores cannibalize the business at existing stores which also brings down their comp performance once youre at a level where youre doing over 500 dollars per square foot its pretty hard to continue to generate same store sales increases because youre already so successful the way some retailers try to do it is to try and tweak the mix that theyre selling and they focus more on accessories because accessories tend to be a more productive category in terms of being able to jam a lot of goods into a small amount of real estate abercrombie is doing a little bit if that with hollister on the fragrance side but i dont think thats enough to really move the needle
2046200 the scary thing about hollister is that they were at 450 stores last year and theyre talking about expanding to 1 200 stores
2046201 they already have three stores in canada and theyre going to have four stores in the uk by the end of this year that 1 200 store count will probably consist of 700 to 800 stores in the u s which would mean 400 500 stores globally considering that as a chain with 450 stores they did 1 6 billion in sales last year seven to ten years down the road it could be a five billion dollar business globally thats not all incremental business thats sales that are being pulled from somewhere
2046202 we are benefiting from international tourists traveling to the u s to take advantage of a weak u s dollar we were able to realize this benefit because of our global brand recognition
2046203 this is additional proof that there is global demand for our brand and it gives us further confidence that we can be successful with our international expansion initiatives it also demonstrates the importance of owning a global brand during a difficult selling environment in the united states
2046204 a memorable and unique experience to customers as well as an important step for the brand
2046205 i think hollister is a threat to other mall based retailers
2046206 its a major threat to pacsun and to a lesser degree to zumiez if you look at pacsun everything they are doing as a company from a strategic standpoint is to try to steal market share away from hollister
2046207 its funny you would think that pacsun is the more legitimate action sports retailer in the mall and yet they are doing things to change their business to make it look more like hollister because hollister is the mall based retailer that the average mainstream consumer would think is the more legitimate store
2046208 hollister is competing on fashion and price and pacsun is trying to compete against them
2046209 it is tough for me to speak to the strategy of pacsun in the context of an article on another brand or competitor
2046210 our efforts have been focused on four key objectives growing our juniors business reconnecting with our customer improving our customer shopping experience and investing in the company to improve operating efficiencies each of these objectives supports our overarching goal of achieving results through improved store productivity to put this in perspective we achieved sales per square foot of approximately 350 dollars in 2007 this level of productivity is significantly below our competitive peer set that on average exceeds sales of 500 per square foot
2046211 i think the environment that pacsun needed to upgrade was really manifested by the success of hollister
2046212 i know they pacsun were compared to them hollister a lot because they were luring the kid away and their whole store is private label and yet pacsun had all these brands unfortunately the brands got swashed by a lot of the private label that pacsun did so they hollister have helped influence a lot of the market both big and small and i dont think theres a retailer out there that isnt really aware of them
2046213 the reality is that they hollister have the infrastructure the muscle and the financial backing to look at it on a global level
2046214 i think their stores look really good inside theyre well merchandized and they make good product theyre a good competitor theres no way to get around that
2046215 i dont think hollister is a threat to the core guy
2046216 if youre jacks or hss or active then your customer for the most part is a participant in the sport or at least a little bit more hard core kid and that kid probably isnt shopping at hollister
2046217 being a core retailer the thought of hollister gives us a laugh it doesnt affect my sales as my customers tend not to be mall shoppers
2046218 i realize that billabong and quiksilver opened vertical stores as well as dc burton and others in order to compete against the hollisters of the world they didnt do it to compete with core retailers but this is a byproduct of that move
2046219 they are exploiting what weve built and our lifestyles and are forcing legit surf manufactures to open company stores in malls throughout the u s to compete for the dollars they are sucking away from our industry
2046220 while the rest of us are bickering and arguing about which vendors are opening company stores and which vendors are selling on line direct or if a vendor is opening another retailer close to them hollister is not so quietly taking a huge part of our market
2046221 dont get me wrong im not saying that the hollisters of the world give the legit surf manufactures the right to open company stores at will but in an area where there arent quality surf skate or snow specialty retailers and hollister is getting a lions share of our pie then im all for it
2046222 we need to stand behind the surf business and sport and keep supporting the brands because these guys hollister are jumping in and are having a free ride on our back
2046223 we are really trying to keep our shops a notch higher than mall stores so that we can keep up with them we are spending so much money to open our shops because we are the ones representing the surf market to the outside world and if we dont keep up with everyone then the surf market will be hurt
2046224 hollister in my opinion has some of the worst customer service customer service will set us apart long gone should be the time of vibey shop kids at our front counters or doors long gone are the times when parents or insecure kids would feel uncomfortable coming into our stores this is the new day and age of specialty retail
2046225 the reason that most of our retailer partners got into this business wasnt to make a buck it was because they loved it and they wanted to have a surf shop
2046226 at the end of the day that passion is something the hollisters of the world dont understand i think the people that really improve the service and really tell the story in the store for the brands will clearly be successful
2046227 when you go into the heartland and really see the hollisters you realize that we need some surfsides and some jacks and some sun diegos out in the midwest to tell the real story there are a couple of guys out there that are really good but theres not enough of them
2046228 i wish we had more quiksilver stores out in the midwest if we had a few more out there itd be great to help tell the story
2046229 this is hard to believe because hes always such a good man
2046230 hes always done what he can to help everyone in the program
2046231 we had a hard fought battle and it came down to the two top teams
2046232 in the end and i think we just out veteraned them we have more than enough talent in the dressing room to go around and any second we want to turn it on we just push the button
2046233 it is always better to win the game in the end but i think it was an accomplishment to get there
2046234 everybody in the league i think got something out of it because we got to play a reasonable level of hockey for this time of year and most of these guys are going off to camps we hope that this helped them
2046235 los problemas m s graves se observan a largo plazo
2046236 now im the minister i need to have responsibility for the advancement of sport in northern ireland per se
2046237 thats football thats rugby and its gaelic and the other sports but those three main sports were the sports which were going to avail of any new stadium
2046238 i havent yet come to a conclusion but im going to in the next few weeks and im then going to make an announcement in the assembly in the autumn
2046239 my generation doesnt care about race or sexual orientation will you baby boomers die out already so we get about running the country
2046240 the law will be scrupulously enforced to improve the traffic situation
2046241 fines will be fixed to prevent people from committing violations once and for all
2046242 what they find odd is that they are supposed to abide by the law while actual conditions make it impossible
2046243 there should have been a transitional period first in which the government dealt with its own violations and it should have provided parking places before asking people not to double park put in working traffic lights before asking people not to jump them erected road signs indicating speed limits repaired streets so that they no longer had holes and bumps had that been done then the traffic law would have commanded respect
2046244 if the government was serious it would have done its job first before asking the people to abide by the law the crux of the matter is that it seems no more than a way to make money
2046245 chaos in the streets is a repercussion of the waning authority of the law which is a result of the states own failure to respect the law you cannot re establish order or expect people to respect the law unless it is applied impartially without favour
2046246 i am not the sort of manager who cries i look forward and move on
2046247 i could have waited until august 31 to see what could happen i am not that type of person
2046248 when we were sensing the situation was not going to happen we made our decision and i am very happy to have muntari
2046249 he is a good boy a good player i always like players who previously worked with good managers and he worked with one of the best in english football so he will have learned a lot with harry redknapp
2046250 i prefer to think about sulley than about frank lampard
2046251 recent news stories suggesting the government has put forward a proposal on stamp duty are simply wrong these stories are based on speculation
2046252 as has been said on many previous occasions the government has made clear that there are a number of options we will need to consider to help businesses and people get through what is undoubtedly a difficult time

2046257 many marketers today dont realize or harness the power and reach of the gaming industry as a viable means of targeting consumers en masse
2046258 the gaming industry generates more revenue than cd music sales and movie box office and is responsible for more time spent online than any other entertainment form
2046259 the industry average click rate is currently at 20 whereas intergi realizes click rates averaging 50 through proprietary optimization software with many programs returning click rates as high as 1 5

2046261 this is a golden opportunity it will bring long term benefits
2046262 this car is more than worthy of sitting above the excellent
2046263 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2046264 if you look at the last few races mark won the pole at daytona we were leading the race at barber before our engine failure and we won last week at montreal its finally coming together weve been strong but we got the monkey off our backs with our first win that definitely helped the team now everyones ready to go after it
2046265 losing that way makes us more motivated its been a while since we won a race 2003 at mont tremblant canada but in our hearts weve won several races
2046266 indiscriminate and widespread shelling by the sla at 1 00am last night left a baby dead and 16 people injured shells fell inside the mullaithivu hospital gas residence and doctors quarters and adjacent villages within a 10 kilometre radius shells fell and exploded in the villages of neeravipiddi uduppukulam kumarapuram and thanneeruttu surrounding the mullaithivu hospital
2046267 it has become clearly evident that ltte is visibly loosing grounds in the war fronts and these are the usual tactics they adopt to draw the attention of the international community
2046268 ltte make use of innocent civilians as shields to cover up their losses and lapses this has resulted in a great insult to humanity
2046269 we always take all possible steps to ensure the safety of the civilians the government has taken a policy decision to continue this humanitarian mission until all the innocent tamil civilians are liberated from the ltte till that goal is achieved the government will never go for negotiations or accept the conditions put forward by the terrorists however government would start negotiation with the ltte if they immediately lay down their arms

2046282 any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2046283 chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2046284 today china and the u s are friends not best friends but just friends
2046285 they need to cooperate with one another because they are both two very important countries
2046286 but over the long term it wont really have an impact on u s china relations or even on chinese perceptions of president bush
2046287 first message to the chinese people is i respect the chinese people respect the history tradition and im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman
2046288 his visit to china will draw a relatively perfect conclusion to the china us relationship under his presidency
2046289 but the real success came back in 1998 and 1999 when frank ortiz and other agents involved were able to really shut down the investigation and prevent what would have been a huge economic and environmental disaster for the united states

2046291 speech technology has reached a critical turning point where it is now fundamentally changing the way that we interact with the world around us
2046292 that doesnt include the seven bags i took over to my sisters house
2046293 this is the third time theyve done something like this but this is the worst
2046294 it smells and you start worrying if rats are going to start showing
2046295 its sitting there and now we are paying somebody else to dump it
2046296 she and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife
2046297 a lot of the property owners did a good job of creating a trail behind them in the grassland that was beyond their property and that helped in our efforts plus it helped that the slope was going down in that area
2046298 its really the perfect environment for what the fcc is trying to accomplish
2046299 this is definitely the place where real world conditions exist to the extreme when testing is complete we should have a much clearer view of whether or not this proposed technology can operate without interfering with other necessary services and uses that are ongoing
2046300 the proposed devices will be subjected to receiving tests only
2046301 in terms of wireless microphone activity they will attempt to detect their presence accurately and consistently in different locations throughout the stadium at times before and during the game this is a particularly difficult thing to do when there are other strong signals in the air like those generated by digital television transmission wireless microphones occupy spaces alongside and in between these powerful hd signals
2046302 because if the devices post a series of false positives that stop them from working repeatedly users are going to be strongly motivated to devise ways to defeat that protective circuitry
2046303 we applaud the fcc for taking the initiative to test this proposed technology under the extreme real world conditions this preseason football event will afford this is the best way to reach a level of understanding that will help us all achieve reliable interference protection
2046304 we look forward to watching all of these tests closely
2046305 its imperative that we understand what works and what doesnt before we commit to a situation that cant be reversed
2046306 it was a little bit awkward the way he plays with a big serve and then a lot of drop shots but i wasnt expecting much rhythm tonight
2046307 there are still some things i can do better i wasnt hitting the ball that cleanly at times but all in all it was a good start
2046308 its a little bit frustrating because after the first set i was controlling the match a break up and 0 40
2046309 jay z is ready to have children he and beyonce dated for years now theyre married and for him its time for children
2046310 beyonce is very career focused she has another album due this year and a couple of major film projects in the works
2046311 her career is moving at 90 miles per hour and shes not trying to have it slowed down by a baby
2046312 jay z and beyonce are best friends so its not like theyre fighting over it but they both feel very strongly about their positions if one of them doesnt relent i think it could be a big problem
2046313 i think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself
2046314 when you think about the desperation and the daring of these types of kinds of crimes it speaks to the broader issue of where we are in terms of this economy when people become this desperate than you realize that times are really troubled
2046315 it strikes at the desire of people to be able to go out at night to go restaurants to go to stores so this strikes a very powerful blow

2046327 while we have continued to implement price increases in this segment they have not been adequate to offset the higher input costs an oversupply of turkey breast meat also kept pricing of commodity breast meat at a low level exacerbating the cost price differential

2046334 we appreciated the willingness of the department heads to make a reduction in their budget
2046335 the only place we didnt put the money back was in the commissioners line items
2046336 what people dont realize is that for every department there are many different line items
2046337 there are hundreds of line items we basically had to go through every one of them
2046338 people are filling up their gas tanks and finding that they dont have anything left

2046340 we focused on doing this really fast in the context of an embedded system this was an optimization exercise

2046343 the lightweight static analyzer is fast enough to run unnoticed within bootup and compact enough be used as exploit payload
2046344 if youre not making sure that the compromised code is not in charge at the time you are doing an upgrade the rootkit could intercept the functions to write those new files to remain infected
2046345 i want them to suspect if someone because a particular vulnerability is discovered in the future got into their system then they have to take extra measures to upgrade to make sure what is in there doesnt survive
2046346 we did this research on ios because it makes sense but this work applies to a range of devices

2046354 there was early relief for investors as the royal bank of scotland posted losses of 691 million the second largest deficit ever in the uk but better than the 1 billion plus losses expected in its interim results
2046355 however poor mining stocks and a broker downgrade for vodafone which fell one per cent pulled the blue chip index down in early afternoon trading
2046356 while there may be a feeling that the worst is behind the banking sector any meaningful push upwards by investors will surely need to build on this weeks positivity to finally burst the 5500 barrier and begin challenging levels last seen in june
2046357 doesnt include those who have become discouraged from looking for work or those who have accepted part time jobs when they want to be working full time
2046358 the dollar is a factor but the dominant factor is the perception that high oil prices coupled with slower economic growth in developed countries will curb oil demand

2046364 the chief justices are confident in the integrity and capability of the staff in the registers office to operate effectively and professionally in the absence of mr buonomo
2046365 when he got there the middlesex county probate was broken
2046366 im shocked not more people came here to support him or are outraged by these allegations
2046367 we believe that mr buonomo violated the publics trust by regularly accessing these cash machines without authority and stealing taxpayer money
2046368 we would all like to put a positive face on a negative situation but no it is not getting better it is getting worse
2046369 the coalition leaders believe that it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2046370 this person committed an oppression against pakistan thats why the parliament has decided to impeach him
2046371 the economic policies pursued by general musharraf during the last 8 years have brought pakistan to the brink of critical economic impasse
2046372 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people against the peoples mandate and against pakistan
2046373 democracy is not so weak that this article could be invoked
2046374 there is a desperate need for the leadership of the church to smarten up to gender related issues like violence and issues of power and control
2046375 gender inequality is one of the key drivers of the pandemic the church is in a key position to transform attitudes within the community it cannot remain silent
2046376 gender inequalities leave women disempowered and more vulnerable to violence including rape there are new laws about sexual violence in drc but any law without the collaboration of the community is useless social attitudes which condone violence against women and stigmatise those who have been raped must be confronted
2046377 the church is an influential voice in many affected communities and so is best placed to address these deep rooted attitudes
2046378 it was the church that stood on the front line against slavery and against apartheid now the church must stand up against gender injustice
2046379 we work with churches tackling gender issues and harmful practices which put people at risk of infection we work with both men and women because to effectively address gender inequality we cannot leave men out
2046380 before this women didnt have a say in sexual matters now we have seen relationships restored and communication improved between couples
2046381 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2046382 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2046383 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2046384 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 692m is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2046385 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword and simply because the ceo sir fred goodwin removing him would be too disruptive to the organisation at this time and its just not responsible to do so
2046386 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
2046387 so much of the bad news was already in the public domain and it is not necessarily losses it is non performing assets that are causing these figures and they may come back on in the coming years
2046388 it is difficult to see exactly how exposed it is in many ways banks estimate the worst so it can be better than it appears
2046389 the shareholders are disgruntled but there is no point kicking out the board they got it into this mess so they can get it out
2046390 rbs has a significant equity stake in a number of developers in edinburgh and we know that they are already under pressure from rbs to release some of their capital sell assets and cut costs
2046391 if rbs is making losses and cutting costs then they will want to pass on some of the pain to these firms the second half of the year will be very difficult for a number of people nobody will be buying land schemes will be put on ice and the whole market in the city will be very sluggish
2046392 inevitably there is a fear that if a business comes under increasing pressure it will look to cut its cost base we hope that will not happen here because the royal bank has proven itself to be a front runner
2046393 hopefully in taking the hit this year they will be clearing the way to do well in the future
2046394 we have no fundamental concerns in the scottish economy of course staff like everybody will be concerned about the performance and financial situation
2046395 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2046396 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes
2046397 we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
2046398 we have steered it through good times and we are going to steer it through these times
2046399 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2046400 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2046401 weve had a lot of complaints about prostitution activity along the avenue
2046402 the hookers would go underneath the trees there to perform oral sex and sex acts and leave their drug paraphernalia there
2046403 it affects not only the people involved in it but the people who have to live around it as well
2046404 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2046405 capmex will be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2046406 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2046407 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in the polluted regions of the atmosphere
2046408 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2046409 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming

2046416 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2046424 this is something weve been working toward for several years
2046425 we have been targeting industry sectors that pay above average wages and are growing around the world

2046429 contaminated land is a by product of waless industrial heritage and cleaning up these sites is of importance to the welsh assembly government
2046430 the majority of contaminated sites are dealt with through land development proposals as part of economic regeneration
2046431 however not all contaminated land is subject to planning development and this funding is aimed at dealing with these sites
2046432 its been great everybody i have met has been positive and welcoming clearly the whittemore community is positive and productive
2046433 we toured the new school for the first time monday and its beautiful teachers are clearly anxious to get in there and get their class rooms set up
2046434 ive been working on preparing a correspondence for parents which should go out in several days
2046435 ive been collaborating with jane gatley who is the assistant principal and who has been absolutely fabulous and ive been getting to know my way around the email and the school web site and familiarizing myself with the curriculum
2046436 i love the idea that this is a very diverse community and im drawn to a kindergarten through grade 5 model
2046437 i have had colleagues who have had associations with waltham and ive heard nothing but positive comments on the public school system
2046438 initially im not planning to change anything i want to value the culture as it is and develop a plan to move forward with the staff
2046439 those who are weary of summers bawdy comedies and superheroes
2046440 while elegantly mounted and well acted the movie is not the equal of the tv production in part because so much material had to be compressed into such a shorter time
2046441 if its a choice between the movies 135 minutes or the 659 minutes of the miniseries which has been re mastered and re released in a lavish four disk edition id say its no choice at all the shorter version is the one that seems long
2046442 continued economic uncertainty as well as continued raw material and energy cost pressure
2046443 these aforementioned factors are expected to put downward pressure on earnings primarily in the performance products and solutions segment
2046444 clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination seems to be no more effective than expectant management in couples with unexplained fertility
2046445 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
2046446 the data does not show that theres any difference between the drug and no treatment and iui and no treatment

2046451 without giving away the figures resellers can make around 40 per cent margins on a laptop bag
2046452 nobody carries around a naked laptop any more so there is going to be a sale with every machine that goes out
2046453 removable back up devices need a home and external hard drives are proving incredibly popular
2046454 when i was a pc builder i would have bitten someones hand off if they had offered the sort of markups you can make on a bag a stylish bag is a safe bet
2046455 a case is like a second skin for a laptop it enables them to work on the move but if they drop the system they do not smash it
2046456 a typical salesmans laptop takes a battering so we can offer them protection and extend the life of a machine
2046457 we will take this as far as possible through resellers
2046458 working towards a ceasefire so as to avoid an extension of the conflict
2046459 an immediate end of the armed clashes and direct talks between the parties

2046467 further to media reports chelsea football club can confirm we have made an offer to real madrid today thursday august 7 for the transfer of robinho
2046468 it would be a dream for me to work with scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
2046469 i have always spoken highly of him and he has always spoken highly of me since well before he was at chelsea
2046470 chelsea have made a formal proposal to real madrid for robinho i do not know the amount but the offer has been made
2046471 robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of real madrid have behaved towards him
2046472 he calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and i have to tell him that i have received no calls
2046473 i have spent three days trying to speak with some of the directors at madrid but they have all disappeared
2046474 robinho does not understand anything he wants to be the best player in the world but at real madrid he cannot achieve that because they treat him like a normal player
2046475 he has liked nothing about the way that real madrid have gone about their transfer activity this summer
2046476 real madrid wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo and have not been able to the second option was van der vaart the third one was villa and then in fourth place is robinho
2046477 things cannot be like that because he wants to be the best and he does not have the support at real madrid he is also certain that real madrid is trying to sign david villa
2046478 tomorrow is caylees birthday i wanted to speak with casey and see how shes doing
2046479 all this boils down to is she did not report her missing for 31 days if she had she wouldnt be facing that charge right now
2046480 there are phone call records from that day which are extremely interesting
2046481 the private phone call where casey claims to have spoken with caylee there was no incoming phone call at that time
2046482 casey gave the family information on how to get in touch with several people
2046483 i have on multiple occasions been told by many people that those people exist
2046484 frankly i wouldnt still be here if i didnt think she was cooperating with me and thats the point of all this
2046485 im just here to make a personal visit its got nothing to do with any evidence recovery or any kind of investigative leads
2046486 theres things she thought were important for us to have and we picked those things up and had a nice conversation with her
2046487 some things i was thinking about wanted them to take
2046488 you left your child with someone who doesnt exist at an apartment you cannot identify you lied to your parents it appears you care so little for your child you didnt report her missing until five weeks later
2046489 i tried to stay in shape through the off season
2046490 the lions asked me to come up and gave me a physical
2046491 i thought i was just coming for a physical but they wanted me to stay
2046492 i think it will work out they made a lot of changes that i think will make this team pretty good
2046493 andy signing with them was completely unexpected but his experience is something that will really help them
2046494 i dont know ive said one more year a couple years already

2046500 dark army of steel plated vehicles and armour clad pyromaniacs
2046501 since we at deadline have our roots in movie production we value original stories settings and characters very highly
2046502 the credit crunch and rising costs are fuelling a growth in repossessions which is why we are acting fast to commission these emergency court schemes and help more people stay in their homes
2046503 homelessness has a devastating effect on people and their families yet so many people arrive at court without legal help
2046504 while the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures
2046505 thats why we are expanding free legal representation at county courts which can make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort
2046506 court duty scheme advisers do a fantastic job but the more time an adviser has to prepare the better the chance people have of keeping their homes therefore getting early advice is still the best advice
2046507 if people have housing or money problems they should try and get early advice from a qualified source
2046508 joey has been working very hard on a fitness programme and is just getting his head down which is what he has done ever since i came back to this club
2046509 his training and attitude have been excellent while ive been at this club ive spoken to him and know he has just wants to get back to playing football simple as that
2046510 joey is fine but he wont be featuring in any games until we get him match fit
2046511 theres no way he can regain match fitness between now and the start of the season and theres no way it would be sensible to give him a game at the moment
2046512 this advanced modem is our first umts based product and is one of the dozen new devices we are launching in 2008
2046513 the expresscard expands our product portfolio beyond 3g to wcdma hspa networks and increases our addressable markets hspa technology has a strong momentum right now and we are targeting markets worldwide where wcdma hspa is deployed according to gsa as of july 2008 3g wcdma networks have been rolled out in 94 countries and 35 countries are deploying hsupa networks spread on all continents

2046516 i dont think they noticed anyone else in the club they ordered bottles of mo t amp chandon all night like they were bottles of water
2046517 with no end in sight to the credit crunch and high energy costs the short to medium future looks grim
2046518 the stark reality is that in a core capital intensive industry like ours where you have a rapidly declining customer base and sales together with rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs then jobs go and companies go out of business
2046519 in the past nine months the industry has experienced a drop in business of over 30 together with an increase in production energy costs of 86 with transport costs increasing by 46
2046520 i heard an ambulance and i thought oh i hope he hasnt been hit
2046521 the kid just flew off his bike it was like five or six feet when he flew off his bike
2046522 he hit the kid and made no attempt to stop
2046523 my concern too i was oh i hope the person that hit him is feeling okay too cause accidents happen when i got there they informed me the person hit and run
2046524 i feel better about ourselves that we went after him nobody else probably could have caught up to him
2046525 he remembers now riding home on the bike but he doesnt remember getting hit
2046526 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008

2046544 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2046545 what this means is that almost any vulnerability in the browser is trivially exploitable
2046546 a lot of exploit defenses are rendered useless by browsers aslr and hardware dep are completely useless against these attacks
2046547 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2046548 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

2046553 apart from these 2000 vehicles 250 truck loads of fruit are rotting in sopore
2046554 the fruit is harvested in this season and its shelf life afterwards is very brief the temperatures too are rising alarmingly there is a strong prospect of fruit worth hundreds of crores of rupees getting destroyed
2046555 we will transport our fruit via muzaffarabad to the same markets in india with which we have been dealing in the past
2046556 it is grandioso we have arrived even though weve been here since the beginning of new bedford
2046557 to finally arrive and have an office presence here it is a big deal
2046558 we think its very important as a reference and as a meeting place for the whole community a community meeting place for all of us
2046559 we always regarded new bedfords community to be a very important one and a reference for cape verdean immigration
2046560 if you gave me 100 to go to boston i wouldnt
2046561 the idea in new bedford is to create a meeting place for the community where the different generations of cape verdeans the clubs and the organizations can have a common place

2046563 its extremely exciting to be so close to the known location of the theatre and then find remains that look to be associated with it as well as allowing us to walk in the footsteps of shakespeare himself the remains help us to start uncovering one of londons enduring secrets
2046564 we can now start to work on the detail of what the building here might have looked like and expand our knowledge of the playhouses of elizabethan london
2046565 its a relief because we know what we have we know that we have no major damage under any of the piers or abutments its just some things that need to be touched up and replaced
2046566 our design team worked with the finest artisans to commission items that are inspired by tradition but complement our contemporary lifestyle the result is something distinctive created especially for the peruvian public
2046567 our reproductions sell for more than the real chancay antiques that are sold on the black market
2046568 but its illegal to buy the antiques and tourists cant take them out of the country by buying reproductions like our customers enable todays artisans to earn a living and they help preserve perus cultural patrimony

2046572 trust can be built up over years and be lost in a second
2046573 we do not sell or rent our users data to third parties we clearly recognise the value of the data that we are collecting and with the introduction of new product offerings and the development of intelligent agents we are better able to mine the data to provide content and advertising opportunities that are more relevant and valuable to the users and advertisers respectively this in turn leads to increased monetisation opportunities as we are able to charge more for highly relevant channels and increase conversions

2046578 it was supposed to feel like a bright sixth former going into the teachers staff room
2046579 in other words they did like her and they did respect her and they did know that she was good

2046581 we decided that gene wasnt an overt racist but that he was racially lazy so that he would generalise about people
2046582 id like sam to do all the forensic work in my house because hed be throrough

2046587 its not just about managing vmware enough to get customers to convert to hyper v we are looking at a full management experience for both sets of users
2046588 we recognize that a customer isnt going to have just microsoft hyper v servers or virtual servers they are going to have vmware racks too and if they do vmm will manage it
2046589 obviously since the acquisition of xenserver citrix would be at the top of that
2046590 at this point it is definitely something we want to do when we feel there is enough market adoption of other virtualization technologies
2046591 right now when we talk to customers they either have not adopted mixed environments at all or have done so in small amounts
2046592 vmware currently doesnt have as much to gain by supporting products with small market penetration
2046593 rushing to support these platforms could also be viewed as vmware validating their relevance which is something vmware is in no hurry to do
2046594 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory

2046600 even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years
2046601 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2046602 robinho is very angry about the way he has been treated by the directors of real madrid
2046603 he calls me every day to see if anyone has said anything about his future and i have to tell him no one will speak to me
2046604 ive spent three days trying to contact them and they seem to have disappeared robinho cant understand it he could become the best player in the world but it isnt going to happen at real because they treat him like a second rate player

2046627 our desire to ensure massive infrastructure investment as a platform for further economic development may be undermined by our lack of investment in skills development
2046628 while foreign investors bring about leading skills in design and building of structures much of the supporting skills must be borne by the local population
2046629 investment and merchant banks with expertise and access to funding must be engaged all the time
2046630 reginald development banks must also look to being more proactive in this area and more flexible to long term financial packages that are in the interests of the whole sadc region

2046705 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
2046706 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry

2046710 im not really sure what the main difference was between this game and in sweden i think we just went out and had a lot more fun which i think showed in the way we played
2046711 i knew we didnt play anywhere near to our potential against sweden we discussed that as a club and how it should be a good wake up call to some of the players
2046712 i think the boys had something to prove in this game and show we are a much harder and skilful side than we showed last time we played the swedes

2046727 i like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join a short while later a representative from spurs arrived to discuss my personal terms and contract
2046728 the discussions didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up

2046750 the number of people facing difficulty needs to be kept in perspective
2046751 the good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals
2046752 it is inevitable that more borrowers coping strategies will come under pressure in current conditions than in the unusually benign years of the last decade
2046753 it continued to flame and flame and get bigger and bigger even after we turned it off
2046754 it was just a big ball of flames just shooting the metal chunks were all over the place

2046763 this year were selling more tickets than we ever have to the folks fest
2046764 these are the job losses you do not hear about or see publicised but they all add up it has been well documented that the construction industry is in trouble but tradesmen will always find other employment at home it is not as easy for those in the professions and i fear that we are going to lose a lot of young talented and well educated people to other countries
2046765 but now it has filtered through to the female workforce with job losses across the board we are definitely heading towards a recession
2046766 there are now 11 448 people in limerick on the live register an increase of almost 36 per cent in a year
2046767 a very worrying aspect of these figures is that there are now more than 2 600 under the age of 25 signing the live register in limerick
2046768 we can probably expect to see another rise in these figures in august as the construction industry is still in decline with many losing their jobs i have heard from a number of people in the industry that they will have no jobs to return to after their annual holiday ends this week one person told me how whilst on holiday he was informed his services were no longer required via text

2046771 its one of the things its our passion as pittsburghers and we think that a hotel project is a great way to kick off this development

2046775 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2046776 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2046777 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2046778 we are fully completing the build up of our state today starts a new era of ultimate parting from other identities that our citizens have had
2046779 from this moment on kosovos citizens have their own state identity they are citizens of the republic of kosovo for which we have sacrificed for years
2046780 as far as the government and the serbian interior ministry are concerned we will not recognise the passports of the so called independent state of kosovo we will not allow a single citizen of serbia to cross the administrative line or border crossings with serbia carrying that passport
2046781 for all foreign nationals who have a stamp of the so called state of kosovo that stamp will be invalidated and a stamp of the republic of serbia will be placed on top of it
2046782 bulgaria recognises kosovo passports which is a logical step following its recognition of the kosovar state
2046783 the united states of america officially recognise kosovos passports as valid documents as of august 1 the us government has decided to issue visas for kosovo passport holders so they can travel to the us
2046784 slovakia does not recognise kosovo and therefore it does not recognise the kosovar passports
2046785 we are a nation that easily finds other solutions we dont have only one passport

2046797 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
2046798 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends

2046894 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2046895 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will

2046970 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted

2046973 as you know every university is different in dealing with gift dollars
2046974 i added the required sentence needed to your letter otherwise they will consider it a grant and they will charge me for overhead thanks for taking care of this political issue
2046975 removing a tenured faculty member is one of the most serious measures a university president can take
2046976 i asked myself is it acceptable to keep on the faculty a professor who intentionally misrepresented contract payments as gifts concealing this fact from the university for many years with result the university was deprived of indirect costs potentially approaching 400 000
2046977 as president i believe there is one and only one decision appropriate in response to these actions dismissal as a faculty member at the university of nevada reno
2046978 i had no hope in the board for many reasons
2046979 it had been informed a long time ago about pornography at unrs police department and took no action former unr president john lilley violated facultys rights for years and the board did nothing nobody is willing to do the right thing which is why they have so many lawsuits

2046990 abu fanas monks cultivated the land without government consent they now want to claim ownership the land though belongs to the government not to the monks or the bedouin
2046991 the word persecution suggests legal discrimination between citizens something that does not exist in egypt egypt has no laws for the majority and others for its minorities
2046992 i dont know how best to describe the current copt government stand off over the abu fana monastery for many the problem appears no more than a dispute over a piece of land that has spilled over into sectarian strife
2046993 it is possible that there could be some sales from central banks that have sold gold under this agreement but which have not sold gold in this year but it is unlikely
2046994 it is hard not to be bullish especially compared with the situation just a few years ago
2046995 gold sales could quickly pick up again perhaps if the dollar was to strengthen and the gold price slipped

2047019 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2047020 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2047021 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2047022 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
2047023 either way we need to keep every option open if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2047024 its up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage
2047025 iran confirmed its message when it stood against the whole world to deceive and to reject their aim is to obtain an atomic bomb

2047028 the princess is fat and you dont want her anymore
2047029 again though any polite response that differs from the original argument is ridiculed by the administration or called trolling
2047030 it is almost just a relief youre just trying to please the person who has taught you eveyrthing you want to show them that you can be just as perfect as theyve trained you to be youre afraid to make mistakes youre afraid to let them down even though you wouldnt
2047031 for him to have told me that that as long as i went out there and did my best and he knew i had done my best no matter what happened he would have been happy it made me have a lot more confidence in myself because i knew if i went out there and made mistakes it wouldnt be the end of the world
2047032 i think that is so helpful to her that he gives her permission to be imperfect to be human
2047033 its as simple as go do your best and truthfully thats all anybody can do
2047034 as many times as i talk to the girls i have eight or 10 girls in my group i tell them you are all like sisters
2047035 its not necessarily that i like you more than i like her or whatever and one of the girls might like or might not like sister one better than sister two but we all have to help each other and enjoy each other
2047036 she knows i care about her seeking perfection i care about how she hits her routines beautifully but there is no pressure if she is making mistakes from me or li
2047037 we are just there to help prepare her so she can perform beautiful routines shes a human being we have to realize that
2047038 she has a great personality she enjoys herself on the floor and in the gym also i cant say enough words enough great things about this kid she is a loving person and very respectful
2047039 she is the world champion the all around champion she is a huge star but she is also like a normal kid helping the younger kids moving the mats just like all the little things the other kids are doing there are no exceptions for her
2047040 im very proud of what she does on the floor
2047041 but i am also very proud of her for who she is as a real person
2047042 it was trouble free but its only practice and doesnt count for very much theres not much in it which is exactly what i expected
2047043 anywhere near moscow folks were naturally heartbroken about the loss of the bridge but i was also struck at how much it affected people in distant parts of the state so i resolved to find some way to recover this part of our indiana heritage
2047044 as much as we all care about the bridge it would never make the cut for spending hoosier tax dollars so the best way to do this in the true hoosier way is in barn raising fashion everyone we asked to help jumped at the chance
2047045 jim schellinger was one of the people i talked to early on about helping he was excited and indicated that cso architects welcomes the opportunity to lead the private fundraising efforts to reconstruct such an important piece of hoosier history
2047046 i drove by the covered bridge in bridgeton regularly and i know how the people in moscow feel i know this can be done and its my obligation being an indiana resident to do what i can
2047047 the hardwood industry has a long history of giving and we just think its an obligation to help with this
2047048 hopefully once things get going things will go smoothly if a lot of parents start taking their children to the drop off points that will shorten the routes and make pick up times a little later
2047049 that way well know if we have to worry about picking them up at home
2047050 they should also let us know if the children should be dropped off at the central point after school as well rather than at home
2047051 just give us a little leeway these first few days
2047052 im expected to play a big role on the team
2047053 the canucks have made a 20 million two year offer will sundin be largely motivated by the big bucks i wouldnt think so hes been the third highest paid player in the nhl since 1990 91 earning some 74 042 632 his total yearly totals have only been exceeded by jaromir jagr who earned 99 874 893 and joe sakic who has earned 87 174 047 since the 1988 89 season ironically jagr has left the league and sakic may retire
2047054 gordon most recently groomed up and comers david krejci and vladimir sobotka
2047055 we can work together and respect each others contracts and down the road we could possibly have a joint union of leagues or we can go to war
2047056 i know theres still a month left but i can taste it
2047057 i really want to work on my speed and my explosiveness again
2047058 the money theyve given to the church now its being spent on foolish acts
2047059 thats four thousand dollars less that could be put towards helping some one in need
2047060 recently the congress passed with my support important legislation that expands the education benefits for our returning service members
2047061 listen to what i say but dont pay any attention to what i do
2047062 many international buyers recognize that real estate is an excellent investment and are drawn today by abundant inventory low interest rates and a softer dollar
2047063 these conditions allow them to own their own piece of the american dream
2047064 today is a big day for beijing and china the beijing olympic games starts from today i will say that we are ready and beijing is ready
2047065 the preliminary football games have started and they have gone well so far people are excited about the games and the opening ceremony tonight i would not disclose much of the secret but we did have three rehearsals to let people have glimpse of what it is going to be except for the most top secret one
2047066 outside the air quality is good though it looks a bit misty we cannot judge the air quality by its appearance but should trust the finding i think tonight we will be lucky usually if morning is misty the night will be much better
2047067 for drizzle everything will just continue for shower i think during our second rehearsal we have some kind of rain but the performance was continuing if the rain gets heavier something will be modified we have contingency plans for three kinds of scenarios
2047068 the games is international so we not only want to showcase the culture and history of china but also try to be international and understandable to our friends of the world
2047069 we spare no efforts in terms of making the games safe the security forces have been reinforced and we share intelligence with the worlds intelligent agencies
2047070 hopefully the good luck will be brought to the opening ceremony lets have our fingers crossed and have a good time tonight
2047071 clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination seems to be no more effective than expectant management in couples with unexplained fertility
2047072 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2047073 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2047074 still at the end of the day a bit of a challenging first half we grew revenue were profitable but its not a high margin
2047075 we would like to think we could operate with a net profit before tax margin of fifteen percent and we have that in some of our lines but if you take the 1 4 million and divide it by the 25 million revenue it looks more like seven and a half percent we already have about 60 percent of our income contracted a year or more in advance so thats good for stability but some of those longer term contracts are obviously very stable but slightly more modest margin you cant have it both ways
2047076 though the airport is on our list of negotiations with india they will first have to agree to the project and second a techno economical viability study is needed
2047077 after all the investment required is huge and so it has to be a very well considered decision

2047081 the general public needs to know clearly the future status of their land
2047082 we have a whole of business wholesale agreement with telstra and we have been pushing for this adsl2 every since they introduced adsl2 at first they did not want to do it but they have come around and we have worked with them throughout the process
2047083 we have worked with telstra to engineer a product that is high quality and supported by a premium network configuration so it actually delivers on the benefits of superior technology and gives users a high speed hassle free experience
2047084 provide an opportunity to debunk some of the myths around broadband technology
2047085 there tends to be a consumer perception that all adsl2 services are higher speed and higher quality compared to standard adsl services thats not always the case because many adsl2 offerings in the marketplace are highly contended low cost products that actually offer slower speeds than for example a high quality 8mbps adsl service
2047086 we dont operate at the low end of the market with 19 95 offerings
2047087 the database will help us get access to personal information of the workers we have already placed the idea which has immediately been accepted by the government now we are making a formal proposal to place it before the government soon

2047097 as mr thomas runs towards these two officers between them the female officer tasers mr thomas in his left buttocks and left upper back
2047098 they believe the medics and police they think they have a drug overdose
2047099 you had two officers that really brutally stomped him out
2047100 one had his hand balled up tight he roared back and he punched him with all his might he turned around he grabbed his wrist and started shaking his hand the guys body jumped off the ground the next thing i seen the guy was regurgitating a few seconds later the last breath i believe he took was his leg shaking and then there was no more movement
2047101 the ride is a big challenge for all the cyclists particularly given the scorching heat in the visiting countries at this time of the year

2047108 i think thats a question best left to the discretion of the mechanics in the shop dont you after all theyre the ones hard at work fixing your car
2047109 is that setting an arbitrary deadline from the counter of this auto body shop is the surest guarantee that your car will break down as soon as you drive it out of the shop that wont just be a disaster for you it will disrespect all the hard work the mechanics have been doing on your car
2047110 we think its important to support our mechanics to the fullest it would be irresponsible to speculate on the full price since thats up to them really but having had a look at your finances were confident you can afford the total cost
2047111 a djustments should be left to the discretion of gen petraeus
2047112 not forced on our troops by politicians in washington with a 6 000 mile congressional screwdriver

2047128 my mother was born in cincinnati and her parents lived on the border with kentucky for a while

2047137 at corresponding engine speeds the vessel was consuming up to 6 less fuel depending on weather conditions after the application of intersleek 900 we originally calculated projected savings based on a bunker price of 450 and found we were saving nearly three tonnes of fuel a day and whilst bunker prices continue to climb our payback period just gets shorter the added advantages of no biocides reduced drydocking times and lower co2 emissions convinced us that this is the technology we need
2047138 for me it is best just to think of it as a number
2047139 but then i knew what to expect when i picked this number
2047140 i actually asked for no 8 at first but vic akers said that samir nasri had it so i was not complaining there then he said no 14 was available so straight away i said ill have that
2047141 we are pleased that in bringing our sec filings up to date we are also able to report solid results for the first nine months of our fiscal year

2047146 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2047147 i did not start the final of the champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2047148 it is nonsense to say that england does not have players capable of competing on the international stage

2047152 we continue to view st louis as an important location for tiaa cref
2047153 the staffing realignment is to better serve our clients needs
2047154 theres a reason why so many people had so many things to speculate about because theres a ton of different paths that lead to doom
2047155 dns should not have been capable of this much damage
2047156 why was such a stupid simple bug capable of breaking this many things
2047157 we had a choice back at our summit in march
2047158 we could either do point fixes or we could drop the sledge hammer and finally raise the odds from one out of 65 000 to one out of hundreds of millions

2047164 the plantations sector was the highest contributor to profits helped by a continued strong market for tea and rubber
2047165 this was followed by the transportation sector which also exceeded expectations the groups business in agri inputs recorded a creditable result as well
2047166 however a major part of the groups business which is in export manufacture and domestic production of agri products continues to be affected by inflation the effect of which is not countered by any depreciation of the sri lanka rupee
2047167 you can post it on your blog no one reads that
2047168 there was interest last summer but it didnt quite happen for whatever reason im just glad to find myself here now
2047169 i think this is a great opportunity for me to try and win something i think at the minute villa are a notch above boro and theres a great opportunity for me to play european football as well
2047170 the chance of european football was definitely an important factor in my decision you always want to test yourself at the highest level
2047171 i had a brief stint playing european football at spurs but that was almost ten years ago and it will be great to get another chance this season
2047172 this was a serious impact the bus and and the tractor trailer hit at the front corners the bus then went in to the ditch after about three or four feet then sort of embedded itself in to the ground
2047173 our leadership visits enable participants to examine the successes and challenges of another community in the hopes of further enhancing our already exceptional quality of life

2047179 war started today in south ossetia when georgia attacked russian peacekeepers in the disputed region
2047180 if its not war then we are very close to it the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
2047181 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2047182 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2047183 about 1 400 people have died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2047184 in accordance with the constitution and the federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2047185 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2047186 most of south ossetias territory is liberated and is controlled by georgia
2047187 i want to acknowledge that several hours ago i as a supreme commander have issued a very painful order not to return fire in response to a very intensive shelling of georgian villages
2047188 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2047189 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
2047190 the actions by georgia in south ossetia bear witness to the fact that the leadership of that country can no longer be trusted
2047191 with advanced advertising cable operators can provide a unique value proposition to advertisers who want to target the subscribers who best fit their product or service this is accomplished by unlocking the many sources of audience qualification information that exist or are emerging across cable operators systems and subscriber bases as well the ability cable operators have to identify specific viewing preferences and habits and to track viewing behaviour on a granular basis is critical to the success of advanced advertising
2047192 based on their internet advertising experience advertisers are also increasingly looking for tv advertising to support a more rapid automated campaign creation and execution process along with accurate reporting of the campaign results

2047197 u said dont get caught up in sin physically emotionally or sexually and yet u physically touch me emotionally like me amp sexually want me i deserve to be treated like a woman
2047198 i think everybody views my mom as a cool mom

2047200 since then it has evolved to where i will leave messages have a nice day dont forget to do this that kind of thing and shes responded to me as well
2047201 it can embarrass the kids and their friends and create resentment
2047202 totally wired what teens and tweens are really doing online
2047203 where it gets tricky is whats happening on social networking sites is really conversations between teens and their friends youre not just listening in on your own teen suddenly you are hearing what all their friends are doing as well
2047204 i really cant recommend that parents get accounts for the sole purpose of monitoring their children i think whats more important is parents need to engage their kids in dialogue about what is and what isnt appropriate to be posted online
2047205 other than the front door you come through at myspace com you might never see the same content or have the same experience

2047207 its become an easy way to interact with her to keep her in my life
2047208 it will be a lot easier than making phone calls
2047209 whether its kids or its gang activity were taking it seriously
2047210 its getting better some people are scared to come to this side of town but theres nothing wrong with it weve got a lot of people who are close knit
2047211 we have a situation where its sort of a national disgrace that the federal government has yet to make a firm ongoing sort of commitment to the long term health needs of those injured by 9 11 and so its really past due for congress and the bush administration to do the right thing here
2047212 i hope the rest of the congress takes it seriously and passes it and this current administration doesnt block and signs it
2047213 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2047214 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2047215 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2047216 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2047217 usually because i have to do a lot of work but i do like the lunch

2047226 pana acum am achizitionat 200 de mii de tone cantitatile venite fiind de trei ori mai mari decat in anii trecuti
2047227 anul acesta s a obtinut grau sub indicii de panificatie in proportie de 70 ceea ce inseamna ca majoritatea va fi destinat exportului si furajelor multi il vor combina cu grau de o calitate mai buna si il vor folosi in morarit
2047228 micii agricultori nu au unde sa tina graul recoltat si se roaga de depozitari sa il primesca la preturi foarte mici acestia la randul lor il vor amesteca cu grau mai bun si il vor vinde in octombrie la preturi ridicate
2047229 am obtinut 5 tone ha dar mie imi revine doar 33 din cantitatea totala vreau sa il vand cu 0 52 de lei kg pentru ca am nevoie de bani dar pana acum nu a fost nimeni interesat pentru ca oferta este foarte mare daca nu voi reusi il mai pastrez pentru ca am cantitate mica si spatiu suficient dar alti agricultori care au recoltat mult mai mult nu au ce sa faca si vor merge sa l vanda la comercianti

2047238 offering an opportunity to pursue the most efficient housing options as a 1 600 bed modern constructed prison sits empty
2047239 thomson will allow us to single cell a greater proportion of the maximum security inmates at pontiac which is mostly segregation and protective custody

2047252 although these securities have long term maturities of many years they historically have been offered for sale at weekly or monthly auctions however in early 2008 the market for auction rate securities dried up and the auctions through which they were sold experienced widespread failures when an auction fails liquidity disappears from the market as it becomes difficult to dispose of such securities at all let alone at par value

2047268 for a bus not to come and children not to have a way to school it makes it rough
2047269 you cant trust every old woman that comes up to you with a sob story or sympathy story
2047270 they basically use their smooth talk to gain the confidence of the victims

2047272 even if he is acquitted of the charges before him hed still be considered an enemy combatant and therefore would continue to be subject to detention

2047274 in addition to plenty of beaches and sun barack obama will see some of the highest gas prices in the country when he vacations in hawaii
2047275 obama deserves a break from the campaign trail just like americans deserve a break from high gas prices obamas opposition to offshore drilling will only make it harder for americans to afford their own family vacations
2047276 the same jury will hear the evidence decide guilt or innocence then decide whether the aggravating factors exist to warrant the death penalty then whether he should receive the death penalty
2047277 we anticipate that interest rates will stay at five per cent until the end of 2008 although we would not rule out a cut in november before being cut steadily to 4 25 per cent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 per cent by the fourth quarter of next year
2047278 we expect that very weak economic activity to increasingly contain and then dilute underlying inflationary pressures
2047279 this is basically the biggest licensing programme weve seen for a star wars game in recent memory and were doing a chunk of products that youd normally see for a film release
2047280 theres a novel based on the story of the game a comic book adaptation that looks at different characters point of view and a really gorgeous making of book featuring a ton of never before seen concept art furthermore hasbro has already launched a full wave of action figures including a fantastic painted rancor and a lightsaber that transforms from good to evil wizards of the coast has included several force unleashed characters in its miniatures role playing game and theres a lego version of the in game vehicle rogue shadow complete with a unique darth vader figure
2047281 the great thing about star wars is that it is one cohesive universe and everything fits together
2047282 whether a character first appears in a movie or a game or a comic book hes part of that universe and can interact with characters from the other media so fans are excited to have these characters immortalised as action figures or to experience the stories in different forms

2047289 asean has further ignored the plight of the burmese people who again in 2007 demonstrated against the injustices perpetrated against them
2047290 the saffron revolution of 2007 was also brutally suppressed and asean has yet to hold the burmese junta accountable for its actions
2047291 conditions have since worsened in burma as a result of the devastation left by cyclone nargis and the poor management of this crisis by the present military junta leaves the people of burma living in deplorable conditions
2047292 aipmc disappointingly notes that to date the measures taken by asean leaders to address the humanitarian and political crisis in burma have been insufficient and unsatisfactory
2047293 burma continues to face rampant inflation poor healthcare the unceasing use of child soldiers and the continued imprisonment of political prisoners asean leaders have failed to ensure that with the inclusion of burma into asean the junta are compelled to respect the rights of its people
2047294 we want asean leaders to ensure that the military junta is held accountable for all the injustices perpetrated by establishing an asean human rights mechanism to look into this matter this must be done in accordance to international human rights standards and principles found in the asean charter

2047307 it was my favorite number growing up and i always joked that i would get married on 8 8 08 its just a coincidence but i think that eight is lucky anyway

2047321 media reports concerning alleged debts incurred by companies connected to referee mark clattenburg
2047322 pgmo is aware of media reports concerning alleged debts incurred by companies connected to referee mark clattenburg
2047323 it has been decided he will not officiate any matches pending enquiries into the background to these reports
2047324 the fa has also decided to appoint peter walton as referee for sundays fa community shield between manchester united and portsmouth in place of mark clattenburg
2047325 it is in the best interests of mark clattenburg and the game that these reports are fully investigated and during that time he will not referee any matches
2047326 mark clattenburg is one of englands leading referees and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly
2047327 we are deeply disappointed and dejected by this step of the centre specifically union minister pranab mukherjee that he has allowed taslima to return to india
2047328 we are looking forward to a positive response from the centre
2047329 the centres step has definitely hurt sentiments of the muslim community in india

2047333 its unreasonable to move forward regarding the elections without releasing these political detainees because this issue relates to all agreements and dialogue issues involving the ruling party
2047334 other unresolved issues remain under discussion including the relative list and womens representation in parliament as well as the mechanism of casting votes in the supreme commission for elections and referendum
2047335 voting within the scer should be based on agreement and a majority on issues such as declaring election results and legislation
2047336 gpc and jmp leaders agreed on the election law amendment suggested by the government
2047337 the failure of dialogue between the jmp and the gpc is a result of the derogatory manner in which the gpc treats such dialogue as well as its lack of commitment to the results of such dialogue
2047338 welch said she does not trust the outside firm kilpatrick amp associates of chapel hill that will be investigating the police department because it was selected by town officials
2047339 we have not determined if the body is a male or female or the exact age
2047340 i just tried to help him he was homeless and didnt have any place to go
2047341 he must have got drunk and smoking and went to sleep
2047342 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2047343 i dont know if its a prank or someone wanted him for scrap it took a lot of guts to get him that far
2047344 but they didnt get away with him thank goodness hes one of a kind
2047345 needless to say we are upset that someone tried to take him
2047346 i never even considered it really that rudy would be targeted by thieves it seems like you cant have anything anymore without someone trying to steal it
2047347 hes got some scratches and battle scars thats going to need to be taken care of
2047348 the last day is the biggest one that is what we are expecting
2047349 its a pretty small ballot and there is not a lot to vote on in churchill county
2047350 i feel they know about the people that are running
2047351 anytime the most precious and vulnerable members of our community are injured it is tragic
2047352 when theyre injured as a result of a vicious and savage act of abuse and neglect its utterly repulsive
2047353 i dont think i won the gold because i had my name changed if so i should have swept all three gold medals
2047354 i could have avoided the surgery and played more if this was not the olympic year
2047355 but ive got my family my wife and kids there so it helps
2047356 we were just out on a normal patrol with the afghan national army in the lead
2047357 we were going to give the national blankets and all kinds of things
2047358 we heard there were casualties and they were still shooting at us
2047359 i didnt even think about it until the next day i got him a helicopter and he survived
2047360 i prayed every night for 15 months obviously it worked
2047361 you know no matter how old they are they are still mothers baby
2047362 weve only seen him 30 days in the last three and a half years
2047363 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2047364 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2047365 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2047366 weve been waiting for a long time to cut our hair
2047367 they got to go to the hospital and see what the money was going to and see how blessed and privileged they are
2047368 i told them this could really be their mission in life to grow their hair out to donate
2047369 it makes me feel good to donate my hair it will be so exciting to see my hair in a wig on somebody
2047370 i thought it would take longer to comb through it
2047371 this is something that they wanted to do for a while we try to teach them the importance of giving and helping and being a part of the community
2047372 in the beginning it was unusual for people to donate
2047373 a lot of young girls are growing their hair just to donate it
2047374 over the past four years kathy has effectively led canwests canadian broadcasting division through a period of strong growth and significant change
2047375 she has positioned the company for growth going forward through both her strategic initiatives and strong leadership we are fortunate that she has built an outstanding senior leadership team and leaves the business with great momentum
2047376 in 2004 i made a four year commitment to leonard and canwest to transform the canadian broadcasting assets and position them for strong future growth
2047377 with a solid foundation now in place and with the integration of the former alliance atlantis assets progressing smoothly its time to pass the baton
2047378 im committed to canwest its success and a smooth leadership transition and i have no doubt that the outstanding management team in the broadcasting division will enjoy tremendous success in the future
2047379 my feeling however is that we should try and organise a similar monthly bi monthly meeting for manchester bloggers and i even volunteer to send the meeting reminders on facebook as and when necessary
2047380 it will mainly be a bulk warehouse with fast moving goods not a full warehouse like we had in the past we have listened to the concerns of south island resellers we need to communicate closely with them to make sure we have the right type of stock in the warehouse
2047381 south island resellers would rather deal with someone who has a local presence the one proviso i have would be that they keep sufficient stock of the products they sell the most of otherwise we would have to wait for internal stock transfers
2047382 it would be best to keep him in prison just a little while longer so he could help to rehabilitate other inmates
2047383 the bids for the front street project came in way over our engineering estimate so well have to re bid we wont have all of our ducks in a row for the work to be done by october
2047384 well try to expedite the process but anytime a bid comes in more than 10 percent above the engineering estimate it has to be reviewed and sent back out for bids
2047385 the front street construction is now definitely a non issue for our festivals this year
2047386 both of these properties are in foreclosure and it is evident to me that the banks are not considering demolition at this time
2047387 this phase of the project addresses the northern corridor of davis avenue i live on rathbone terrace and it would not affect me directly
2047388 they use power tools under supervision of course and actually build things
2047389 they get to be creative using what they find in the wood lot to build shelters its fun
2047390 i like hiking in the wood lot and playing around in the gym
2047391 we do a fake crime scene and the kids collect evidence and analyze it
2047392 we would advise homeowners to continue saving well spending responsibly and to remain aware of the potential problems facing the housing market your financial planning should as always be geared towards making sure you are prepared for any problems that could arise
2047393 the report is only speculative and as with anything it is very hard to predict what will happen in the next five years the predictions are essentially a best case scenario
2047394 in a sense its healthy to be slightly cautious when it comes to money especially with an important financial commitment like a
2047395 falling house prices means that equity tied up in the value of your home is decreasing so its wise to try and counteract that by saving money where possible
2047396 this also acts as a buffer if you find the interest on your mortgage payments going up in the next few years which is quite possible
2047397 likewise its important to keep an eye on spending and make sure unnecessary purchases are kept to a minimum avoid taking out consumer finance loans on expensive goods as they can become a big financial burden when things get tight
2047398 in fact avoiding any form of personal loans or credit is the best defence against getting into debt
2047399 many homeowners will be relatively unaffected by the problems in the housing market so long as they are willing to stay put
2047400 a loss in the value of your home only affects you if you are looking to sell but it still pays to save well in case of emergency and once the market does recover you may even find yourself in a better financial situation than you were before all the trouble started
2047401 its great to be able to lend our support to the games media awards there are various awards programmes that celebrate the work of video games publishers and retailers but as the people who publicly champion games on a daily basis its good to recognise the medias contribution to our growing industry too
2047402 now theres a renewed focus on excellence in this country i dont believe winning is everything but it is important to strive to be the best in the world
2047403 i remember don saying he wanted australia to be the no 1 swimming nation in the world
2047404 in the 1970s and 1980s i believe we as canadians had the best club system in the world victor davis was with cliff barry i was at laurentian university talbot was coaching at lakehead university but we lost the ball
2047405 they swim if it doesnt work out they try something else here in canada our kids try everything else then swimming thats not completely true but its not far off were working on it
2047406 in atlanta we were on the turn we had not changed not improved and we were being superseded by nations who were doing a lot more with their top athletes we were trying to be fair to everyone and i have no problems with that but you have to concentrate on the best it produces results at the world level
2047407 weve got a lot of really good kids coming into the system were trying to get them tough then well get them fast by tough i mean theyve got to have it and feel relaxed being under pressure
2047408 i believe it all revolves around the coach if we get the best people in position it should be athlete centred coach driven i think the fundamentals are here and were starting to bring in good coaches were going in the right direction
2047409 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2047410 we wish phil the best of luck hes a great singer amp a great friend right now were just anxious to find a replacement and keep moving forward weve been working hard writing amp recording a ton of new material and its coming out amazing a lot of things have been coming together for us personally and professionally as a band so we figured now would be as good a time as any to announce that we are looking for a singer this whole situation has re energized us so to speak and these new songs are coming out heavier then our previous stuff and its really exciting
2047411 ha see you sucker ill make sure to wave at you as i walk down the runway at bryant park
2047412 they lookin at me like youre gonna get kicked off for that leather but you know what dont worry about me worry about that plaid youre picking up okay
2047413 theres a lot of bikers in this country that watch the oympics
2047414 people are crabby people are fighting over machines i mean its total whackadoodle
2047415 theres too much drama cause theres too many queens around
2047416 the entire room was from the 20s all the way up to like the 70s the past is in the past and id just rather stay in the future i live in 08 its 08
2047417 there are some cute ideas here somewhere buried deep below his complete disregard for the brief

2047420 i know nbc didnt want to lose conan obrien so they promised him the
2047421 ive consistently said im very happy being a senator for new york i love my work i love representing the people of new york
2047422 t his is a very personal decision for senator obama and i have no inside information as to how he is proceeding with his decision
2047423 im out there supporting him doing everything i can to make sure he gets elected and i will do same for whatever ticket there is
2047424 i will do whatever i can or whatever im asked
2047425 i agreed to take the vp slot on the specific condition that caroline kennedy agrees to take my seat in the senate her uncle bobbys seat if asked by the governor new york gets one strong feminist senator replacing another
2047426 i want a candidate that is compatible that will support my policies etc etc
2047427 if obama waits too long even hillary will not be able to convince her supporters to go along with the ticket
2047428 i sat in that black racist church for over 20 years and never heard such rhetoric rev wright is my mentor
2047429 it was a thrill to get 92 goals but in some ways i thought i let myself down by not getting 100
2047430 if he scored two he wanted three he always wanted more all stars have a love for the game what separates players like wayne is the passion hes like michael jordan they take it to the next level
2047431 charlie huddy took a shot from the left point that bounced off the boards and right to me at the corner of the net and i put it in
2047432 flyers forward bill barber said that if i were going in alone on an empty net for the 50th goal hed throw his stick giving him an automatic goal
2047433 that would have made a great trivia question how i scored my 50th goal without putting the puck into the net
2047434 five goals against the flyers in edmonton it was unbelievable with wayne you never knew what youd see i just liked sitting on the bench watching him
2047435 that was bittersweet for me that night i was at home in edmonton packing my apartment i had just been told i was heading to the minors i watched it on tv watching through my tears as gretz got 50 goals it was incredible to watch
2047436 i think gretz became the ultimate opportunist if you gave him something hed take it whether it was an opportunity to pass the puck or shoot the puck
2047437 he was seeking out and trying to find opportunities to create offense and whatever you gave him he was prepared to take
2047438 around the 25th game actually game 24 against los angeles on nov 25 i had another four goal game that gave me 28 and its when i knew i could get 50 in 50 games that was the benchmark set by rocket richard and mike bossy
2047439 he started to recognize the fear that goaltenders had of him
2047440 not the same kind of fear that bobby hull generated this was more like whats he going to do with the puck and wayne didnt waste shots he had a deceivingly hard shot a good backhand and could shoot a change up
2047441 i played with a lot of great players glenn anderson messier paul coffey but to see that record of 92 goals was extraordinary wayne was dedicated focused and he played every night
2047442 its hard to fathom hard to believe a guy could come in and get that many goals in one year break every record we were young guys and we idolized guys like phil esposito gretz had a lot of respect for the eras before him thats why he was so special he was very humble even when he scored 92 goals thats why i have so much respect for wayne
2047443 werent we talking a few years ago about whether anyone was going to score 50 again and were surpassed that
2047444 i think theres a general consensus within the nhl community that offense is vital and we have to find ways to create more offensive opportunities and have more goals scored under those circumstances i think theres the possibility that someone might get the chances to score 92 whether they do or not is another question
2047445 ovechkin has the release and hands that bossy had hes got the quickness that jari kurri had and hes got the toughness that mark messier had hes the whole package he just loves to score
2047446 although market conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations we generated approximately 390 million of cash flow from operations this quarter bringing the year to date total to 1 4 billion and increasing our homebuilding cash balance to 819 million we also maintained our focus on controlling our costs reducing our homebuilding sg amp a expenses by approximately 73 million in our quarter ended june 30 2008 compared to the year ago quarter
2047447 i was coming from work on madison ave and obviously its only about a mile generally it takes two minutes it took 25 today it was pretty much bumper to bumper traffic it looked like a parking lot
2047448 we had a plate from the car and a hub cap and it just gets stuck and thats what makes everything elevate but it does all the time sometimes its leaves but it could be pretty much anything
2047449 we have a long history of enhancing call centre productivity with sophisticated contact centre applications direct integration with mitel is a further demonstration of the openness of our technology and our ongoing commitment to offering the most flexible options to our customers
2047450 as one of the best selling cars in america the popularity of the accord can be traced to its combination of refinement quality sporty feel safety equipment fuel efficiency and long term value
2047451 other cars can claim some of those traits too but only the accord reaches consistently higher in more of the areas that matter most
2047452 i believe i cheated death several times but now im ready for a meal
2047453 i would say hes got six weeks left with you
2047454 romantically its probably not clicking thats a computer term clicking i learned it from him lets just say he hasnt clicked my mouse
2047455 the geeks are gonna love rachel because theyve all seen and you know seen it again with their right hand if ya know what i mean
2047456 now i know how he feels on the red carpet
2047457 not that ya know nicole kidman wouldnt do something like this its just that they wouldnt
2047458 steve and i stopped dating because there wasnt really chemistry to begin with but we had lots of friendship chemistry
2047459 hes special and im happy to have him in my life boyfriend and girlfriend maybe not the best combo
2047460 one month after the fur ball steve got engaged obviously not to kathy
2047461 rachel and rob the geek still remain in close contact via email
2047462 kathy is still single and pretends to be on the d list
2047463 when and where did you meet kathy for the first time
2047464 sue asked if i could take it over and i responded i would be absolutely proud to take that it didnt matter how big it was i would get it there
2047465 up here people dont usually care what you do or what you drive they care about who you are
2047466 to get a reminder of that when they are in beijing of all the people who are going to sign this banner its just going to bring nothing but good things to them
2047467 i know people in this town would make a special trip down just to sign it
2047468 a lot of them know how hard these two have worked through the years and how many things they have had to sacrifice i think its also really special for the yukon to feel like they are a part of this and that is just another way they can be a part of it
2047469 i expect jeane to get a few tears in her eyes
2047470 its just such a good reminder that people havent forgotten they know the effort it takes and they are behind her no matter what and same with zach i dont know zach of course as well as jeane but i know jeane will be really touched
2047471 the purpose is to get them to see what these machines are like
2047472 when theyre crossing in front of a car the more they understand what the driver is dealing with the safer it will be for them and the driver
2047473 people have given me verbal descriptions of police cars and ambulances and fire trucks but its something else entirely to be inside one to feel it and experience it i know im not going to forget it
2047474 today she saw for the first time all the details a sighted person would see
2047475 they love it they want to hit the sirens and make some noise they put on the uniforms and check out the equipment
2047476 it gives them an idea of what we do and what we go through and it helps us get a sense of what they do and they go through
2047477 blindness is rare and because its not a visible disability like someone in a wheelchair or a cast its difficult for us to wrap our minds around it and that elusiveness of it makes it intimidating
2047478 the more people who understand blindness and learn to interact with it the better it will be for everyone seeing or blind
2047479 i was an adult i had a family my life as i knew it was over i had to relearn how to live all over again
2047480 i had nothing to lose i was lucky to survive my accident i had no job no career and the carroll center had given me the confidence to move forward and i decided i was just going to go for it
2047481 today a free track is available from the upcoming record that i did with brian eno im hoping that folks will be pleasantly surprised at the direction weve taken and the final result since its only one song it may give a skewed taste of the record but many told me its their favorite track i guess well see im also wondering whether the web curious will allow news of the album to spread more or less by itself in the past i might have undertaken all kinds of expensive marketing plans to prepare for a record release there would be a teaser live shows posters magazine ads interviews and advance cds sent to writers and reviewers weve done a few interviews but thats about it it will be interesting to see if audiences find out about this song and the record without all those marketing techniques and solely through internet word of mouth
2047482 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2047483 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2047484 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2047485 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2047486 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2047487 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2047488 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
2047489 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
2047490 arabs and turkomens are insisting on clearly written legal articles that assure their equal representation in all legislative and administrative bodies in kirkuk
2047491 the un proposal suggests delaying the elections in kirkuk to the end of this year in order to prepare a specific elections law for the city
2047492 the results of the market investigation did not identify any concerns on the overlap routes
2047493 we continue to work closely with the us dept of justice and remain confident that we will be able to finalize the merger by the end of the year
2047494 were really getting the paperwork caught up with the investigation
2047495 it could lead to some of our unsolved crimes as well
2047496 the majority of our investigators are working full time on this one case right now
2047497 certain people have deluded themselves into thinking that they can be somewhere and be 100 percent protected from violence and random acts of stupidity
2047498 the best thing you can do with something like that is continue to educate people about safety and staying together in groups then you need to have these people prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
2047499 students need to be aware that theyre in a more urban environment
2047500 theyre in an environment where theyre going to be dealing with people who arent necessarily there for the same reasons they are
2047501 im happy that both sides were able to recognize the value in reaching a resolution at this stage of the case which was somewhat earlier than these cases usually settle
2047502 the involvement of business people on the plaintiffs side really facilitated a settlement they pushed us and the defendants to be realistic about the case
2047503 this case has broader international implications and confirms the importance of allowing international investors access to u s courts when theyve been harmed by securities fraud
2047504 while there were other u s plaintiffs involved german and luxembourg institutions have been running the case
2047505 dekabank participated in every single mediation session much more actively than an awful lot of u s clients that weve got
2047506 i think sometimes courts are a little more skeptical of foreign plaintiffs than they are of u s plaintiffs and this case demonstrated that theres not really any reason for that kind of skepticism
2047507 although it has strong defenses to plaintiffs claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2047508 we are pleased to have such an outstanding group of investors supporting the ongoing effort to build a world class biology cro serving the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries

2047510 morningside is very pleased to lead the investment in hd bioscience joined by lilly asia ventures and pfizer ventures
2047511 at a time when multinational biopharmaceutical companies are seeking increased r amp d capacity in asia hd bioscience is emerging as a leading contract research organization with expertise in customized biology services the company led by a team of highly trained scientific professionals is well equipped to lead biotechnology development in china and meet industry needs worldwide
2047512 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream comes true
2047513 host to the present and a gateway to the future
2047514 apart from the complexity of the information that is required it is for a network thats not going to be built anyway since it makes no economic sense at all
2047515 the ftth trend started five years ago in south east asia japan and korea and has expanded to neighbouring countries like hong kong malaysia and singapore the us is also making good progress and europe is well and truly on its way britain is now seeing multiple investments in ftth following the example of the french where ft and its competitors began to fibre paris and other cities in full competition with each other and once the decision was made in new zealand to separate its incumbent ftth is all that is being talked about
2047516 each country has found its unique solution not one is the same but with investments flowing and the regulatory environment now well defined with the exception of the usa all these new networks are built on the principle of open networks and equivalence of services
2047517 i am pleased with our core operating results during the quarter as we achieved revenue growth in virtually all of our business segments with significant contribution from our employment training services unit driven by performance incentives and new contracts although the legal charge had a negative impact on the second quarter 2008 results the lawsuits do not affect core business operations or our acquisition strategy thanks to the strength of our operations leadership and commitment from our employees our underlying business fundamentals were positive in the second quarter despite a weak economic environment nationally
2047518 we will continue to invest in our service lines through strategic acquisitions to build our core businesses such as the acquisition of caregivers home health which closed in early july 2008

2047520 once more as in the case of the war on iraq the u
2047521 we regard the august 2 nationwide demonstration in the u s as a signal for a worldwide campaign to stop the war on iran before it starts
2047522 there is only one government that has used nuclear weapons against civilian populations and that same nation has the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction on the planet
2047523 iran has suffered greatly at the hands of the u s we recall the u s overthrew the democratically elected government of dr m mossadegh and returned the shah to the peacock throne the proudest achievement of the cia for 25 years the shah ruled iran with an iron fist for the benefit of u s oil corporations before the people of iran in the millions overthrew his tyranny at a terrible cost in lives for the past 27 years u s sanctions have impeded irans right to development and brought great suffering to the people
2047524 after palestine yugoslavia afghanistan and iraq it is now the turn of iran tehran has been long named head of the axis of the evil but washington had other pressing bellicose needs on the way to global predominance
2047525 the u s and its allies keep turning the spiral of escalation this time they have learnt their lesson from their hubris of omnipotence and have brought their european allies on board it is actually germany france and england who are preparing the aggression we have to build a broad movement against the warmongers defending irans national sovereignty drawing also the lessons of the iraq war namely that it will not be the europeans to stop the u s but the resistance of the aggressed peoples themselves which we must support

2047534 last year i felt very privileged and excited to be joining relentless suzuki it has been a fantastic experience and i have to be honest and say we have exceeded the results that i expected in my first year i will be looking to build on that again in 2009
2047535 i have formed a great relationship with the team and our sponsors ive also become very friendly with a lot of the crew philip and hector have been great to work for and philips input this season has really shown in my results
2047536 a big shout must also go to relentless and suzuki who have shown great enthusiasm which really inspired me this season hopefully we can finish on a high with some top british superstock results and a solid ulster grand prix next week
2047537 lismores growth has stalled because the city does not have sufficient urban residential lots to meet either the present needs of the city or to cater for expected future growth
2047538 the current lack of quality urban residential land means that aspiring buyers have had little choice in lismore and most have bought in other centres thats been good for places like casino and kyogle but its been at lismores cost
2047539 demand definitely hasnt slowed down during the past 10 years its just that there isnt enough land available
2047540 especially in a regional town the building industry is vital and so many people rely on it when the building industry is doing well the town is going well and the town is healthy
2047541 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2047542 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
2047543 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2047544 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself
2047545 we are very pleased to have been included in both of these magic quadrant reports in my opinion this reflects the reality of how businesses are using and benefitting from our leading multichannel commerce solutions and also the strength and success of our business and vision in the market

2047550 this exceptional designation from charity navigator differentiates goodwill southern california from its peers and demonstrates to the public it is worthy of their trust
2047551 goodwill southern california s consecutive high ratings give goodwill supporters peace of mind that their hard earned dollars are wisely spent
2047552 donations to goodwill are used to employ and support people with disabilities and vocational disadvantages having public support means wider program outreach and more job seekers placed into meaningful employment
2047553 the success of the wii in bringing gaming to the family and social market played a huge part in making big beach sports such a success
2047554 big beach sports was also the ideal candidate to be supported with a tv campaign which has proven essential in reaching our target audience of families and social wii gamers
2047555 i think to sum it up you have to look at what the consumer is looking for i see big beach sports as fast food gaming for the mass audience gaming you can consume in bite sized chunks
2047556 we had talked about this for years but never required a registration before
2047557 the decision was made this year on the recommendation of our attorney
2047558 the idea of registration is that way we know who is in the parade ahead of time
2047559 i think its a good thing and have no problem with registration
2047560 ive done some big parades over the years like sugar creek and zane trace and all of them ask a registration
2047561 one year we were all lined up ready to go and in came one or two groups late who wanted to get in front of us this is a good idea and even if they just put you in line as you register it would be good
2047562 its another indication that they are trying to prevent people with different viewpoints from being in the parade
2047563 they need to understand that this is a first amendment rights issue
2047564 i dont want to rub their noses in it i just want them to know that they dont have the right to kick you out without rights we have nothing
2047565 i have been with mid since the time of its spin off from magna international in 2003

2047571 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw

2047578 one of the objectives of the ait board is the continuous development our aim is the constant growth in terms of passenger number and route development inside and also outside the european union according to the markets demand we want to get more and more airline companies to operate from the largest regional airport in romania that is one of the most modern airports in the country benefiting from the latest infrastructure of the airline industry the presence of a low cost company that operates in timisoara is an attractive feature both for passengers and travel agencies as there is a huge demand for that timisoara international airport is open to any company interested in starting collaboration if it rises up to the necessary standards our opinion is that the presence of wizz air in timisoara will be a good alternative not only for the community but also for the airport commercially economically and financially as well

2047592 its about finding yourself and doing what you want to do and being true to yourself
2047593 and i think for a lot of people its difficult to do that
2047594 but when the vincent bugliosi fool says he wants to assassinate president bush the liberal left is silent in agreement
2047595 during a period of unprecedented challenges for the global aviation industry as a result of the continuously soaring oil prices we are extremely proud of these results which demonstrate air arabias ability to continue to deliver sustained growth and excellent returns to our investors we believe that air arabia enjoys the proper model and infrastructure needed to remain amongst the most profitable airlines in the world
2047596 participating in legislation and regulation that can affect the salvage auto auction industry is our responsibility to customers
2047597 illinois house bill 5204 further opens illinois doors to out of state buyers enhancing both the diversity of buyers as well as the demand for the vehicles and that benefits everyone in our market
2047598 in the salvage auto auction industry reasonable legislation is critical to the industrys overall health

2047623 el fabricante canadiense tiene m ltiples planes en movimiento para contrarrestar el momentum de apple entre los consumidores incluyendo un nuevo producto ya anunciado el bold y otros dos posibles el thunder y el kickstart
2047624 estos resultado muestran que los consumidores tienen inter s en las novedades de blackberry
2047625 los verdaderos perdedores en esta batalla ser n probablemente los participantes de segunda clase que podr an encontrarse cada vez m s desplazados del mercado
2047626 los clientes de apple parecen ser de los menos que comprar an cualquiera de los nuevos tel fonos de rim
2047627 el iphone ha capturado los corazones y las mentes de la base de usuarios y tambi n lo ha hecho el blackberry de rim
2047628 afortunadamente para ambos el mercado global de consumidor y empresario es lo suficientemente grande para soportar a ambos son todos los otros fabricantes los que van a perder

2047630 sectorul public aduce in continuare cele mai multe venituri aceasta zona pare a fi cea mai favorizata in mare datorita fondurilor structurale si fondurilor phare pe care le are alocate
2047631 estimarile pentru sfarsitul anului in curs raman valabile si chiar ar putea fi depasite
2047632 in 2009 cifra de afaceri a companiei va creste la 25 mil dolari 16 2 mil euro iar pentru anul urmator prognozam aproximativ aceeasi rata de crestere de aproximativ 5 mil dolari pe an
2047633 acest sector pare a fi cel mai favorizat in mare datorita fondurilor structurale si fondurilor phare pe care le are alocate
2047634 nu m am gandit sa vand merg pe ideea ca firma se poate autofinanta in prezent un furnizor de solutii software se poate dezvolta si din resurse proprii avand in vedere cererea in crestere pentru informatizare oportunitatile tot mai mari oferite de integrarea in uniunea europeana si implicit de fonduri structurale disponibile

2047639 cerner has had a comparatively successful launch when compared with other acute trusts and this is due to a large extent to our staff who have been exceptional
2047640 however this launch has not been without its problems some of which were anticipated
2047641 the additional time needed to place orders request appointments and to capture the 18 week pathway has resulted in frustration and in some cases delays to clinics
2047642 there have been significant issues around the administration processes for pre assessment waiting list management and the scheduling of theatre lists many of the issues identified have been due to a fundamental lack of understanding in relation to the software and workflow processes required
2047643 the main area of concern has been where doctors who run extremely busy clinics have found it impossible to use the system to its full potential due to time available and the timely response of the cerner system especially powerchart
2047644 booking follow up appointments which has been one of the areas proving most challenging to reception staff due to the length of time it takes for each patient
2047645 with unexpected crashes to the software occuring in some areas
2047646 it is anticipated that these will deliver far more streamlined processes particularly in relation to booking follow up appointments
2047647 with the implementation of any system of the size and complexity of crs we would expect some teething problems before the new system bedded in
2047648 senior teams from bt london programme for it and cerner have been working with the trusts technical team to identify and resolve some performance issues
2047649 as a result several initiatives have been put in place which have improved reliability and ensured that patient care is not compromised many of the problems we saw in the early weeks are now resolved
2047650 was bound to mean a review of agreed workflows as the system bedded in
2047651 i hope that now street dancers will know that they can learn all these different steps and come on so you think you can dance and possibly win

2047653 ive been so happy about performing because this is the last show todays been crazy
2047654 for two hip hop dancers to be in the final two was amazing
2047655 we told each other no matter who wins a hip hop person is taking it you dont know what we go through we literally cry we sweat together were all a family

2047658 you dont need to be in love with someone to connect
2047659 when they announced joshs name i think i was as happy as if theyd announced my name
2047660 because it transcended more than money i hope that inspired all hip hoppers to transcend a box because there is no box there are no limits
2047661 i dont have any plans because everythings been so planned for us for 10 weeks
2047662 i was one of the guys who put josh through to dallas so i was there from day one

2047678 after being promoted by michael corleone to don of new york players expand to new cities as they build up their families through extorting businesses monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in america
2047679 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2047680 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre
2047681 that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2047689 you have to have the time to work with your horse and the confidence to go out there
2047690 but once youre out there you can slow it down to slow motion where you can look at things and get adjusted
2047691 hed thrown every rider that ever got on him he ran over his last owner and broke her leg
2047692 right from the get go he trusted me that i wasnt going to hurt him or do bad things to him
2047693 i have never had a horse click that fast or that much
2047694 the changes in safety and environment reflect how important these issues are for foss
2047695 it is to our advantage to have multiple departments working together all invested in the success of our safety and environmental programs
2047696 nothing in the first amendment keeps the state from exercising its regulatory authority over the political process even when the politicking takes place in the sanctuary
2047697 that rally clearly constituted an in kind expenditure in support of a statewide initiative requiring short form disclosure under montanas campaign finance laws
2047698 the supreme court repeatedly has endorsed such disclosure under the first amendment
2047699 i am very excited to be playing once again in sault ste marie it has been a long time since i have been there and it will be great to see my fans once again in northern ontario

2047701 what are we going to do with all these shirts
2047702 its not as easy as youd think to give something like this away
2047703 so mercy corps was a huge help in getting the shirts into the hands of those abroad who could use them
2047704 im already so famous in austria so now its his hans pieter steinachers turn
2047705 on tablet pcs i definitely see open source being behind them
2047706 everyone sees the iphone model where you can sell your product to customers
2047707 if i can find a solution that beats all of our stuff costs less and is more applicable to our environment then thats what im looking for
2047708 this niche works because small businesses like dental offices cant afford to have a full time it guy
2047709 they usually have five to 25 pcs in an office and they have to outsource it small businesses will spend us 500 on a pc and think theyre done with it
2047710 a lot of the other teams are ranked pretty high in doubles and play together all the time
2047711 freddie while he obviously respects his opponents doesnt get intimidated by them i like that attitude
2047712 hes got a big game a big serve and he goes for his shots thats important especially in doubles when there isnt that much space on the court and its hard to break serve every match seems like its close and it comes down to a few points its a good sign that freddie has that mentality
2047713 there are eight to 10 teams that play the tour together full time and are good solid teams
2047714 i think if youre going to win a medal youre going to have to beat two or three of those teams
2047715 any time you have a top singles player on the court you know you have to be careful i dont think novak is a natural at doubles but just with his confidence playing singles theyre a very dangerous team but i dont consider them one of the top medal favourites
2047716 your favorite great blog post from other blog than yours
2047717 of course the main reason why students download textbooks is because textbooks are ridiculously expensive but it doesnt look like publishers are fighting back by lowering prices basically the textbook publishers are reacting in exactly the wrong way rather than focusing on ways to actually add value and make it worthwhile to pay theyre looking to come up with ways to lock people in and force them to pay thats bound to backfire eventually
2047718 poco dopo la diffusione della notizia dellincidente il titolo pininfarina stato sospeso per eccesso di rialzo in piazza affari facendo segnare in pre apertura un prezzo di 6 6 euro l11 44 in pi rispetto alla chiusura di ieri
2047719 so the question is what should we do to make publishers realize theres a whole big market out there for ebooks that they need to tap into its a market that will grow and they only start feeling the consequence of it when they suddenly realize the books are available as pirated downloads
2047720 the main driver at this point is the strength of the dollar without a doubt
2047721 clearly there is some demand from a portfolio perspective for gold in euro terms many investors liking the portfolio protection afforded by the yellow metal in an inflationary environment
2047722 silver is primarily taking its cue from the stronger dollar and weaker gold prices
2047723 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want

2047727 the strait of hormuz is an important and strategic strait considering its proximity to our shores it is completely within the range of our weapons and shutting the strait for an unlimited time is easily possible there are no limits for us in this regard

2047732 its hard to tell exact measurements holyoke had eight inches in about three hours the other night some places have had nothing
2047733 two nights ago less than a mile from the station there was five and half inches of rain in an hour and it never rained here
2047734 we reiterate our firm commitment to the project and are determined to move ahead in terms of land preparation and construction activities at full speed
2047735 from their inception the funds were doomed to fail because the bear stearns defendants conceived managed and deceptively marketed them knowing that they would be viable so long as but only so long as the us housing market continued to experience an unprecedented rise
2047736 the bear steams defendants also knew however that so long as they were viable the funds would generate massive unprecedented fees and other benefits for each of the bear steams defendants
2047737 in the last four weeks there have been 13 call outs and quite sure why that is
2047738 its quite bizarre never in 40 years have we had this many
2047739 but theres no obvious thing thats happening more were being called out to anything like the incident on wednesday to things like engine failure so no one thing can be to blame
2047740 its not really for us to comment on because a rescue is a rescue and theres no different way to treat it
2047741 certainly it has been a busy time for us and we do receive a lot of calls from cramond island
2047742 the times of the tide are clearly marked and our number is there perhaps people just go across and lose track of time
2047743 we would say that drinking and sailing are definitely a no go not only because it inhibits decision making and reaction time but because if youre underwater you go down a lot quicker with alcohol inside you
2047744 our results for the second quarter reflect strong end market demand and solid operating performance across our businesses
2047745 we are encouraged by the contributions of our newly acquired businesses and believe there is further upside as we move to optimize near and long term opportunities we are likewise pleased with our ability to translate strong business fundamentals into bottom line growth despite steeply rising raw material costs and unfavorable currency movements
2047746 i flew out here just to get you a card from colorado
2047747 greetings from parker colo its beautiful and hot having a great time
2047748 and not much of a driver either he just ran over your motorcycles
2047749 weve had some enquiries from villa over the last few days and theyve come up with an offer which we think is acceptable to us
2047750 sometimes an offer can be one that makes it very difficult to turn down its important that if he does move on were able to replace him very quickly
2047751 im very relaxed about it i know that come next saturday well have a strong team and a strong squad
2047752 you learn very quickly as a manager that you have to deal with these events calmly and quickly
2047753 it would be easy for people to get jittery at this time and to panic but im very pleased with where were at
2047754 this is an unexpected event but you have to deal with those events during a season and how you react is the most important thing
2047755 excoriated a whos who of tech companies including microsoft yahoo cisco systems and google for cooperating with chinese government policies on censorship
2047756 censorship is still rampant dissidents are still being arrested and held in detention and none of the companies have announced changes in their operating procedures or policies which would change either of those facts

2047759 we embrace the importance of balance for all and the belief that further work has to be done before its a truly balanced release protocol for all stakeholders above and below the smith mountain lake dam
2047760 not just those served by the smith mountain project but those downstream communities who draw water from the river itself
2047761 the draft release requirements are based on a complex computer model that analyzed at least 70 years of historical stream flow
2047762 this proposed comment is not balanced and is not ready to go to the water board yet from both parties standpoints
2047763 supplying drinking water is the most important aspect to what is going to take place in this permit the plan is only looking at the lake it does not look at the needs of drinking water downstream
2047764 the staunton river is a part of a lot of us
2047765 not only would this affect the people it will affect a lot of things what about the habitat of the fish what about the farms with cattle that depend on the river for water and drinking
2047766 we need the water level up to do our job properly
2047767 were the only ones on that lake that can help you
2047768 however each enterprise will view iphone through its own lens which will be heavily tinted by the organisations security and management needs
2047769 enterprises should approach expanded use of the iphone slowly and with close examination
2047770 ko kid berry 7 2 of las vegas by way of murrieta calif takes on ray lizama 5 5 of rancho cucamonga calif
2047771 i dont know what happened or why it was stopped he said
2047772 i wasnt hurt and felt completely fine i wanted to keep fighting i felt i could keep fighting i dont make excuses i absolutely want a rematch if he wants to give me one
2047773 i thought i had him dazed but i dont think he was completely out i was a little surprised the ref did what he did but only because i wanted to hit hamman again if he wants to fight again lets do it im down
2047774 i didnt think it would end that fast said the talented camoes who once went 27 minutes with anderson silva before losing
2047775 im very happy i wanted to give a spectacular showing i came to the u s to fight for the belt i look forward to fighting anybody that will get me closer to achieving my goal
2047776 its great to be involved with an international promotion of the caliber of elitexc
2047777 elitexc has a very promising female division im looking forward to fighting some of the top ones
2047778 it was the first time ive had to pull out of a fight said diabate whose only loss since july 2005 came to mauricio
2047779 i was doing light sparring with takedown defense one of my sparring partners did a takedown trapping one of my legs at the same time it was completely a fluke accident
2047780 i like to fight guys who stand up in bang
2047781 but with this guy i had to concentrate more on defense i thought the decision could have gone either way but i cant complain when you leave it in the hands of hands of the judges anything can happen
2047782 these findings indicate that the protective effect of soy against breast cancer risk differs by receptor status
2047783 its a tough deal it hurts its the hardest part of this game hardest part about coaching hardest part of playing especially a guy like that who does everything right hes one class away from graduation
2047784 its a blow to us because hes such a great leader great kid hes one of my favorite players of all time hes a popular guy and his teammates took it real hard
2047785 a lot of the guys went over to his house last night trying to encourage him and let him know everything is going to be ok hes got a good perspective about it
2047786 its tough its a game he loves to play it was going to be a big year for him and hes not going to be able to experience it its a little bit of a letdown for everybody
2047787 i dont think his future career in the nfl will be hurt on the fact hes not going to play this year
2047788 to have a sixth year you have to have two years lost to injury
2047789 im hoping the chemistry on this team is so strong that when one guy goes down youve just got to play a little harder
2047790 in the national championship year 2006 we had a starting offensive lineman ronnie wilson break his leg then two other ones get hurt really in the same practice
2047791 if you have a good team and some good players you can get a little tighter and go a little harder
2047792 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
2047793 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
2047794 what struck me was the complete depth of microsoft software that the updates will touch this month
2047795 the bug could be a cross over to multiple programs
2047796 we are quite deliberately in neutralise phase at the moment we dont want to fight the election on kiwisaver you got to decide what you want to fight the election on we want to fight the election on tax we want to the fight election on education standards we want to fight the election on law and order
2047797 theres a whole lot of bullshit talk about them but the policy decisions are always made by the elected representatives i havent seen either of them this campaign a couple of campaigns ive done a bit of work with them
2047798 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
2047799 its a good opportunity for people who want to migrate from minivans
2047800 no no im no mere soccer dad but an off road adventurer ready to answer the call of the wild
2047801 started heightening all employees awareness of the importance of customer data security and the inviolability of the secrecy of telecommunications i have explicitly encouraged my employees to inform us of any violations that come to their attention procedures have been established for this purpose such as the ethics hotline and the whistleblower process
2047802 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2047803 we have five different farms in this area fairly close to pasco and we have a farm next to broetje its more difficult to get people to drive out that far
2047804 anything that is done to provide more farmworker housing is a plus
2047805 we intentionally designed these townhouses to be flexible to the need we see for housing these units are spacious modern and able to accommodate individual agriculture workers or single families
2047806 a lot of growers who are considering on farm housing want to have the flexibility to either serve local workers or h2a workers
2047807 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
2047808 if you were sitting in a waiting room full of people and one person suddenly fell ill or died or something
2047809 would you arrest the person sitting right next to them
2047810 there is no precedent for that type of thinking and no data for that type of thinking
2047811 vaccines injured our child and youre just going to have to trust us on that even though we stand to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars for it
2047812 1 concession report this document has been removed due to the possibility of it being illegally obtained if people really wish to read the document for themselves it can be founf here at the huffington post
2047813 it did not go to hearing because of this concession you can say all you want about what the reasons are for it and we arent really at liberty to talk about what is actually in the document the concession that was made
2047814 this means that scientifically from the documents presented in the vaccine court the polings did not make a case that deserved compensation
2047815 tiger airways is pleased to announce that it has achieved a trading profit of sin 37 8m for the past financial year the last financial year was a very good year for tiger aviation as we successfully transitioned into a group structure launched tiger airways australia and our airline in singapore achieved a substantial trading profit in its third full year of operations
2047816 even with the challenging market conditions and current oil prices we remain confident about the long term success of both our asian and australian based airlines we continue to see strong demand for our low fares and we are committed to continued growth as we expand our operations in both australia and singapore
2047817 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2047818 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2047819 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2047820 however is that the result of the rfs mandate our conclusion is no
2047821 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2047822 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2047823 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2047824 the epa realized that the facts clearly stood in ethanols corner the bottom line is that ethanol is extending our fuel supply and actually lowering gas prices
2047825 every independent study has confirmed that using corn to make this cheap clean american made fuel has no significant impact on food prices
2047826 when food prices are rising and chicken companies are losing money because of high feed costs it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply
2047827 were driving green into every aspect of our global business
2047828 this includes setting new standards for energy efficiency and green power delivering environmental and cost savings for customers and aligning key growth priorities with our focus on preserving our shared earth
2047829 innovests ratings are an indicator of a companys performance on intangible value drivers and management quality this information is used to support an investors existing financial knowledge of a company it is widely accepted among investors that extra financial information is now required to get a full understanding of a companys prospects
2047830 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2047831 he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you
2047832 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2047833 on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2047834 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
2047835 no one can touch me no ones mine im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing
2047836 with our heavy boots we couldnt tell what it was
2047837 but i was standing on something thats when we noticed that i was standing on one of the victims
2047838 comme disait lancien cem de lusaf le g n ral fogleman surtout pour un monomoteur
2047839 partners who do not buy according to the program of record will cover the costs incurred by other partners
2047840 that is a matter for the u s government i cannot and will not answer that question
2047841 tiens comme a tombe bien d clencher une attaque le jour o tout le monde a les yeux tourn s vers p kin et les jeux olympiques
2047842 im so happy to have this opportunity to perform for people who will be there to really listen to and appreciate the blues and i think its cool that this came about by word of mouth because that means that people are digging my music and thats why i write and play
2047843 im overwhelmed by the support of my teachers family and friends its essential
2047844 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law
2047845 the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
2047846 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2047847 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2047848 we appreciate the epa taking a careful approach to the waiver request and agree with their determination that it should be denied
2047849 it is important to note that all renewable fuels qualify for the current rfs in fact if the rfs is waived or cut in half in 2008 then the growth of all biofuels including advanced biofuels such as biodiesel would be severely hindered
2047850 good intentions and laudable goals are small compensation to the families farmers and ranchers who are being hurt by the federal governments efforts to trade food for fuel
2047851 any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
2047852 now the states goal of bringing biofuels jobs and energy independence to texas and the nation can continue on a path to success
2047853 weve realized only a 2 48 percent increase in our assessed valuation
2047854 the group has been facing the most challenging economic conditions for decades which has reduced operational performance and has restricted investment in the groups brands
2047855 these conditions have prevented the group raising the further financing it needed the sale of the business has secured the jobs of 300 of the groups employees
2047856 a reduction in the amount of disposable income as a result of the current economic climate has played a role in the groups difficulties
2047857 securing a going concern sale of the business which will protect 300 jobs is positive news for the employees and the industry as a whole
2047858 no end in sight for housing boom the u s is poised for another strong decade
2047859 activity should wind down gradually from record levels rather than ending in a bust
2047860 what screams bubble giant historic bubble in real estate is the system wide extension of massive amount of credit
2047861 the unprecedented mass of vulnerable bonds extant today is on the verge of a waterfall of downgrading
2047862 investors in these companies stocks and bonds will be just as surprised when the stock prices and bond ratings collapse
2047863 like the discomfort of drug addiction withdrawal the discomfort of credit addiction withdrawal cannot be avoided
2047864 banks are not just lent to the hilt theyre past it in a fearful market liquidity even on these so called securities corporate municipal and mortgage backed bonds will dry up
2047865 i say that the guns dont match the gams he needs to work on his legs a little bit more
2047866 gt urban expositions the next show which will be organized by urban expositions will be held march 28 31 2009 at the boston convention and exhibition center
2047867 iraq and iraqis deserve much better than what they have now and arabs wish to help this is basically what i am here for
2047868 as representing the collective will of the arab member states
2047869 to my mind baghdad is always a prominent arab capital with enormous contributions through history now we in the arab world want baghdad to regain this status and we want to do what we can towards this
2047870 there are so many internal and external factors that i will have to work with my mission i understand is not just about building channels with all iraqi groups but of course to work closely and hopefully constructively with all those who could influence developments in iraq
2047871 iraqi reconciliation is a top priority for iraqis as much as for arabs
2047872 we will explore what it will take now to re launch the reconciliation efforts we can build on what we already did but we are aware that we will have to adopt new parameters that take into account the new political realities in iraq 2008 is not 2005 and we know this
2047873 this is very important several arab countries already have a diplomatic presence in the iraqi capital now the arab league mission which has been functioning since 2005 will be upgrading its presence and we hope that this will encourage a firmer arab rapport with iraq
2047874 security control is now much much better than what it used to be a couple of years ago or even last year
2047875 profound and effective political will on the part of arab countries
2047876 there was no interest in iraq or what the arab league mission was trying to do there simply none
2047877 the situation is now different in more ways than one
2047878 iraq is lost to iran for many years to come
2047879 sometimes before you find god you have to find yourself
2047880 we could start working immediately to get the levees up to the 100 year level
2047881 all of those things could be things we are doing now
2047882 i would say the chances are probably pretty good that it will happen
2047883 to give us their review and their opinion of it and at that time well make our decision
2047884 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation and there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation
2047885 there have also been 10 000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this worlds largest seizure and importation into our country
2047886 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2047887 villa are still in front for kaboul and they are also about to take shorey
2047888 i was interested in shorey so im disappointed but we are going to have to sell one or two to do something its not a bottomless pit after all
2047889 you need to sell really to bring someone in that is how it is and how it should be its not a problem the owner has been fantastic you cant criticise him realistically thats the way it is and theres nothing wrong in that
2047890 we have spent plenty of money and brought in a lot of good players the owner cannot keep doing that you cant expect it
2047891 we have to sell one or maybe two to bring someone else in and i accept that
2047892 we brought jermain defoe and lassana diarra in january the fans have never seen such good players at portsmouth weve got a good squad
2047893 the courts decision validates the arguments made by apollo group since the beginning of the case
2047894 after the illegal scheme was exposed by st in the summer of 2007 rather than siding with customers who had been victimized credit suisse group aligned itself with its wholly owned subsidiary credit suisse securities and its corrupt brokers and directors
2047895 gmastasquirrel you should feel lucky people think you are so young
2047896 the philippines welcomes the conclusion of the asean india fta free trade agreement
2047897 this important development augers well for the mutual progress of our two sides and will help intensify cooperation between these two dynamic regions of asia
2047898 one of the key lessons i think here is that the amount of information the sensitivity of the information the vulnerability of the information all are continuing to increase
2047899 war driving is simply driving around with a car with a laptop computer looking for accessible wireless networks
2047900 i was very stunned that they didnt use you know the proper security from point to point
2047901 asps are grouped into five subcategories enterprise asps deliver high end business applications local or regional asps supply wide variety of application services for smaller businesses in a local area specialist asps provide applications for a specific need such as web site services or human resources vertical market asps provide support to a specific industry volume business asps supply general small and medium sized businesses with pre packaged application services in volume
2047902 despite all the whirl we are going through corporate pakistan have not yet embraced it exceptions aside hence no effects can be seen on ground or in term of revenues in the account books
2047903 the generation at the helms of business affairs mostly family run thinks that what has been working for them in the past is good enough they hesitate to take new incentives into the untested area the strength of this social impulse reins back the widespread it employment in any area
2047904 because reliable internet connectivity is still a big issue here people would not like to shut their shops down only because they are unable to connect to the internet it services are very cheap in the third world as compared to the developed world and businesses still are not mature enough
2047905 when asps come in operation and results are noticed people will start buying asp solutions for automating manufacturing and marketing processes instead of costly software solutions businesses have to realize that it is like anything else they do on a subscription basis major thing any potential asp need is to build confidence and develop trust
2047906 like internet services providers isps we are so familiar with asps have to make applications available to multiple users at a time the more subscribers they will have the lower the lease rates will drop difficulty is that no one wants to take the initiative every one wants to see what others do and how which is why we are far behind in making innovative use of the technology available
2047907 we have already missed so many opportunities like business process outsourcing and back office operations in it sector we should not miss this one stakeholders should focus on measures to stay competitive necessary talent is there and many companies are doing a good job in individual capacity

2047910 we are still cautiously optimistic both for yield and quality
2047911 in the 21st century terrorists and criminals increasingly use laptops and other electronic media to transport illicit materials that were traditionally concealed in bags containers notebooks and paper documents
2047912 making full use of our search authorities with respect to items like notebooks and backpacks while failing to do so with respect to laptops and other devices would ensure that terrorists and criminals receive less scrutiny at our borders just as their use of technology is becoming more sophisticated
2047913 an all invasive approach that treats everyone like a suspect is not a smart trade off for the miniscule chance that well catch a break like that identifying a criminal
2047914 the costs of such a policy are high it gives terrorists a strong ideological advantage by portraying our country as oppressive and demagogic rather than free and open

2047933 though we play cover songs now and then that gets old after a while

2047948 the artistic community is just a microcosm of the city its hard to bring everybody together and to make people aware of what kind of things are going on around the city the community in the way that i see it is having people understand what is going on being connected in a way that you talk to a neighbour there is a sort of mutual awareness of other people that you live around what they do and what they create
2047949 unfortunately weve already filled your group and that concludes this short survey

2047966 the funds generated from the auction will be used to reduce delays and enhance capacity at new york area airports
2047967 dots auction proposal is unlawful unwise and will do absolutely nothing to reduce congestion and flight delays in new york
2047968 dots illegal approach fails to recognize the primary role of local airport proprietors in managing congestion at their airports and seeks unlawfully to usurp the proprietary right of the port authority of new york and new jersey to control how its facilities are used

2048016 acid rain is one of several pollution problems in asia that need solving in the coming decades but we need to appreciate the potential consequences of that clean up one of which could be an increase in methane emissions as the effect of the acid rain wears off
2048017 the reduction in pollution happens during a stage of the lifecycle when the rice plant is producing grain this period is normally associated with around half of all methane emissions from rice and we found that simulated acid rain pollution reduced this emission by 24 per cent
2048018 we need to do further research but it looks like there could be a combination of processes at work one line of investigation wed like to confirm is that the sulfate component of acid rain may actually boost rice yields
2048019 this might paradoxically have the effect of reducing a source of food for the methane producing micro organisms that live in the soil
2048020 there is also likely to be competition between these micro organisms and sulphate reducing bacteria normally in these conditions sulphate reducers win which results in less methane

2048086 whether its with a model or saying his life is in danger

2048122 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce even if it may appear to solve some difficulties for individuals has serious and lasting consequences on the common good of our society the experiences of other countries bear witness to this
2048123 we understand that in the kind of culture we are living in this means that one has to go against the current we hope that many will be those whose choice to give a contribution openly in favour of marriage and the family overcomes the choice to remain silent because of the fear of criticism
2048124 we will see mergers and acquisitions happening early in 2009
2048125 this then has a negative effect on new investment so i do not see these events contributing to a growth in online distribution
2048126 consumers are much more reluctant to pay directly online it is also a restricted market protecting local companies and this restricts the introduction of foreign advanced technologies or innovative foreign disruptive technology in the next few years the business2business environment will be firmly engaged in online distribution and procurement of product the most significant change will be in the way hotel product in china is distributed
2048127 the trouble that some travel companies and hotels find themselves in due to the slowdown will drive consolidation and alliances in the months to come which will have an impact on the sector
2048128 hopefully hotels will learn from the experience of the olympics not to rely on large scale events and inflated rates but to follow a path of smart distribution strategy through multiple channels and multiple markets more otas and online consolidators are entering as enabling technology becomes more accessible and cheaper for chinese hotels
2048129 the gds market will have to be regulated although i do not believe the government will relinquish complete control more likely they will announce further alliances with major international gds to provide new technology and further inventory for travelsky the chinese monopoly gds more airline consolidation is also expected in china as airlines lose money on rising fuel costs
2048130 i think we will see mergers and acquisitions happening early in 2009 i also believe that the chinese government will announce further relaxation of protective regulation in the sector to boost the industry post olympics
2048131 i grew up 10 minutes from the ground and i know what it means to the people of birmingham its a very passionate club
2048132 i think many of them arent happy that a club of this size is in the championship it belongs in the premier league
2048133 i want to get promoted and stabilise the club in the premier league that would be the sweetest moment for me
2048134 we are thrilled to welcome the mv agusta family of customers and employees into the harley davidson family of premium motorcycle brands
2048135 our primary focus with this acquisition is to grow our presence and enhance our position in europe as a leader in fulfilling customers dreams complementing the harley davidson and buell motorcycle families
2048136 its about the trains in brooklyn i took to get to and from rehab everyday the trains are basically metaphors that just happen to really exist thats what i thought was so amazing about the idea in crisis situations its human nature to find something else to focus on instead of letting the shame and guilt and depression just take over me i refocused on how i got to the point of needing to go to rehab while doing so i realized that my life in a way was a series of trains and the decisions i had made were like the stations i choose which paths to take and i choose which places to change my path like trains and stations i just happened to keep choosing the crappy ones
2048137 the financial world is very different in 2008 from the one that we started working with in the year 2000 so a change was necessary but it would be wrong to suggest that this is a reassurance campaign from halifax its just recognising that times have changed
2048138 the new bell brand underlines that we are moving forward as a company and as a service provider with new services a new strategy and a new goal
2048139 its a straightforward and customer focused brand that directly supports the bell teams goal to be recognized by customers as canadas leading communications company
2048140 the new bell brand is clear bold and instantly recognizable and the advertising that supports it tells our customers exactly what we can and will do for them
2048141 the taglines today just got better and la vie est bell reflect our commitment as a company and as a team to deliver on our strategy and achieve our goal
2048142 au milieu de nulle part avec un gps la vie est bell
2048143 la vie est bell just works naturally we found that substituting our logo directly for the french adjective belle in the tagline was an elegant and absolutely irresistible approach
2048144 the bell ements are a fun and constructive way to put the bell logo to work in every possible way all of our television ads actually take place on a gigantic bell logo while many of our print ads carry portions of the bell logo
2048145 considering that we offer the broadest range of services in canadian communications that so much of life happens on bells networks that canadian business runs on bell its only appropriate that our advertising literally takes place on bell too
2048146 we went with a team of the industrys best led by an elite trio of creative directors collaborating in a new and innovative client agency model
2048147 we think the teams work speaks for itself in terms of clarity emotional connection boldness and strong support for our strategy to deliver a better customer experience
2048148 we believe that the company is now positioned to return to consistent quarterly operating profitability
2048149 this product is quite versatile well built and simple to work with
2048150 the folks at 360 vision even had each rep build and assemble a dome from scratch during a recent training session each component literally clipped in and fit just like building blocks converting an analog camera to ip was as simple as changing a couple of components inside the camera assembly

2048153 i dont think you should ever turn your back on any scientific hypothesis because youre afraid of what it might show if you know that susceptible group you can save those children if you turn your back on the notion there is a susceptible group what can i say
2048154 there is a completely expressed concern that they dont want to pursue a hypothesis because that hypothesis could be damaging to the public health community at large by scaring people
2048155 i think the publics smarter than that the public values vaccines but more importantly i dont think you should ever turn your back on any scientific hypothesis because youre afraid of what it might show
2048156 what were seeing in the bulk of the population vaccines are safe
2048157 but there may be this susceptible group the fact that there is concern that you dont want to know that susceptible group is a real disappointment to me
2048158 t here is a completely expressed concern that they dont want to pursue a hypothesis because that hypothesis could be damaging to the public health community at large by scaring people
2048159 also commendable is the new 5 year research plan of the national vaccine advisory committee which will entail the study of minority subpopulations including patients with mitochondrial disorders
2048160 ignorant of the recent history in the very subject she was discussing

2048163 if one believes that international trade is a major contributor to the prosperity of the advanced industrial countries one must also believe that trade is responsible for some of the social and distributional costs that trades opponents have charged it with
2048164 it is true that roma are interested in yossi i was talking with him yesterday and told him i want to keep him
2048165 he is a player with quality and has shown that during pre season i have no more news about yossi he will be staying with us
2048166 i also talked with dirk kuyt this morning i am really pleased with him and he will also be staying with us
2048167 my films are only as good as decisions i made at that point of time
2048168 films are about decisions time and quality are not inter related i am teeming with so many ideas not necessarily good they may be good bad or ugly but i am in a rush to make films i wrote shiva in 20 minutes and satya never had the script
2048169 either you can endlessly discuss an idea and the story can go in hundred different ways or you take a decision based on your temperament one fine day i decided to give up my engineering and started a video library and then i gave it up and became a director and then i packed my bags and came to bombay thats my temperament
2048170 if i take all these things into consideration i cannot make a film filmmaking for me is like having a conversation it depends on my mood while making contract i might have thought let me make a rambo in a realistic setting it may not have been a good enough idea to begin with but thats me
2048171 the audience is not an animal that you can study its behaviour and characteristics and then feed it i do various kinds of things its my personality that comes across my films
2048172 i am able to afford it if i need 40 lakh people to recover money for sarkar raj lets say i need only two lakh people to watch contract if i have to see if they like it or not i wouldnt have had made any movies
2048173 what went wrong with aag is there was a multiplicity of objectives
2048174 with regard to ek pal ki i liked the song very much but nobody had heard that song i only used it again with intention of popularising it similarly govinda govinda is a track from a telugu film its not because i dont have an idea but its because i think its an idea that didnt realise its potential so i keep on remaking everything
2048175 maybe the day i gave an interview i felt like it but today i dont tomorrow i may feel like remaking it i think i can make a masala film really well but in aag what went wrong was there was a multiplicity of objectives if i want to make a masala film i can really make it
2048176 i think it is fantastic blogging is helping me in two ways for the first time i have one place where i can put across what i feel without the fear of it being distorted more important than that i am getting feedback from people who have no fear of me or not be obligated to be loyal thats helping me a lot
2048177 in fact i changed that approach when i was very new to the internet i was not net savvy at all but today i realise why should i give specific importance to khalid i read a review of sarkar raj on a site called passionforcinema i was thrilled that somebody could hate me so much and i mean it it takes a great deal to hate someone so much it was incredible there were so many things that were far more bitchier than people who are employed to do criticise as a filmmaker i am collecting thoughts
2048178 thats what they were doing if they are talking about me as a person i would like to know about that persons background
2048179 i stopped watching films after i started video library it wasnt for education a video library guy will never watch films like a bar owner will never drink
2048180 i would say yes and no my first film shiva was pretty much derived from my personal experiences from the college atmosphere to characters but my taking style has been derived from cinema every film has a scene ive taken from another movie
2048181 even when i saw his recent movies like grindhouse thats pretty much what i like i can be as mad as that too
2048182 i saw this incredible visual the other day it was dark and i was going for a walk and i saw a ghostly kind of an image late in the evening about 12 15 couples scattered around the stretch in almost identical poses holding each other i didnt understand and then suddenly i realised it was parting time so though they were different people they were doing the same thing now ive explained this shot to you because we are talking face to face
2048183 now aag the whole country knew how horrible it was but the 100 people working on the film were taken in by what i told them i psyched them with my vision i couldnt do that to the whole country a lot of times i take it for granted that my thought process will come through when i start making the film what is in my head does not translate and come out the same way i had a rogue friend who used to wear dirty chappals who liked this really good looking girl one day he came in nike shoes because he wanted to impress her and suddenly one day he choked and said she deserves someone better the emotion with which he said it served as the benchmark and nike shoes became the yellow shirt munnabhai wears in rangeela i think in a rush on the basis of the first excitement i make a decision to make a film it is the same wackiness and eccentricity that is also responsible for whatever good work i may have done in the last 20 years
2048184 i always wake up in the morning with an idea not necessarily a good one i am always eager to wake up with a new idea i have a ball all the time its a myth that i am callous but i am very intense i made it with a lot of seriousness in fact i had never been more serious all my life like when i made aag i was not careless i seriously did the wrong thing
2048185 love and hate take equal amount of effort and energy that its not worth it love is a self induced drug to feel high you like the feeling of being in love more than the person you are in love with so your imagination takes over when you are courting and in your mind you put your best foot forward you say the best lines all the time when you get married your true colours come out what happens is the picture you imagined your head is no longer there and love starts disappearing the greatest romantic visual i see is in mumbai its around noon its a dirty beach with and rocks and dirt all around its ugly but the feel of lovers sitting together in that hot sun is so strong that for me it is far more a greater visual than an exotic song in switzerland
2048186 i oppose drilling for new oil because we need to end our dependence on foreign energy supplies
2048187 putting more air in your cars tires will solve the entire problem
2048188 china is producing eight times the number of engineers then we are
2048189 exxons profit margin stood at 10 for 2007 which is hardly out of line with the oil and gas industry average of 8 3 or the 8 9 for u s manufacturing excluding the sputtering auto makers

2048193 we are very pleased to have secured someone of denes calibre to take on this new position and join the team of specialist coaches
2048194 dene will work closely with england assistant coach andy flower and be responsible for coaching players selected for the england lions and england performance programme squads as well as implementing a development programme for our best young batsmen within age group teams
2048195 we are excited to see developing opportunities in the haynesville shale gas play right in our backyard of north louisiana and east texas
2048196 it is vitally important that people know the value and benefits of this officeholder so while the information commissioner will be totally independent of the foi unit we are spearheading the nomination and public education campaign to promote residents understanding
2048197 we all must know that this is the person who will be guarding our foi rights i cannot overstate the importance of getting involved in choosing the information commissioner
2048198 staff is engaging in the refinement of staff recommendations and there are ongoing discussions with stakeholders to remove areas of conflict or at a minimum better define the areas of real conflict
2048199 strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life
2048200 only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty
2048201 every effort should be made to exclude the use of fire arms especially against children
2048202 in the current global climate of difficult economic conditions and the ongoing effects of the credit crunch businesses are keen to reduce their overheads wherever possible
2048203 by considering and implementing methods of reducing their energy costs many businesses in northern ireland can achieve this and improve their bottom line while minimising their impact on the environment
2048204 we can get anywhere from 8 to 10 bags of trash off of this river theres a lot of use on this river a lot of people are using this river
2048205 we had a meeting with a couple of dnr officers and we did not go through the proper steps of getting the permits they were aware of what we would like to do to help clean our river but were not on the same page i guess
2048206 i believe the group had good intentions but you know no group no matter how good their intentions are can do something without permission on state property
2048207 there is an administrative rule that prohibits anyone from operating a commercial business on dnr state property
2048208 because they were collecting deposit cans there was some commercial use implications
2048209 so far weve used a little bit of the money to repay back some of the bills weve had from the construction of the booths
2048210 the money isnt going into the pocket of anybody who wants to come up here to help clean the river
2048211 theyre thinking about what little they take down but that little bit and the little bit that everyone else takes down adds up and i dont think theyre aware of how much trash is being left in the river
2048212 the muslim world does look at obama as a muslim
2048213 al qaida wants obama to be president the terrorist organizations around the world want obama to be president
2048214 maya soetoro ng when asked if her mother was an atheist said
2048215 jesus she felt was a wonderful example but she felt that a lot of christians behaved in un christian ways
2048216 i was not raised in a religious household my mothers own experiences only reinforced this inherited skepticism
2048217 surely for your lifeblood i will demand a reckoning from the hand of every beast i will require it and from the hand of man
2048218 whoever sheds mans blood by man his blood shall be shed for in the image of god he made man
2048219 if the thief is found breaking in and he is struck so that he dies there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed
2048220 if the sun has risen on him if he is found out or was identified and arrested there shall be guilt for his bloodshed he should make full restitution if he has nothing then he shall be sold for his theft if the theft is found alive in his hand whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep he shall restore double
2048221 do not be afraid of them remember the lord great and awesome and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your houses
2048222 you disgust me you sit there licking your lips about the death of another human being you sicken me you people are dragging us back into the caves
2048223 well see what the audience thinks of the character and well take it from there
2048224 commitment to pre marriage dna testing for the expected couple
2048225 as a result of the risks of hereditary diseases the safe motherhood project adopted health in parliament in cooperation with the ministry of health tried to oblige both people in the expected couple to get premarital tests before making the marriage contract to ensure they are disease free
2048226 as some members objected some terms in the law that contain sanctions
2048227 if the tests prove the couple carries a hereditary disease they shouldnt get married to each other as the risk of potential infection will be more than 50 percent
2048228 when you learn that half of the 9 11 hijackers were registered to vote thats when you realize that the honor system the country has for its voter registration system is broken
2048229 when i saw him my first reaction was quick hurry get a rope before he loses grip and ends up far down the river
2048230 thats very heroic but he could have been hurt himself i wish hed waited i guess its a long time to wait when youre child is involved
2048231 stop playing in the bayou and stop playing in the ditch if i wouldnt have been there to hear his cry and save him it wouldnt have been pretty
2048232 we have so many issues to fight right here at home we dont need to make war on iran
2048233 tomorrow morning we are going to confront the racist border watch at a job site and we urge you to join us
2048234 enough is enough in our name with our money they are killing people across the world we waged war in iraq more than a million innocent men women and children have died
2048235 peoples lives are in a crisis with the rising gas prices rising rents and food costs people are sick of war and want our tax money to be spent on the real needs of the people
2048236 we support war resisters theyre our brothers theyre our sisters
2048237 reading howard zinns peoples history of the united states opened my eyes to the reality of what armed forces recruitment was really about
2048238 his life was impeccable he was such an example to those who knew him
2048239 if you would ask him a question his response would always be do the right thing
2048240 over the last few days i began to realize the hand that may not be there physically but it is still there through the lessons my dad taught me throughout my life
2048241 he helped so many people that no one except people the people he helped knew about
2048242 he was a true public servant who knew what service meant
2048243 i was never more proud as he walked down the hallway one last time
2048244 the negotiations have only one subject the name and the wider application of the name
2048245 we would do that in order to minimize potential layoffs
2048246 if layoffs are required management will first look at laying off members of the union that did not agree to this memorandum on furloughs
2048247 thats tough on anyone it doesnt matter who you are
2048248 ziel ist es bei steigendem verkehrsaufkommen den verkehrsfluss zu optimieren und staus zu verringern ja sogar zu vermeiden und damit letztlich die verkehrssicherheit insgesamt zu erh hen
2048249 dieses vorhaben passt genau zu unserem konzept f r ein staufreies hessen zwar nutzen wir f r unsere pilotprojekte zur intelligenten steuerung von verkehrsstr men schon jetzt frequenzen die uns die bundesnetzagentur problemlos zur verf gung stellt die festlegung der kommission auf einheitliche frequenzen f r die gesamte eu erleichtert jedoch die europaweite zusammenarbeit damit ist die voraussetzung f r die schnelle und unkomplizierte verbreitung der neuen staufrei technologien geschaffen zugleich ist diese entscheidung ein deutliches zeichen der eu im interkontinentalen vergleich mit japan oder amerika wo derartige voraussetzungen bereits gegeben sind
2048250 wir bieten sozusagen das richtige pflaster f r innovationen denn neue verkehrstechnologien die den test auf autobahnen im rhein main gebiet bestehen sind reif f r die vermarktung und den export weit ber deutschlands grenzen hinaus
2048251 der erste schritt erfolgt in hessen langfristig haben wir jedoch die absicht mit diesem system in ganz deutschland und europa erfolgreich zu sein
2048252 ein nicht unwichtiger nebeneffekt der diamant technik wird sein dass als folge des optimierten verkehrsflusses auch der kraftstoffverbrauch und damit die emissionen gesenkt werden
2048253 das wachsende verkehrsaufkommen in ballungsr umen kann in zukunft nur noch ber vollautomatische netzbeeinflussungsanlagen gesteuert werden software intelligenz beim verkehrsmanagement ist entscheidend aus der car to infrastructure kommunikation resultieren hochwertige verkehrsdaten die die effizienz von elektronischen verkehrsleitsystemen noch einmal deutlich verbessern k nnen
2048254 wir m ssen davon ausgehen dass sowohl der individualverkehr als auch der g tertransport auf dem deutschen stra ennetz weiter zunehmen werden
2048255 in unserer kooperation entwickeln wir zukunftsweisende systeme f r optimales verkehrsmanagement vernetzung der verkehrstr ger und intelligente leit und informationstechnologien mit dem ziel die individuelle mobilit t als grundbed rfnis der menschen zu sichern

2048260 to me personally i understand how it could be offensive to some people but i had ancestors who fought in the confederate army and i thought they fought honorably
2048261 the confederate flag is offensive in many many ways as we all know its a symbol of racism and slavery
2048262 it is exciting to be here and to have so many people gathered here on the platform celebrating the rich heritage of our railways and of paekakariki a true railway town
2048263 that bass would go in the rock and roll hall of fame some day if we could find it

2048265 our socketmodem hsdpa models are complete and approved modems so they can be implemented in designs to reduce a products time to market the socketmodem hsdpa is yet another member of our family of embedded solutions that create communication ready devices by integrating connectivity into a single universal socket design
2048266 global aviation is making a painful adjustment to the new reality of 100 plus oil cathay pacific is reducing other costs where it can but there is a limit to how much cost can be saved before quality and brand are compromised it is thus inevitable that fares for passengers and shippers will have to rise to reflect the new cost of operation
2048267 the companys priority at this time is to protect the integrity of this network there will be some redeployment of capacity within the network but it is not envisaged that the company will withdraw from any destination it now serves
2048268 i couldnt be more excited to begin my second tenure with hockey night in canada

2048270 right of the lebanese people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kfarshouba highlands and the lebanese section of ghajar as well as to defend lebanon by all legal means
2048271 this was mainly about saving face and may help these figures in the upcoming elections but it was largely symbolic
2048272 i think the current ministerial statement reflects the balance of power on the ground that was made clear after may
2048273 no side is going to be willing to press hard on the issue of hizbullahs arms
2048274 there has been no reconciliation at the grassroots level but then previous agreements have had no more popular support
2048275 people have developed the skill of walking through a minefield
2048276 just when i thought i was out they pull me back in
2048277 a unified regulatory framework to govern the global financial system
2048278 confusing mix of diffused accountability regulatory competition and a complex web of rules that create perverse incentives and leave huge opportunities for arbitrage and evasion
2048279 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country
2048280 i need to send the message as an athlete from sudan im worried about the kids who are dying in darfur
2048281 im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics as i was watching the sydney olympics

2048286 im very honored to be here and im very honored to lead the u s team into the stadium tonight im very excited
2048287 this woman is shepherding a group of officers and enlisted men to their deaths
2048288 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
2048289 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
2048290 children here are butterflies they come in one way and transform into somebody else the transformation if people can understand that being one on one with a child here means the world to them
2048291 the victim has lacerations to her face and body and she was conscious and alert at the time she was transported to the hospital and admitted
2048292 when the officers arrived they realized it was the same victim that had been beaten and robbed and sexually assaulted a few days ago on marble street
2048293 it very well could fit a domestic violence profile based on the fact we believe the suspect is an estranged boyfriend that had previously resided with the victim
2048294 the initiative seeks to provide treatments and solutions to ensure the state of equality justice and freedom development and consolidation of democratic values
2048295 such dangerous phenomena in yemen are a result of deep imbalances that the state must face and find solutions to even if such task are difficult and harsh

2048299 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2048300 guess how secure that is in the face of a dns attack
2048301 ssls not the panacea we would like it to be
2048302 i do not want to see my cell phone bill this month
2048303 the entire scope of the attack is even yet to be fully realised
2048304 the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid 2008 which in part was expected
2048305 we are identifying downside risks since a number of months and i would say that the information that we had very clearly suggests the materialization of those risks
2048306 the main development over the past month seems to be that the ecb is more downbeat about the euro zones current growth situation and the outlook
2048307 unchanged interest rates seem highly likely in the near term at least as mr trichet indicated that the ecb continues to hold a neutral stance
2048308 this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
2048309 we have one needle in our compass and we take absolutely all the information that is pertinent to identify the risks for inflation in the months and years to come
2048310 the peak of the price of oil and commodities was very abnormal and not corresponding to equilibrium in price but we will see what happens
2048311 volatile captures pretty well the evolution that we have seen in the most recent period
2048312 risks to price stability remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months
2048313 they didnt get them to come to the front door so they went around to the rear of the building and they kicked the door in
2048314 his brother who works with javier arrived at the location the in the morning so they could start their days work
2048315 he heard his mother screaming he went in the house and found that she had been bound and tied up and found the body of his brother
2048316 i dont know why all he cared for was to work and have everything for his daughters
2048317 we are looking at the home front experience here not from the perspective of the soldiers but from the other people that were left behind the mothers the fathers the children so the people who were working in the ship yard the people building the liberty ships people who made their own victory gardens and producing their own food
2048318 with andrea pininfarina i have lost a great friend and outstanding business partner
2048319 he was a man of great humanity and in this moment of deep sorrow my heart goes out to his parents his wife children brothers and all his collaborators at pininfarina
2048320 youre not a racing driver youre a f ing idiot
2048321 we really get all of the sickest babies in the state and we stay pretty full
2048322 about one in four premature babies will have some kind of life long disability
2048323 women who dont have insurance many times do not avail themselves to pre natal care
2048324 if they get care the incidences of pre term deliveries you know pre maturity is lower
2048325 it seems the filmmakers have crafted this movie entirely to my tastes how is this possible
2048326 the numbers on the graph reflect how many searches have been done for a particular term relative to the total number of searches done on google over time they dont represent absolute search volume numbers because the data is normalized and presented on a scale from 0 100 each point on the graph is divided by the highest point or 100
2048327 that range from a copy of the book to q amp a
2048328 we are so grateful to radio forth for doing this and it all came together quite quickly and easily after the article in the evening news
2048329 people in the community have really rallied round and supported us and that has really surprised kris and i
2048330 having this money takes the pressure off a bit as we didnt know how much we would raise on the day but any money we do raise now could go to a mixture of charities
2048331 the story about kai and luke really touched our hearts and radio forths cash for kids is glad to be able to help with a grant for the memorial climbing frame
2048332 what do they always have to write about that stuff for
2048333 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story
2048334 we are confident that over the course of this process even more facts will come to light and justice will be served
2048335 she has made many threats on my life and job she called my job up to six times attempting to slander my name and have me fired
2048336 she has been spotted in front of my home on several occasions she has contacted all of my family and friends attempting to make threats and slander my name she has also contacted my current girlfriend and i feel she is in jeopardy as well
2048337 until he is apprehended he continues to pose a threat not only to other potential buildings and property but also to the property and safety of friends and family members as well the reason for this is that under the right set of circumstances it is possible he could strike out unpredictably against someone he knows
2048338 he may make comments or offer reasons why he believes the fires were started such as what do they expect
2048339 weve got a wonderful town and a wonderful county but weve got sick people out there
2048340 i am concerned for the dogs because they really do need extra care
2048341 you never wanted me you used me to get to my sister
2048342 we were afraid that they would try and introduce big increases without saying anything about them and thats whats happened in this case
2048343 researchers noticed years ago that hiv infection rarely occurred in them
2048344 one hypothesis is that they mount an immune response that protected them
2048345 just having the chance to play meet the guys and talk to them was outstanding last season
2048346 it was a great experience to see what the nhl was all about and now that i know what to expect ill prepare for it ill work hard at training camp because i know how fun it is to be an nhl hockey player even though i only spent a week with the team it was the best time of my life i really want to try to make the team and stick with them the whole year right out of camp
2048347 being such a young guy i didnt know what to think of the trade at first
2048348 i wasnt really sure if it was a good or bad thing but florida welcomed me with open arms and its been absolutely great to be a part of this organization so i think its worked out for the best
2048349 i started working out in private gyms strictly for hockey
2048350 i got into much better shape and began working a lot with the coaches at belleville coach george burnett and assistant jake grimes did a great job in my four years with the team jake showed me all the tricks on how to become a better player and better offensive threat
2048351 grimes was a former forward for belleville from 1989 to 1992 and was drafted so i listened to every word
2048352 he just showed me how to use my big body by driving to the net and cutting into the lanes to get opportunities ill be working with him again in preparation for camp he knows what its like to be a pro
2048353 you want to be a plus player to show that youre not being scored on
2048354 early on i was a second tier player matched up against top guys on the other team and i just didnt have the numbers against them but ive become a plus player on the top line the last two seasons i enjoy going up against the top players because it obviously brings out the best in you even though it makes the game a little bit harder it will help you become a better player in the long run
2048355 we feel shawn will make an impact in florida in the near future
2048356 hes been very successful in junior hockey and is now ready to take the next step to professional hockey he is a high character individual who fits perfectly into what we look for in a panthers player
2048357 i played wing a lot at belleville and received plenty of help in learning the position
2048358 its obviously a new element and its just a matter of getting comfortable it definitely helped broaden my game because by playing wing i learned how to make those quick adjustments by getting the puck off the boards being able to retrieve the puck from the defenseman and chip it out or make a play at center ice are all critical to playing wing playing the position is something i still need to work at but feel im learning more every day
2048359 we are now seeing crown rust on grassland as far north as yorkshire
2048360 even at low infection levels the characteristic orange spores on the leaves depress intakes and nutritional quality of grass
2048361 research at niab has shown that a one point reduction in d value equates to a 5 decrease in animal performance so even low level crown rust infections are costly in more extreme cases crown rust will cause long term damage to swards and accelerate the need for reseeding
2048362 there is significant variation in the resistance of different ryegrass varieties to crown rust but most aber ryegrasses score favourably due to a the long term breeding strategy at iger now ibers
2048363 inclusion of clover will also reduce the swards overall susceptibility to crown rust
2048364 the novelty of stereo has worn off record buyers are tired of hearing music jump back and forth between speakers realism not ping pong sound is the new goal
2048365 its like being all over the place at once till now we were satisfied if we could make the listener feel he was hearing the music from the best seat in the house now with the new multichannel methods we can do better than that no seat in the house gets as much of whats going on musically as does a multi mike pickup thats like having extra ears everywhere
2048366 with the price of fuel spiralling ever higher many businesses are starting to feel the pinch as overheads continue to soar
2048367 the manufacturing sector saw a 39 rise in july 2008 compared to july 2007 which comes as no great shock following recent figures on manufacturing output which decreased by 0 8 in the second quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter
2048368 there is a temptation not to spend money on checks of new customers and suppliers
2048369 but the fact is that rigorous credit checks supported by ongoing monitoring of customers and suppliers financial status are key to help businesses of all sizes protect their cash flow and avoid bad debt
2048370 seeks to reward a person who has entered into a plea agreement and is cooperating with law enforcement authorities or whose cooperation is beneficial to the administration of criminal justice
2048371 may admit as evidence on the part of the prosecutor any statements documents writings and other articles tendered to the court in the absence of the witness
2048372 two purposes can be fulfilled by paper committal using written statements instead of oral testimony alone these statements may be employed as a means of making the committal procedure more efficient and for the witness need to attend and recite his evidence is obviated and the courts time is saved
2048373 use of written statements can remove from the court the task of examining the sufficiency of the evidence and thus create a mechanism which in effect replaces the committal hearing
2048374 owing to practical difficulties procedural requirements lack of adequate time and heavy volume of work in courts frequent adjournments and various other compelling reasons there has been a considerable delay and arrears in courts needing urgent attention of the government
2048375 make available less expensive and speedy justice to the common man

2048377 a location email address telephone number or other number or designation used for the purpose of identifying telecommunications systems or apparatus
2048378 it has been observed that mobile cellular phones are frequently used to facilitate planning and commission of serious crimes also there has been a spate of thefts of mobile devices by unscrupulous persons in order to track these sources in the investigation by the police the identification of the persons in possession of the cellular devices is very vital
2048379 the problems included the communication between with those who were in charge of the operation and the need for improvisation the place where the briefcase was supposed to be handed over to the head of the gang was constantly being changed the haul comprised of bills of exchange and a notebook was not in the agents briefcase when the murderer discovered this a conflict ensued
2048380 this was the most tragic police operation in slovak history
2048381 i dont want to hand out any red cards today this is a day of mourning
2048382 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2048383 this substantial investment will allow health boards to put in place a range of new and improved health facilities to serve people in communities right across scotland above all it shows that this government is strongly committed to improving dental services particularly in areas where registration rates are currently unacceptably low
2048384 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2048385 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2048386 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2048387 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2048388 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2048389 raymond is so nonpolitical he didnt even realize it it all comes down to one letter in a name it would have been a natural mistake for him to have made
2048390 i would say its a lot like x men although theres some matrix as well
2048391 the pusher has the ability to alter your mind and change your thinking or certainly predict what youre about to do in the near future without you even knowing ahead of time
2048392 its kind of in the vein of that show heroes
2048393 its a group of individuals who have certain powers theyre either on the run or in hiding from this branch of the government called division that wants to capture these people and get their power for warfare
2048394 i play the character of a government agent who is the head of division
2048395 my character has powers also and is a pusher as well and so i hunt these people down and enhance their abilities to see the future whatever it is and i want to turn all of them into real soldiers
2048396 i think the rights of farmers have been taken away
2048397 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other
2048398 for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2048399 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black
2048400 i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be
2048401 and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2048402 nicky is a quality natural left back who played for england 18 months ago
2048403 obviously the injury to wilfred has left a gaping hole on the left side freddie had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
2048404 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
2048405 yes but then the british came and taught us shame
2048406 im just so proud of all these men and women
2048407 pe mine m a sunat un prieten care anul trecut era la polul nord intr o expeditie norvegiana si mi a zis ca acolo sunt plus 5 grade si se vede pamant
2048408 sunt cateva semnale de alarma care au fost deja trase si lumea tinde sa le ignore
2048409 in anul 2000 am fost sa vizitez angkor templele tribului khmer din zona siam rip in cambodgia doar 50 din 5 000 de temple pot fi vizitate din cauza minelor din jungla care pot exploda oricand
2048410 poti ajunge acolo doar cu motocicleta toti localnicii au o motocicleta si sunt dispusi sa te ghideze spre temple cand am mers eu acolo locul era inca destul de izolat dar localnicii povesteau ca urmeaza sa vina mai multi investitori in zona si sa creasca numarul zborurilor spre siam rip si se va construi si un monorail pe deasupra junglei prin urmare lucrurile or sa se schimbe foarte mult in rau din pacate
2048411 am fost de 6 ori la machu picchu si de fiecare data am vazut schimbari majore daca in 1996 arata asa cum fusese redescoperit de arheologul bingham in anul 1911 ultima oara cand am fost acolo in urma cu doi ani incepusera sa inlocuiasca vechile ruine
2048412 am fost sfatuit de un localnic sa privesc rasaritul de pe varful uneia dintre piramidele cetatii la 5 dimineata priveam cum urcau aburi din jungla care ma inconjura din toate partile e ceva unic
2048413 am fost acolo in 1994 cand iordania facuse pace cu israelul si si deschisese granitele vizitatorilor atunci oamenii se puteau catara pe unde doreau si acolo au fost realizate filme precum indiana jones si mortal kombat cu atatia vizitatori e posibil sa se naruiasca in timp
2048414 un loc care trebuie vizitat este si solar de uyuni daca iei un tablou de dali si l transformi in realitate asa arata si solar orasul este un desert imens de sare care era acum cateva mii de ani mare dar a secat lasand in urma doar 10 000 de km patrati de sare iar cand soarele apune si rasare desertul isi schimba culoarea ca un fel de aureola boreala proiectata pe pamant
2048415 ca sa ajungi in desert trebuie sa mergi totusi multe ore pana in uyuni la marginea desertului cu un autobuz local plin de gaini si tarani si trebuie sa ai multe haine groase la tine pentru ca e foarte frig locul se afla la o altitudine de 4 000 de metri deasupra nivelului marii mai exista si varianta unui tren dar care cred merge doar o data pe saptamana acolo e cel mai minunat loc pe care l am vazut vreodata
2048416 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
2048417 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
2048418 we wanted to have a mechanism where a common person can get a sim card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met
2048419 various problems on sim cards have been identified we want to deal with them
2048420 to equate the course of religious discussion in america with anything that could even resemble religious persecution in china or imply that the former could become the latter is the height of vanity and trivializes the true suffering of an embattled people
2048421 the balance of evidence suggests a human effect on climate
2048422 the body of statistical evidence in chapter 8 when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system now points to a discernable human influence on global climate
2048423 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidenced that we can attribute the observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases
2048424 john mccain used to think it was more important to be right than president he seems to have reversed that completely in 2008
2048425 over time we must shift our entire energy economy toward a sustainable mix of new and cleaner power sources this will include some we use already such as wind solar biofuels and other sources yet to be invented it will include a variety of new automotive and fuel technologies clean burning coal and nuclear energy and a new system of incentives under a cap and trade policy to put the power of the market on the side of environmental protection

2048431 it was amazing as soon as nils saw the norwegians he moved away from all the other king penguins over to the gate and stood up to his full regal height he clearly recognised them and they all went over to greet him he was a bit upset when they left but im sure hell be very pleased next week
2048432 the details of the ceremony are being kept a closely guarded secret but the guards who visited nils were all very pleased to meet him he seemed to recognise who they were
2048433 this is a major event and the last time nils got a promotion it made headlines around the world
2048434 we are very excited to welcome the norwegian royal guard back and we are very proud of our connection with them its always a great occasion and the staff are really looking forward to it the guard came in for a quick visit today and nils olav recognised them instantly so i suspect he knows that a promotion may be imminent
2048435 i think we have to sit down and lay out the details of our options and get started
2048436 i think at this point youve got to take the issues one at a time because you cant sit back and wait for something that may never happen
2048437 but if it does as long as you havent started building i suppose you could always reconsider
2048438 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2048439 from the prequel i am not working on but that was fun
2048440 if you believe that america is too smug too self satisfied too rich then lets destroy america it is not that hard to do
2048441 i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture
2048442 lastly i would censor victor hanson daviss book mexifornia his book is dangerous it exposes the plan to destroy america if you feel america deserves to be destroyed dont read that book
2048443 chumblor and all those who join him in a world view that says nothing is better than any other thing

2048448 the critical element in any over molding process is the chemical bond between the soft elastomeric material and the rigid substrate
2048449 the materials are also particularly well suited for rugged electronic devices with over molded designs where excellent tensile and tear strength as well as abrasion resistance are required
2048450 di kediaman rasulullah kami dahulu menyusun ayat ayat al quran yang tercatat pada riqa
2048451 letakkanlah ayat ini dalam surah yang menyebutkan begini atau begitu
2048452 namun hampir tidak bisa ditemukan berbagai riwayat yang mengatakan bahwa ayat sekian ditempatkan setelah ayat ini dan sebagainya sekiranya ada maka al quran akan membutuhkan sekian ribu riwayat nabi atau sahabat tentang susunan al quran mengingat ayat ayat tersebut diturunkan secara terpisah selama 23 tahun karya karya sedetail al burhan dan al itqan juga tidak menulis riwayat riwayat tersebut
2048453 bahwa urutan surah surah al quran disusun atas dasar ijtihad mereka para sahabat nabi sendiri
2048454 semasa hidup rasulullah banyak surah telah diketahui susunan dan urutannya sehingga susunan berdasar kehendak dan petunjuk rasulullah jauh lebih besar dan yang berdasarkan ijtihad amat sedikit
2048455 my concern is that by adopting this class rank chart youre basically telling children that take average level classes that they can never be in the top 50
2048456 we should give every child the opportunity to succeed if youre properly leveled by the administration and youre pushing yourself then you should be rewarded
2048457 there was no chart anywhere in the region that could satisfy everyones wants fairly
2048458 my kids are right in the middle and the gaps are getting bigger for them
2048459 i turned down the academy program for my younger son i want a well rounded kid not a kid stressed with all honors
2048460 if an abusive gangmaster thinks he can simply set up shop under a different name with someone to front the operation up who is no more than a puppet he needs to think again
2048461 the biggest problem is with sub contracting when gangmasters employ other gangmasters this has the highest risk where the end user does not know who is employed by whom
2048462 there are many reputable businesses in this sector but unfortunately there are some who exploit these vulnerable workers
2048463 the nice thing was it was just good to be able to spend a bit of time with jack because hes a wonderful very english man being out there with him on the track it didnt take long before his eyes were back into seeing the racing line and he was making little adjustments each lap it was great to see i hope i still have that passion and enthusiasm for driving cars quickly when im 78
2048464 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2048465 i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black
2048466 when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2048467 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core
2048468 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
2048469 no one can touch me no ones mine im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing
2048470 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life
2048471 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2048472 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2048473 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
2048474 the events of the latter days only continue to cast doubts on whether the country that proclaims itself as a peacemaker can carry out such mission
2048475 woods hole is well known as a filmmaker friendly festival
2048476 was to sit down and talk with not only the audience but the people who actually selected our film for the festival
2048477 heidi and i saw a dribbles poster featuring emotional comments from two festival selection committee members
2048478 we found out that of the two people who confessed to being choked up and teary eyed by our film one directed a number of stunt action scenes in the original terminator movie and the other was the writer director of the horror film the legend of lucy keyes
2048479 we are very thankful that people viewed our film with open minds and open hearts
2048480 all lenders who use experian have to get the most updated version of the fico score
2048481 why doesn t every bank just request to be put on the latest release
2048482 why wont fair isaac or the credit bureaus make the banks to update it

2048484 lovely see the cloud the cloud appear lovely see the rain the rain draw near who spoke it was the little corn ear high on the tip of the stalk
2048485 i still dont know whether i will continue at real madrid its not defined yet
2048486 the season is just starting and ive been given some offers from other clubs i have one from chelsea but nothing has been sorted out yet we are just talking
2048487 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
2048488 it is fair to say that that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
2048489 we assure you no buses were injured in this ad
2048490 for some people it brings back the reality of such a tragedy but the liberal left doesnt care about people or people who were killed or people who lost family or friends in a bus accident
2048491 87 of fox news viewers are going to vote for mccain
2048492 republican john mccain called thursday for a federal investigation into plans by the dhl shipping company that could cost 10 000 jobs here as he and his campaign manager took criticism for helping dhl complete a merger in 2003 that led to its current plans
2048493 in reality people have lost loved ones in iraq and everyday they get reminded of it becasue of the likes of you wanting to continue it but the conservative right doesnt care about people or people who were killed or people who lost family or friends in iraq
2048494 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
2048495 wars may be fought with weapons but they are won by men it is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory
2048496 angry believes something is true just because he swaps the words around but its obvious that military loathe what the left is doing
2048497 fine okay just take this will this make you happy
2048498 even if it gets back down to three dollars a gallon i still think its incumbent on all the elected officials to to do what they can to conserve fuel
2048499 those five departments are the largest users of fuel and represent 90 percent of the county for fuel
2048500 the request to cut our usage is difficult for us
2048501 we budgeted for some increase but certainly not as much as its gone up so far
2048502 if you go to trial you will be convicted of all counts of the indictment i see no plausible defense which can be mounted to neutralize the governments overwhelming case everything the informants will testify to is supported by audio and video tapes co defendants testimony and your own admissions
2048503 i was advised the governments plea offer is the outcome of a consensus of several agencies including the muskingum county sheriffs office the u s attorneys office the fbi and others i was assured the offer will not get any better only worse
2048504 i do not see any possibility of you prevailing at trial
2048505 as i told you in my opinion all the trial would be is a slow guilty plea
2048506 all my heart and soul i am giving you the true benefit of my experience as well as my research and evaluation of your case
2048507 frankly at a loss because we have no viable theory of defense
2048508 you must recognize that your decision to not consider this plea agreement is completely against my advice
2048509 the crisis in tibet demands serious and urgent attention president sarkozy should not now retreat from what was promising french leadership on an issue of international concern at this time a meeting between sarkozy and the dalai lama is less important than an indication from the elysee palace of its serious intention to help move negotiations between the chinese and tibetans forward to a successful conclusion
2048510 the presence of president sarkozys wife carla bruni sarkozy at a ceremony with the dalai lama on 22 august and a meeting before the end of the year are a sign that in order to make progress on peace dialogue and mutual respect are better than provocation and violence
2048511 we now sincerely hope that in beijing tomorrow president sarkozy as the chairman of the european union will raise with president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao the current crackdown in tibet and the need for china to engage in sincere and results oriented talks with the dalai lama and his representatives
2048512 what do you expect me to do that i sit saying my god it is not possible we have to try and if france does not try who will we try to do it tibet is part of china when general de gaulle recognized china in 1964 he recognized china with tibet the dalai lama himself does not advocate for the independence of tibet french should know that the tibet autonomous region is huge it is twice the size of france and if it comes to historical tibet it is big around seven times the size of france the dalai lama does also not ask for a boycott of the olympic games but it is necessary that tibet have a greater autonomy and that the chinese authorities make a gesture that they show for tibet the same pragmatism they were able to show for hong kong
2048513 there was a big problem with the kid in that he belonged to chelsea
2048514 the club wouldnt let him go and so it wouldnt have been easy for him to come

2048518 green business is not about forgoing profit for the sake of the planet but quite the opposite what was previously manager vs environment is now seen as a hand in hand partnership which offers huge financial benefits
2048519 the true price of a product harvested without an environmental conscience inevitably becomes much more expensive in the long run as somewhere along the line the bill has to be picked up
2048520 the aim is to educate future key business leaders with the business skills needed to look at the financial environmental and social implications of management decisions the fact that we are online also keeps us inline with the policies we teach unburdened by the demands of a traditional brick and mortar institution

2048532 migrants are coming home from u s with dollars ideas and little patience for the old way of doing things
2048533 in isolated pockets throughout mexico especially in far flung rural areas groups of migrants are entering the political arena for many returning migrants the lessons they learned in places such as austin are guiding their forays into politics before they left mexico for the united states many of them were the poorest and often the least educated residents of their towns and villages they are returning with dollars ideas and little patience for the old way of doing things

2048535 tenants were understandably nervous about paying for a service that they were unsure in advance they would benefit from
2048536 there is no kick back to the brewery it is completely transparent and has been done because we genuinely want tenants to keep costs down and avoid inertia at this difficult time for our industry
2048537 it is also hugely useful in advance of future change of tenancies as we can help and inform in going tenants of what can be achieved for that particular pub at offer stage rather than wait until they get the keys on change day
2048538 they dont have to take advantage obviously but at least it allows them to be better informed and hopefully make better business decisions

2048561 but when the vincent bugliosi fool says he wants to assassinate president bush the liberal left is silent in agreement if its hussein obama then its a news headline
2048562 alan why the image of the mccain bus sinking with the implication of killing all those aboard you dont like mccain because he is a christian or whatever the reason is i dont know but why then the image of a non water craft sinking unless its to float the idea of killing the gop candidate
2048563 well eight years ago i had civil rights and a right to due process and some expectation of privacy from governmental intrusion and even this vague idea that in case of national emergency my government might be able to figure out where the prize is in a box of cracker jacks and then bush came along and turned the running of the government over to the buffoons in his college fraternity and theyre lucky if they can figure out which end to wipe when they pull on a roll of charmin

2048571 the problem with lawyers is that their personalities change to suit their profession they are like accountants they like to argue over every detail now that makes it extremely difficult to get on with in any relationship

2048578 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2048579 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have

2048593 the abff is an international film festival that started about 12 years ago at the acapulco black film festival
2048594 its a five day event geared to give black filmmakers from around the world the opportunity to showcase their movies as well as give black actors and black artists a chance to showcase their work this is bringing the aspiring artists community together with the accomplished community and with media and corporations and throwing them all in one captive environment and watch all the magical things happen
2048595 its important because there are not many vehicles to showcase black art and that extends beyond film and entertainment
2048596 i used to go to the mainstream festivals around the world just as a film fan and i would rarely see films that were either made by black people of starred black people or were really about the black experience you just wondered do african americans make movies then in 1997 i was with two good friends and we decided to model a festival after sundance a black film festival what we discovered is that there are many black films in fact we had 19 film submissions our very first year and this year we got 400 there are black movies out there its just somebodys got to take it on to give them a place to be seen and thats what we decided to do
2048597 we came to la because we wanted to connect a bit more with industry insiders which were the studios and high level executives
2048598 we were getting a lot of participation from the actors and directors but we were getting werent really getting a lot of love from the studios we came here two years ago to really get on the map with regard to some of the big studios this festival really isnt about where we are its about we do while were here so we really do try to make our destination secondary to what were all about
2048599 were using the festival to create dialog and show films that deal with that kind of poignant issues related to romance and sexuality
2048600 the real issue is that there has been a shortage over the last 50 years in american film of films that star black people that deal with any aspect of romance and sexuality so we really want to explore that were going to be doing a number of special screenings
2048601 it was the first film that cast two black actors in a romantic sexual context
2048602 and were going to close with an hbo documentary the premiere of a film called the black list its a documentary about the lives careers and challenges of many african american people from all walks of life from entertainment and politics to people who have social and media careers and that sort of thing these are two very important films to open and close the festival
2048603 about half of our audience is people from the industry the other half is people who just like films and want to be in the mix
2048604 we encourage people to come out and not be intimidated by the thought that it might be an industry thing or an insider thing it certainly is not
2048605 you dont have to have a vision camera to play vp2 and you still get all the same content

2048610 we have developed a working class sleeper that provides outstanding comfort and storage in addition fleet owners will benefit from better rested more productive drivers all geared to help improve driver retention and their bottom line
2048611 drivers often noted that there wasnt much room in their sleepers and the room they did have was inefficient
2048612 along with having a reliable truck getting a good nights rest was equally as important to drivers
2048613 the availability of a top of the line mattress is one way we can satisfy drivers comfort needs

2048633 the possibility of the site flooding directly from the adjacent watercourse would appear to be significantly higher than stated
2048634 from the information provided we cannot make any rational judgement on the extent of flood risk without a further engineering assessment

2048642 we called for shabanov to be acquitted for an end to the criminal case and for him to be freed but the judge was afraid to do so and instead sent the case back for further investigation
2048643 we expect they will try again to imprison shabanov and we will try again to get him freed
2048644 hes not guilty they are doing this solely because he is a christian
2048645 we regard this as a first victory but there is still much struggle ahead to free hamid
2048646 hamid spoke up in court to declare that he was not guilty but they are one team the police the prosecutors and the judge
2048647 were very unhappy we want hamid vindicated and freed but they dont want to free him
2048648 the proceedings are not objective the whole case is a charade theyre holding him now at the police station as if hes a terrorist
2048649 hasanov called me an armenian spy who acts only for money
2048650 he demanded in a threatening manner that i should not return to zakatala stop helping local baptists and that i should abandon my faith
2048651 he also told me that there is a special instruction not to allow baptists to function in zakatala district

2048690 the dilemma for mol is what omv will do with its stake
2048691 mol may be interested in buying it back but it cant afford to do that at the same time as its moving to raise its stake in ina
2048692 they can combine with a russian firm to form a major force in eastern europe also a combination with polands pkn would be quite good and synergetic
2048693 it cannot be denied that the defense strategy of mol was effective but it also created serious concerns regarding corporate governance in europe generally and also for hungary and the region

2048706 at the same time the government shouldnt be exhausted and be made unable to offer services to people as required because of the huge population increase
2048707 preachers activities shouldnt be confined only to educating people who go to mosques they should go to people wherever they are in schools institutes universities factories farms unions and camps

2048725 with the rash of animal attacks we believe this is a wise course of action
2048726 the problem for the fire department getting to the scenes of emergencies is that sometimes it takes us 20 minutes to get there

2048733 i think it is difficult to imagine a chief executive without a touch of ruthlessness
2048734 we started this financial year with 36 000 rooms so our plan is for a 50 increase i believe there is plenty of opportunity to at least achieve that and well look and see how much more we can do when we have
2048735 were focusing on the gulf because its a mature hotel market with a lot of four and five star hotels and very little budget sector
2048736 although theres significant challenge in the future i see beefeater and brewers fayre as absolutely vital to whitbread our core model is a site with a premier inn and one of our restaurants
2048737 i get enthusiastic simply imagining where we could be in a few years from now my job is to make sure it happens
2048738 i think there will always be a future for sensibly priced well run hotels its just that there are a number of hotels that are probably past their sell by date out there
2048739 we were expecting an inflation of around 3 this year but were seeing about 8 food cost increases were absorbing a lot of it and have also re priced while talking to suppliers about how we can buy better but im loath to pass big increases on to customers

2048753 the remaining intact natural forests constitute a significant standing stock of carbon that should be protected from carbon emitting land use activities
2048754 there is substantial potential for carbon sequestration in forest areas that have been logged if they are allowed to re grow undisturbed by further intensive human land use activities
2048755 we initially thought we would discuss the eu this autumn and perhaps organise a popular vote
2048756 but because of the problems caused by the irish referendum it is no longer the most pressing issue
2048757 we still believe the exemptions hinder denmark and the fairest thing would be to give people a vote on the issue during the current parliament in principle until november 2011
2048758 but it is too early to propose another date for a referendum while the irish situation remains unclear
2048759 we can come out with a formula where manny can make the most money he will ever make manny can make two or three or even four or five times what hes been making so i feel that bob arum and richard schaefer can realistically make this fight happen
2048760 as far as i know abs cbn is by far the biggest and the best when it comes to covering fights and december 6 is my date i choose where the fight gets covered and whoever brings the better deal to the table then they are the ones who get it and from what i have seen in the past abs cbn has been the best at bringing the best fights to the philippines
2048761 we want to make a deal richard and i whether it can be made or not i dont know it will take give and take on both sides
2048762 im a lot more comfortable with the pro game in my early days i was a third or fourth line penalty killer without knowing how to use my speed i was always going full tilt now i know better
2048763 im also more willing to listen to suggestions coaches and other players have for me than earlier in my career
2048764 when i came out of bu i thought i knew everything now ive learned from that mistake
2048765 when i went to norfolk in 2005 06 a lot changed
2048766 i got moved to the first line on power plays and the game really slowed down for me i was able to play with some great players and i learned to see all the ice
2048767 i had coach haviland in atlantic city then in norfolk and he was fantastic
2048768 he prevented me from quitting in 2002 2003 he told me that if i stepped away from the game then i would regret it for the rest of my life the working world would always be there for me but hockey would not im glad i took his advice
2048769 i want to be a player in the organization that improves our depth and is able to push the other guys along
2048770 i want guys on the verge of making the leap to the nhl to lean on me watch how i play the game and ask me questions that will help them develop and take the next step i relish the opportunity to play that role
2048771 through speaking with him and talking to other teams we have found that carl has three things that we look for in a player hes a hard worker a good person and a real team player all of which fit very well into our plans
2048772 when we won the beanpot for my first time it was unbelievable
2048773 it was the best memory of my career so far
2048774 theres just something about playing in this area that really excites me
2048775 were cycling for the cause of raising awareness of poverty both internationally and here at home
2048776 our economy is not set up currently to pay 4 dollars a gallon for a long period of time
2048777 we need to develop more sources and have options so that if saudi arabia were to say were not going to sell oil to you anymore we dont have oil prices jump up to such a level that our economys just crippled
2048778 you dont loose anything thats what were doing here nothings lost
2048779 i think congress will care becuase they do want energy prices to go down
2048780 we recorded strong recurring revenue based on good sales growth from our broad base of 2g and 3g patent licensees we also secured our first product win for our slimchip tm high performance mobile broadband ic and successfully delivered our 3g modem ip to a fabless customer
2048781 we also progressed nicely toward our top priority of growing our base of new 3g patent licensees including the very important task of signing all of the top 5 manufacturers
2048782 toward that end the u s international trade commission usitc action against samsung moved forward with the evidentiary hearing held in july we believe our case is going very well and we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter last week we also prevailed in two important legal actions one against samsung and the other against nokia the decision by the arbitral tribunal in the samsung matter confirmed interdigitals position that samsung cannot use the 2006 settlement agreement between interdigital and nokia to avoid its obligation determined by a prior arbitration panel to pay over 150 million in royalties owed for samsungs sale of 2g handsets as for nokia we believe the decision of the second circuit court of appeals clears the path for the resumption of the usitc investigation regarding nokias sales of 3g terminal units these positive developments create the right environment for the resolution of these patent license disputes on favorable terms
2048783 our second quarter was strong with a sequential increase in royalty revenue from several of our licensees combined with a decrease in our core operating expenses as well as a decrease in litigation and arbitration costs
2048784 as is our practice we will provide an update on our expectation for third quarter 2008 revenue after we receive and review the applicable royalty reports and update our forecasts on anticipated revenue from work associated with technology solution agreements
2048785 sarah lacys very readable book pulls back the veil from the new princes of web 2 0 and that it is as much about attitude as it is about business

2048788 i come up from sarasota florida i have a place here so i come up for the yard sale i plan my august every year
2048789 weston and buckhannon are so close geographically anyway but it kind of creates a regional thing people can get off exit 99 and go either way to yard sales
2048790 oh just seeing if we can find some good bargains could be clothes could be what nots
2048791 the healthier system would allow more flows through the darling and into nsw there is water available in the darling basin and its for sale
2048792 buying these properties would be a win win win for the environment for the communities in the basin and for willing sellers
2048793 this indicates that you can close the skills gap because these teenagers are very good at using it

2048805 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2048806 distribution is estimated to continue through the end of the year

2048815 the combined effort of indianas retail community and our customers through the hbc website www beveragechoices com is a sensible approach to modernize the states alcoholic beverage laws
2048816 sunday the second busiest shopping day of the week is important to shoppers while cold beer sales in drug grocery and convenience stores add competition to a retail segment too long controlled by liquor store owners
2048817 we are mindful of ways to make the shopping experience more convenient for our customers

2048824 do whats right if you really believe that you want to help him and help us get through it then go back
2048825 if youve ever eaten rainier cherries snacked on washington grown raspberries and strawberries or sipped one of our states premium wines youve already sampled some of the products of wsu research
2048826 there were people deceased from the front of the bus to the back of the bus
2048827 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
2048828 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2048829 i myself cried this morning when i heard the news
2048830 i know in my bones that the paralympics feeds the publics considerable appetite for admiring our pluckiness and courage reinforcing the tedious stereotype of the brave crip
2048831 i just dont buy it that people watch the paralympics first and foremost for its value as a sporting spectacle
2048832 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
2048833 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
2048834 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2048835 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2048836 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2048837 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
2048838 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2048839 we have already undertaken a series of initiatives including raising more than 7 billion in additional capital in the second quarter to help us manage through the most difficult u s housing market in more than 70 years
2048840 these statistics are becoming increasingly worrying and for the average amount of spam blocked per person to have nearly quadrupled in the last 3 months suggests that action desperately needs to be taken
2048841 it is reassuring to see some positive results and it is clear that some companies have been working hard to eliminate fraudulent emails entering their users accounts however as one company improves its fraud prevention another company shoots its way up the index unfortunately unless isps anti spam and anti virus providers all work together the quantities of hoax spam entering email accounts will just continue to rise
2048842 the ultimate in its class if you want the best this is it
2048843 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2048844 this project gives us an opportunity to team up with the central bank of libya and introduce a whole new world of epayments across the libyan banks venture infotek with its decade long experience in transaction processing and knowledge management will be able to support the central bank of libya in setting up a nationwide infrastructure to enable epayments we look forward to a fruitful and long standing relationship with the central bank of libya
2048845 hedge funds underperformed in july due to sharp reversals in the equity markets during the second half of the month
2048846 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kickstart the market in the way that people think it might
2048847 we know for example that deposits have gone up because the old mortgages have gone and now lenders are asking for bigger deposits
2048848 stamp duty for the people who pay it and many people who dont represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues to make sure we get it right
2048849 we did not want to as a university be affiliated with the company so we no longer collaborate in research relationships with the company and they also are no longer considered a university affiliate
2048850 allows the president to regulate the conduct of business internationally under certain circumstances a step which was taken with regard to iran
2048851 atls guilty plea acknowledged that the corporation conspired with another to trade with the islamic republic of iran in violation of the law
2048852 specifically atl and its related corporate entities conspired to land and execute a 95 000 000 contract with the iranian information technology company to rebuild and upgrade the telecommunications systems of approximately 20 iranian cities including tehran
2048853 they have a lease thats not with us but what we can control is whether or not we do collaborative research whether or not we allow them access to some of the resources that they would get if they were a partner that we would want to be affiliated with
2048854 we would no longer consider them an affiliate to n c state university
2048855 previous research has shown that a childs risk of developing asthma is lower if he or she is exposed to bacteria or bacterial products in early life probably because it assists in the development of a childs immune system
2048856 however our research suggests that one possible mechanism for this hypothesis may involve the chemicals found in domestic cleaning products
2048857 i thought shes 9 years old and shes going to be scarred for life
2048858 but they can cause scarring or darkness to the skin that can be permanent
2048859 it may mean you can never dye your hair again
2048860 this was a little booth set up at the hotel pool and i didnt think anything of it
2048861 i guess they tossed my skateboard because we found it back in those bushes
2048862 just one example is in surgery where they just could not have coped with the increase in workload without the ondemand system
2048863 we think a lot of bad things that happen to the cardiovascular system are because the lining of the vessels cracks and becomes inflamed setting the stage for plaques to form and rupture
2048864 there were a lot of people on the street a number of rounds were fired
2048865 the male driving the atv left the scene the officer chased him where he obviously ran into the gate and he tried to escape or elude police he tried to go over the gate and he impaled himself
2048866 hms will allow us to take the next step into providing safe efficient care for our patients which is most important
2048867 the system will also give us the tools to properly pre screen register and bill our patients effectively
2048868 the hms solutions will enable the hospital to provide quality health care and deliver that care as efficiently as possible now and in the future as the health system grows
2048869 items arrived in big trucks and we would break it down put it on the arc trucks and it would be distributed throughout the state
2048870 we went right to work the first day we were there
2048871 the way this works is we have three sites in every town we work out of usually in a parking lot all the cars of the disaster victims have to do is come in pick up what they need and drive on bleach was a big thing needed for the flooding damage
2048872 behind them are trucks with personal items and cleaning equipment
2048873 we passed out a lot of deodorant toothpaste and soap then theres a truck that distributes mops gloves brooms cleanup kits things like that people ate then went from one truck to the other if we didnt have what they needed we wrote it down and took the list back to the warehouse so they could get it
2048874 washer dryer drywall carpeting everything they had to stand in the street and look at all that trash and in many cases the frames of the houses im sure had to be replaced they were underwater a long time you really felt sorry for those people
2048875 we were able to give something we didnt give after katrina
2048876 i knew something was missing when i was there and i couldnt think of what it was it was toys we didnt have toys that would have been a big morale thing there
2048877 and the residents they had the right attitude they were going to fix their houses one way or another iowans are hard workers midwestern farmers good people
2048878 youve never seen so much mud all you could see was the foundations of about 60 homes
2048879 the red cross paid for everything including the volunteers airfare when your 21 days were up you were processed out and went home and another volunteer immediately took your place everyone should donate to the red cross its just unbelievable
2048880 jeg er thurston moore med meg p scenen har jeg lee ronaldo og kim gordon jeg trenger ikke bevise en dritt

2048882 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2048883 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2048884 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2048885 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2048886 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2048887 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2048888 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2048889 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2048890 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2048891 this was a concept i was discussing with eric willis a few weeks ago when the opportunity rose for media mayhem to work with nassiri
2048892 we got to thinking about the timing of the 2008 olympic games in beijing as well as a number of other pressing events around the world and we wanted to be part of something positive out there and this is media mayhems way of doing our part to raise awareness that love is blind and sees no color
2048893 we are throwing the whole ball of wax into this campaign
2048894 its a really brilliant concept and something that will be moving and powerful
2048895 i believe that it is important to reach out to the people in need and that is why i have decided to donate not just a portion but all of the proceeds to charity
2048896 not because of any problems or concerns with the quality of assets or investments but purely as a defensive measure in response to extraordinary market conditions there is no suggestion that any assets or investments are impaired
2048897 the reality is that in this market valuations and prices are under pressure but you never know until you test the market
2048898 there has been a huge surge in people seeing finance company collapses and wanting to get their money out its the pressure of those people wanting to get their money out its a bit of a nightmare
2048899 these mortgage trusts hold a relatively small percentage of cash in accordance with their trust deed most of its invested in properties otherwise theyd be a cash fund
2048900 looking at it from a wider perspective our political and tax policies have made property one of the key investment avenues outside of banks we havent been diversifying enough
2048901 we have just got to get the striker to sign the contract which i fully believe he will this afternoon the signing will take our squad to 18 but he is the not the player i went to visit in the north west last week that has fallen through
2048902 paul dana was a hero to so many as an irl driver a personality and an advocate for biofuels he made a difference and was an inspiration
2048903 in a very short time indiana has become a national leader in the biofuels industry today we recognize the states corn and soybean farmers who have helped indiana achieve such success
2048904 indianas corn and soybean famers have been valuable partners as we continue to expand our biofuels industry
2048905 we are committed to the production and use of biofuels because they burn cleaner reduce the states dependence on foreign sources of energy and increase the economic opportunities for hoosiers
2048906 you had a blood clot my dad has a coffin so i cant say i feel sorry for you as for your kids i dont know if i should even bring them up but personally i think youre better off without them youre not much of a role model
2048907 knowing that he died because of the choice that i made and no matter what punishment i receive today i will punish myself for the rest of my life and i hope one day you will find forgiveness for what i have done and i am truly sorry for the life that i have taken
2048908 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2048909 axes were always being sharpened for brown barely days into the job
2048910 this is one of the indistinct circumstances a coach has been fired there is a certain power hungry group which controls zimbabwe cricket from outside the top brass unfortunately we have a meek administration so they are easily controlled by them
2048911 all the home grown candidates have either been tried or turned their backs
2048912 nobody with any credibility from overseas would touch the job so you wonder who on earth they will turn to
2048913 99 percent nothing more than a child being a spoiled brat
2048914 but a truth and friendship commission is only one mechanism for addressing past atrocities
2048915 will be the first step towards achieving justice and reconciliation
2048916 it doesnt matter to me why kids pick on each other
2048917 i just want to be able to help stop it
2048918 i feel it is very important for children to learn about the harmful affects of bullying at a young age
2048919 if we can reach them before they experience it first hand our children will be able to identify and prevent this destructive behavior
2048920 reaching kids on their own level is the only way to stop the cycle
2048921 i geared this book toward young children to show them how unhappy the pumpkin goblin is when he picks on the neighborhood children it isnt until a little boy befriends him that the big bully realizes how much nicer it is to have friends rather than people who are afraid of you a central message here is picking on others doesnt make your pain go away
2048922 give them the tools to not be a bully and give them the ideas of how to make a bully into a friend rather than a rival kindness and respect isnt just the best thing for the kid being attacked its the best thing for the bully too
2048923 as is true for all of us here in researching renewable fuel the mission of biofuels research is also to increase environmental political and economic security for all of us and for future generations
2048924 it is critical in the near future to find an alternative to liquid fuel for transportation which requires minimal changes to our vehicles
2048925 in addition to the various forms of biomass we can consider for biofuel as well as the variety of forms of biofuel there are different process options physical conversion chemical and biological
2048926 we are lucky in our faculty to have a strong research program in each of these transformation technologies
2048927 i think this is definitely perfect for me from a learning standpoint
2048928 it doesnt get any better than starting your career at ku
2048929 we have preliminary information that the perpetrator was on a green beach cruiser type bicycle
2048930 all yall went to school at john e ford elementary
2048931 i know somebody knows something please tell me who killed my son
2048932 its just totally senseless now that these events are happening as often as they are right now
2048933 but were committed to this community to continue to fight this fight and were going to win
2048934 im going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months
2048935 we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine that folks need a break from politics
2048936 but the majority of people have been fed a constant stream of political chatter and im sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2048937 americans are facing sky high gas prices and instead of barack obama taking the initiative to call his allies in congress back from vacation to carve out real energy relief hes joining them at the beach
2048938 as long as he doesnt go windsurfing he should be ok
2048939 im not in the anticipatory mode yet because quite frankly were going on vacation
2048940 revellers are urged to only bring what they can carry and to leave valuables at home if you do bring anything into the site that is valuable to you then please make sure you use the lockers
2048941 i would also urge people not to be tempted to buy tickets from touts if you do there will be a good chance that you are throwing your money away as your ticket could be fake
2048942 considering the huge number of people who come to the festival it is usually a peaceful and well organised event where a good time is had by all
2048943 my plea to people coming to the festival is very simple have a good time and enjoy yourselves but use your common sense and dont bring valuables like mp3 players there will be enough going on to keep you entertained without them
2048944 the oil market right now is overwhelmingly preoccupied with poor u s oil demand
2048945 the market is choosing to ignore somewhat some of the supply side issues such as the pipeline fire
2048946 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon 3 8 liters before we really see any change in driving habits
2048947 the inventory data again confirmed that product demand has been slow and backed up this bearish view of the u s market
2048948 weve been around other teams and weve been having a lot of fun weve had some great times playing our games and winning two was great even though we lost two i still had an exciting time in those games
2048949 this has been a great experience a lot of fun
2048950 i am so excited but nervous at the same time
2048951 i didnt expect to be on the 12 year old team i expected to be on the 11 year old team being on this team is a once in a lifetime experience this has helped me a lot it is just unbelievable
2048952 i am having so much fun it has been a great experience i was nervous before we came i just knew i had to step up my game
2048953 i didnt get the one thing i wanted a foul ball or a home run ball but it was a lot of fun
2048954 that was an experience because we got to get autographs signed by the bullpen
2048955 you have to think about your team if you play as a team you are going to win im probably a better player now than i was when we started
2048956 you have to play tough all the time because nobody is going to give you any slack
2048957 we are trying to act as a team it doesnt work out all the time but we are trying
2048958 ive learned a little bit we are just having a great time here
2048959 im nervous for our team im nervous and im pumped
2048960 i even counted every hour every minute every second because i hope to see the opening because you are that excited i am that excited
2048961 this is a lucky charm you put in your car
2048962 its nice to see our asian community participating in this and making us aware and having whats available in beijing right here in philadelphia
2048963 i am very proud to be chinese to have olympics in my country and i think its a good opportunity to tell everybody how great china is today
2048964 this event allows people to forget about their own provincialism whether they are from shanghai canton they are all chinese and they are all coming together to help out the best face on for the event
2048965 a lot of damage if it goes on for a year and counting
2048966 people do not buy camera phones for the camera they buy phone that should have camera along with it but camera phones are certainly common among those who can afford them and now a large number can and they are high on the wish lists of those who still do not have them they are considered cool or just plain fun for them having camera phones is a lifestyle
2048967 visit any campus and see how people use the phones with camera there is great peer pressure to join the picture messaging crowd notwithstanding interpretability and multiple standards
2048968 it is my hobby i have been changing my mobile every six month till i bought my present camera mobile
2048969 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2048970 that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope
2048971 ya kin take the boy out of da country but ya cant take the country out of da boy
2048972 they come down and you cant wipe the smiles off their faces when you start taking off and you look back theyre holding on to the bottom of the seat then after five minutes theyre waving at people and looking over the side and they cant believe how stable it is and the view they cant believe the view
2048973 that ought to be respected by the other states and the federal government
2048974 doma takes the discretion the ffcc gives congress to define the manner amp method of translation and reads it to allow congress to simply deny full faith amp credit to same sex marriages
2048975 has shown up in scotus rulings most recently off the top of my head and very explicitly in the 7 2
2048976 ought to be an outmoded way of interpreting the ffcc at the very least its textually dishonest
2048977 the concept was to have the whole program on the college campus
2048978 accept you if you act mature but if youre immature they wont even help you
2048979 they would harass me over stupid things like the way i look and the way i act and they would judge me
2048980 it gives you a challenge if thats what youre into
2048981 it gives you a better education youre pretty much doing everything double time
2048982 i havent had an issue with respect no real discipline issues in the classroom
2048983 ongoing changes to employment law and health amp safety legislation have significant implications for business owners directors and senior management in the seafood industry for example many of them are probably not aware that the maximum compensation for unfair dismissal is now 60 600 or that minimum holiday entitlement is to increase from april 1 2009
2048984 we will also be outlining how employers face criminal prosecution if they are negligent on health amp safety matters the seminar will provide useful information and tips to help business owners understand their responsibilities and this in turn will help them to conform to best practice and avoid costly tribunals
2048985 fundamental redesign of both arizonas prek 12 education system and the post secondary system that supports education preparation programs must be implemented to ensure each child in arizona receives the quality education necessary to be competitive in a global marketplace

2048987 no es m s f cil trabajar para eddy que trabajar para steve
2048988 this is the first time ive decided to leave something i really truly love i will dearly miss getting a chance to work with
2048989 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2048990 in a normal circumstance the bylaw is pretty clear and the understanding is that the responsibility of the homeowner is for the service connection anything back from the main
2048991 is this a normal circumstance thats what were looking at
2048992 when we went down there we couldnt believe our eyes
2048993 if theres a blockage in the main then its the towns responsibility
2048994 were not looking to get our house remodeled or something
2048995 we just want to not have diseases that could be carried through solid sludge in our basement
2048996 putting things in right now is a lot slower than last year
2048997 weve got a lot of rookie kids stepping into positions right now we dont have as much in as we did at this time last year and its just taking a little bit longer to get things done we just have a rookie team and its going to take time for this team to gel
2048998 all that stuff always carries over to the next year
2048999 thats just a winning attitude that carries over since then though weve moved people around position wise and were trying to put people in the best places to make them and the team successful
2049000 it takes a little while to make things click even though were still doing all the same things as last year the timing just isnt there right now were just not hitting on all cylinders and thats not unusual for this time of year the machine part of it isnt there yet
2049001 ive definitely liked the effort the kids have demonstrated thus far
2049002 our kids are working hard in practice and theyre giving everything theyve got each time out
2049003 these kids are going to get there because theyve worked hard all year and theyre working hard in practice but its just going to take a little bit more time for them to come together we really have to have a smaller playbook and build off of that right now
2049004 its just a practice the first scrimmage is just a practice with the biggest difference that were going against different people
2049005 were looking to improve every practice with our timing our knowledge of the game and our technique timing and technique are the big things and right now we dont have either one of them
2049006 were building on our depth chart now because were going through contact
2049007 when you go through the motions and arent hitting then everyone can look good at times
2049008 for chinese people they want the bride to go out of the house in the morning
2049009 if the rest of china can adapt to that cantonese superstition why not nevada
2049010 im thinking that it is going to be a really big weekend
2049011 since were open until midnight that gives them a chance to come over the hill and get their license on 8 8 8
2049012 its really the luckiest day especially for the chinese people
2049013 everybody is taking advantage of this lucky date everybody needs luck
2049014 its just like any other day the symbol is nice but its nothing special
2049015 they activision liked my music and i have a big young following ive been told im from the old school i dont own a computer i just got an ipod that ive organized i have got to learn how to turn it on thats about it you know i cant download i cant do any load
2049016 i had to put on this black suit with all these little ping pong ball like things all over me motion capture i had to dance around like im on stage when one of my songs are on i dont really know how it works but i have seen a run of it it is really interesting the image of me i wish i had the energy it has the graphics are really really good

2049018 cloudav virtualises and parallelises detection functionality with multiple antivirus engines significantly increasing overall protection
2049019 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2049020 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2049021 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
2049022 the joint partnership will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of an all electric vehicle in california
2049023 partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid
2049024 by working with mitsubishi we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability vehicle data vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback
2049025 it is easier for the human being to make himself the dictator of all other creatures and of nature
2049026 a way of life that is respectful of the environment
2049027 perhaps reluctantly we come to acknowledge that there are also scars which mark the surface of our earth erosion deforestation the squandering of the worlds mineral and ocean resources in order to fuel an insatiable consumption
2049028 the ministry plans to mount extensive professional development programmes to upgrade the capacity of teachers
2049029 both an adequate knowledge of the subject and the ability to deliver needs to be built
2049030 but we have to admit that that many of the general teachers are doing a fine job teaching dzongkha but also many are struggling
2049031 we can invite recruit and engage science and maths teachers from outside but bhutan is the home of dzongkha we need to train our teachers on home ground
2049032 make their knowledge and experience available at this critical juncture
2049033 theres a perception not wholly true that dzongkha teachers have limited scope in terms of movement outside of teaching and across careers but this situation is gradually changing because of the demand for dzongkha teachers and the need to improve the use and range of our national language
2049034 both ddc and the education sector are working to promote dzongkha and a shortage of language teacher is affecting the quality of the national language
2049035 experimenting with new recipes is an important part of a brewers life and it has been a great experience to create in duchy originals select ale a new style old style brew
2049036 the university of toronto is looking forward to this opportunity to bring its multidisciplinary strengths to bear on the most compelling public policy challenges facing the province and canada faculty and students in a wide range of fields will work together to ensure the latest and best thinking comes from this exciting and innovative institute
2049037 we know that people care about the traffic and road information that affects their drive the most by using the trafficeye canadians will have a reliable and convenient source of traffic information before they hit the roads
2049038 there is no way for the institutions to win this fight and they know that
2049039 hey grant you aint the lone ranger we all got problems
2049040 youre just going to be a coward and kill yourself
2049041 i think any reasonable man when youre talking to a depressed suicidal individual youre not going to challenge him
2049042 i think its almost common sense but they need more training in that or at least to use the training they receive
2049043 my delegation also fully endorses the colombo statement on food security which clearly demonstrates our collective resolve and solidarity to address the challenges posed by rising food prices
2049044 this reinforces the need to redouble our efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger particularly through agriculture and rural development
2049045 given the seriousness of the subject of food security we felt that it deserves to be addressed through a special statement released along with the colombo declaration
2049046 for instance everybody in bhutan now wants to eat rice and eats rice earlier many bhutanese didnt eat rice our staple was different
2049047 why we have food crisis is not due to production going down but because food consumption has gone up substantially mainly due to growing prosperity
2049048 they guaranteed this building would be low income very low income for 30 years from 1990 to 2020
2049049 provoke us or attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2049050 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
2049051 every day that the centrifuges continue to spin brings iran closer to a nuclear weapons capability and threatens the stability and security of the region and the world
2049052 weve always said iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
2049053 as you know from the previous experience dealing with this issue a lot of the negotiations about the sanctions specifically what would be included is negotiated outside the u n system
2049054 since i havent heard anything here in this building to this point i think its not entirely reckless to assume that september is the next opportunity
2049055 rather than focus almost entirely on sanctions lets focus on opportunities
2049056 their goal is to obtain a nuclear weapon and believing otherwise is an illusion
2049057 there is still time because the sanctions are efficient but i say this once again firmly the world and israel must leave all options open the disaster will be an iran with nuclear weapons
2049058 we do have our occasional heated discussions we have 1000 developers and that sometimes means on any given topic we may have 2000 opinions theres no telling people this is what were going to do its more of the consensus approach if i tried anything without a reasonable amount of backing from the developers ill probably get shot
2049059 i like to get on with people i tend to be quite easy going one of my roles as dpl i see as helping to spread news about the project by talking to journalists and talking to other people in the community as well i really enjoy it
2049060 i wish those two girls could have lived that much longer
2049061 the united state supreme court the judiciary which everyone learned in civics is the ultimate arbiter of what the law is and what it says decided that the executive branch didnt have the authority to interfere with a legitimate judgment from a texas court
2049062 every time youre stopped in a traffic violation or some kind of border issue in any country the vienna convention attaches power and authority to you and youre diminishing that power enormously by violating that law
2049063 i think that is something that is a better debate for law school professors than for people that travel to cozumel or istanbul i dont see that from a common sense standpoint as a legitimate concern
2049064 were just thankful that its over with and we have one more and look forward every day to that last execution of peter cantu
2049065 constantly have to think what do we have to do that we can maintain jobs and create new jobs and improve the quality of life for people
2049066 the volumes have just fallen off the face of the earth especially the transfer case business so we are re evaluating our position
2049067 if we cant fix this thing you know one solution might be that we have to shut this facility down
2049068 we just ratified a contract as everybodys aware only a few months back and the inks hardly dry as you can imagine our members are somewhat upset and i dont blame them
2049069 we will do everything we can to keep this business in syracuse as a bargaining committee we will work day and night to make sure that the right things happen but we will also be very very sensitive to the fact that our folks have already given and given and given

2049078 though you have made me see troubles many and bitter you will restore my life again from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up
2049079 the lord is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms
2049080 i lift my eyes up to the hills where does my help come from my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth
2049081 oh no not him and his family this couldnt have happened to them they are such great people and have done such great things
2049082 we run rac do we need to purchase a license to develop and test in this environment
2049083 this document may not be incorporated into any contract and does not constitute a contract or a commitment to any specific terms
2049084 so to seek clarification on what a license means lewisc is pointed to a document that is definitely not part of the contract and which is therefore entirely nugatory
2049085 of course and its the otn one available for free usable by more than one person and in a rac or data guard environment provided each install is performed using freshly downloaded software
2049086 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have over come the world
2049087 for the lord himelf shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
2049088 he cannot come to me but i can go to him
2049089 never have never will i abandon you and the god that i have always been i will forever be for i am with you i am for you so believe me now i am the god that never wastes a single hurt that you endure and all my promises are sure so belive me now
2049090 he had a full life it was just 11 days long whereas some are much longer
2049091 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of christ jesus
2049092 for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever
2049093 never will i leave you never will i forsake you
2049094 the peace of god which is deeper than all knowledge will keep your hearts and minds
2049095 what an incredible person what a strong christian what a wonderful father
2049096 it is not the years in your life but the life in your years that counts
2049097 for me to live is christ to die is gain
2049098 to give students one more opportunity one more reason to say no and if we do target individuals that have a problem is to try to get some assistance to them and their families
2049099 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalized lack of empowerment to claim goods and services to which other population groups have greater access
2049100 he entered a decision for andrew and against j p morgan chase
2049101 he looked at each sides motions and ruled in our favor the matejas are very relieved
2049102 thats when the police and everybody came and they started taking out the bodies and stuff like that
2049103 living here every day looking at that for my kids its tough cause they were here
2049104 for some reason when you see names and you see memorials and stuff like that it just makes it a little tougher
2049105 were considering all leads looking at vehicles that were on scene looking at vehicles that were seen leaving the scene trying to determine exactly what our suspect description is
2049106 real club deportivo and newcastle have this evening wednesday sealed the transfer of fabricio coloccini to the english club
2049107 both clubs had come to a verbal agreement last week but today it was signed in writing
2049108 i still honestly believe that we will get two more players in maybe three and then well settle down and work very hard with a quality squad
2049109 you look at the players we used tonight and the players that werent there possibly with two or three additions well have a strong squad
2049110 i think we have to look to finish in the top ten in the top half and anything beyond that well take our chance
2049111 come christmas well see what were doing and maybe we can strengthen again
2049112 people might want to do better with their health but the lack of money the lack of medical care and the lack of access in low income neighborhoods to healthy foods and safe physical activity are the things that low income people in fresno and the valley areas face
2049113 bottom line if youre poor or a minority you are potentially in trouble health wise california needs to renew its efforts at seeking a solution to our lack of health insurance overall
2049114 obviously the guy having to lose weight should have a harder time than the guy whos putting it on but this is different
2049115 pacquiao will be coming way up while oscar only has to lose a few pounds from what he weighed when he fought forbes
2049116 our customers want that product electricity when the light switch is flipped
2049117 there is no one answer that will solve the energy issues we are facing in florida
2049118 a god send for levy county we need this power plant and the jobs it will bring our citizens
2049119 we will be using a variety of criteria including activity on the playstation network to determine eligibility for the beta community
2049120 were really excited about this milestone and want our most loyal fans to be a part of the evolution of playstation home
2049121 in europe scee is also beginning their expanded closed beta directly targeting consumers who have been most active on playstation network and playstation store
2049122 scee will be in email contact with their psn audience very shortly

2049128 ich kann r ckl ufige quartalsergebnisse nicht v llig ausschlie en hoffe aber nicht dass es dazu kommen wird
2049129 habe ich mich schwer getan sie zu bekr ftigen nein
2049130 jawohl es wird eine weitere konsolidierung geben auch deshalb weil die bewertung in vielen f llen an einem punkt angekommen ist wo wieder ein bezug zur realit t vorhanden ist
2049131 in unserer industrie l uft im gro en wie im kleinen viel ab
2049132 weil unsere pipeline gut ist und weil wir aus eigener kraft heraus wachsen k nnen
2049133 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2049134 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2049135 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2049136 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2049137 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2049138 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2049139 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2049140 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2049141 they love to maul and enjoy the hit and go so its going to be a typically physical argentina test
2049142 but theyre also going to be the perfect test for us to get things 100 percent right before the tri nations matches
2049143 these poor people need to make plans for the rest of their lives too
2049144 they didnt make the case for the move or justify it
2049145 at this point i plan to vote no unless cgfa turns up information to suggest otherwise
2049146 i think the governors reasons for making this move dont add up
2049147 it would be much cheaper to stay in springfield and move into free vacant space
2049148 anyone who votes in favor of the move would be doing it just for the governor not based on anything presented at the hearing
2049149 in a perfect world wed have much more time to wade into this
2049150 i hope the governor will keep with tradition and follow our recommendation
2049151 if he doesnt then there will be a legal challenge
2049152 had planned a very organized and professional presentation people had changed their schedules to be able to be at this hearing
2049153 even in 200 years people will find completely new ways to create all within those rules and algorithms
2049154 i dont know in a way yes and in a way no
2049155 the last thing i want is someone to think oh they had to go back to puppets because that was the best album and theyre doing it because we want it if we start writing songs for our fans somethings gone wrong the fans may think they know best but hey im the armchair quarterback when im watching my team too at the end of the day we have to write it because we love it and its coming from our heart thats why people connect with it if you start doing it for the fans youve lost the plot
2049156 we recognize there was an essence there was a youth there was a something about that record and this is a perfect time for a record like this
2049157 because old school metal is huge and coming back and theres so many people wanting to play and get riffy again get solo i love that so with this record its like us starting over again
2049158 his mission statement was to get to the essence of metallica
2049159 what made sense to us was the hunger the quest to impress
2049160 he said youre going to write a set list your next album is a set list of your best songs and youre going to try and go get signed do a showcase and impress people and that was a great mission statement for us
2049161 its possible but we just go with our feelings every time
2049162 you cant go wrong if you go with your heart and thats pretty much it were very comfortable with our fanbase sorting itself out we dont have to make sure theyre happy because thats like trying to control the world you cant do it if people connect with what youre doing theyll be there if they dont like this record they might go away and thats ok that means theres a seat for someone else
2049163 we were looking at the past and seeing what worked for us and updating that sound
2049164 theres always been a melodic side to metallica a side that has been reflected in a desire to break free from any of those stereotypes and to just go where we could go musically and creatively
2049165 i think some of what weve done goes against a lot of the conservative elements in heavy metal and hard rock thinking and thats ok
2049166 listen were not in the toothpaste selling business its not about a product
2049167 the people who really relate to us they know we have this awkward some even call it perverse need to break free from stereotypes and to be able to go wherever we want and sometimes to a fault but at least its been a varied honest ride weve never bullsh ed anybody on a creative front but to be pigeonholed and held in to a particular thing people expect from you thats certainly not what im interested in
2049168 i am honored to congratulate the oswego community on this tremendous accomplishment this is truly one of our proudest moments
2049169 the compelling vision of a more powerful future for suny oswego has united alumni faculty staff students and the community from the start of the campaign and created a culture of giving and a new optimism on campus that ensures our continued drive for unparalleled excellence for generations to come
2049170 it was launched with a mock snowstorm a student showcase and more than 1 000 oswego students faculty and staff gathering on the lawn outside lee hall for a family portrait now six years after it originally began inspiring horizons the campaign for oswego has met its goal with the help of more than 22 000 generous donors
2049171 the forecast for suny oswego features excellence quality and distinction thanks to the success of inspiring horizons the campaign for oswego as honorary chair i want to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in raising 23 857 114 in this historic first campaign including president stanley our co chairs and volunteers the college faculty and staff and more than 22 000 of our loyal supporters
2049172 as an alumnus of suny oswego i couldnt be prouder of my alma mater for this tremendous accomplishment
2049173 without philanthropy we would not have the value added elements for this campus
2049174 donor gifts have also increased the number of scholarships for our students to make their dreams come true many of them just like me are the first in their families to attend college
2049175 i have been chair of the fund for oswego and have been in the telefund room when student callers are dialing up alumni
2049176 so i have felt the energy of the student callers their excitement at speaking with you and hearing your stories and the thrill when a gift is received
2049177 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2049178 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2049179 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2049180 the shots happened near the event across the street but it was close enough that it seemed as if it happened in the park where the show was taking place
2049181 its not clear what brought it on but police said the person shooting appeared to be shooting in the air
2049182 they shot in the air and took off running and we apprehended one and recovered one gun and the other suspect is still at large
2049183 but ross didnt want to leave his fans like that because some people had been there even before the event started
2049184 so he returned to the stage for a brief performance and then he went out into the audience to shake hands and sign autographs
2049185 you hear shots and you either get low or try to find yourself and people did that when they realized it was not in the park everyone returned to their areas hoping to see the rest of the show
2049186 the community comes together for a day of food fun and music from the boss and his celebrity friends all dedicated to promoting education and social responsibility
2049187 free food drinks and back to school supplies for the kids so bring the fam

2049197 i have applied for a concealed weapons license and im in the process of getting it
2049198 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2049199 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2049200 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2049201 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2049202 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2049203 its a little challenging to tour because you have to find a bathroom

2049212 it showed me that the mental health systems of support were not comprehensive enough to help people recover it didnt work for my dad and it didnt work for me
2049213 i agreed with the wording of the award because it said ive helped be a bridge between mental health providers and administrators and people who use the system
2049214 ive worked really hard to do a good job of that so i feel that i deserve the award
2049215 i was on a number of davids e mail lists
2049216 i particularly liked his quotes at the end we shared an interest in music so i loved his quotes because they usually were from 1960s and 70s rock and roll songs
2049217 what i really came to know and admire about him was his honesty and respect for people
2049218 he told it like he saw it and in a way that was forthright and respectful that was a really great skill
2049219 we dont want anyone to be disappointed by not being able to get the tickets they want
2049220 tickets for this years big kahuna are moving fast and everyone who wants to attend can buy their tickets in advance and just pick them up at the gate saving everyone the trips to the post office
2049221 i am personally concerned about both of these great causes

2049241 todays verdict has come as a result of that painstaking but ultimately very important good old fashioned detective work
2049242 from a relatively early point in the investigation it was clear that lindley was involved in the importation of a large quantity of cannabis
2049243 detectives from our high tech crime unit spent a considerable time examining computers seized from both defendants and found further highly incriminating evidence that helped to prove the conspiracy

2049263 consumer sentiment bounced back due to a moderation in the prices of gasoline and oil as well as a modest rebound in the equity markets
2049264 however the ongoing decline in house prices continued tight credit conditions and soft jobs market indicate that while sentiment might be in the process of bottoming at a very depressed level it has not likely begun an upward trend

2049290 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
2049291 the bottom line is that senator obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much and thats the problem in our nations capital today it is not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress
2049292 washington is full of talented talkers my friends and unfortunately on issues big and small what senator obama says and what he does are often two different things
2049293 he actually thinks that raising taxes on oil is going to bring down the price at the pump he is claiming that putting air in your tires is the equivalent is the equivalent of new offshore drilling that is not an energy plan my friends that is a public service announcement
2049294 i thought it was a good example of the fact that the other sides not serious about real energy savings that can push down the price of gas theyre interested in scoring political points as were speaking truthfully about what we need to do to meet our challenges
2049295 i spoke up against congress and the administration and when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
2049296 senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
2049297 senator obama says he will only raise taxes on the rich but in the senate he voted for tax hikes that would have impacted people making just 42 000 per year
2049298 senator obama thinks the way to keep jobs here at home is to make taxes higher raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs and send more jobs overseas
2049299 he actually thinks that raising taxes on oil is going to bring down the price at the pump
2049300 he is claiming that putting air in your tires is the equivalent is the equivalent of new offshore drilling
2049301 senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
2049302 senator obama says he will only raise taxes on the rich but in the senate he voted for tax hikes that would have impacted people making just 42 000 per year
2049303 proposal to reduce energy costs in the u s will not work unless we also simultaneously curb u s population growth by reducing immigration and curbing teen pregnancies
2049304 true friendship can afford true knowledge it does not depend on darkness and ignorance
2049305 you know we are going to correct that this week hopefully with your help
2049306 we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine that folks need a break from politics and they didnt really get one like they normally do
2049307 john mccain got one but i think that the majority of people have been fed a constant stream of political chatter and im sure that having a couple weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2049308 i couldnt go last year so its been about 19 months since i saw her and shes at an age where its really important for me to see her and those little girls need a little love as does michelle i think so were going to take some time
2049309 be unconditionally loved and take a break from politics as compared with mr mccain who divorced
2049310 we will release a full schedule of who is speaking but the notion that a former president just got added to the convention schedule is a little bit i think laughable idea
2049311 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2049312 in sub saharan africa where more than 90 per cent of malaria deaths occur children and pregnant women are simultaneously infected with both malaria and a group of other parasitic diseases known as the neglected tropical diseases
2049313 its going to be a hard time if they do shut it down completely
2049314 hopefully well have some decisions reached by then but theyre still working on another avenue
2049315 as far as i know they government had an electrician or someone go in but i dont know much more than you
2049316 im not arguing with the fact they feel theyve got to shut me down but the timing of it
2049317 ive got no warning they come in one day out of the blue and say this is over
2049318 i didnt even argue with the boys government put this here for the people originally and they walked away from it im trying to keep it running for them
2049319 i wanted to get working to keep it as a facility for the public
2049320 then electrical inspector comes along and says youre not up to code with your wiring so weve got to shut you down right in the middle of summer they could have waited until september and let me bow out gracefully its stupid
2049321 he had the wires not only through the trees but he had connecting wires out on the grass so that was a severe safety hazard we said he had to bring that up to code
2049322 its not up to code its a life safety issue its a dangerous situation
2049323 if i gave a week and something happens well guess what the buck stops at my desk it cant happen
2049324 flatwater park needs your help make your voice known its election time in this area and make your voice known you want this turned into the modern facility this area deserves
2049325 gonzalo rubalcaba 28 year old cuban pianist thiss his first recording outside cuba lissen to what he does with well you neednt
2049326 the one thing that theyre looking for is larger accounts that they can clean out
2049327 they havent automated the money transfer part of the process so theyre looking for the biggest accounts to get the most money the quickest
2049328 and thats a conservative estimate of what they could get
2049329 this was only a fraction of the accounts they had stolen
2049330 the fact that theyve been in operation for over six years shows theres not a whole lot of risk to them
2049331 but we need a lot more effort and cooperation to do anything about this
2049332 se i valori in cui crediamo sono universali come lidea di persona e della vita umana il concetto di giustizia e di pace non possono certo diventare confini che ci dividono irrimediabilmente
2049333 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances

2049335 they are inter related affect both rich and poor and require all of us to do our part
2049336 we need to uphold the trust that was forged in first agreeing to the mdgs developed and developing countries made commitments to each other as did governments and their citizens failure to meet these pledges or at least to improve significantly on the gains to date would be a terrible blow with widespread implications for our shared humanity
2049337 over the long term we need to reduce agricultural subsidies in developed countries reverse the deplorable downward trend in agricultures share of official development assistance reverse years of under investment in agriculture and rural development and successfully conclude the doha round of global trade negotiations
2049338 we also need enlightened leadership in particular from the industrialized countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities
2049339 a typical indian gamer is a city bred youth who has no idea about traditional indian games

2049344 this is promising news for july august existing home sales as the pending sales figures become an existing home sale a month or two down the road assuming theyre not cancelled
2049345 despite the unexpected surge in pending home sales in june with most other housing related indicators pointing downward there is little to suggest an imminent abatement in the u s housing market correction
2049346 we doubt sales of non foreclosed homes are rising given the recent rise in mortgage rates and continued price declines still anything which reduces inventory whether of foreclosed homes or not is a very welcome development
2049347 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009

2049353 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2049354 it is critical that everyone know the risk for your area and have a plan to protect yourself your family and your property or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season
2049355 even people who live inland should be prepared for severe weather and flooding from a tropical storm or a hurricane
2049356 i am deeply concerned about the central new york economy and honeywells announcement to send nearly 300 jobs overseas is alarming and harmful to this community of hardworking new yorkers
2049357 it is unclear if the state of new york or the people of skaneateles falls were given a chance to make their case but it is very clear that the workers whose jobs are on the line deserve to be heard
2049358 tomorrow i will send a letter to the ceo of honeywell requesting a meeting to discuss how and why this decision was made what can be done to secure an alternative to this drastic decision and honeywells long term plan for the 250 jobs that remain at the skaneateles facility

2049403 this is so big and so well planned that neither copenhagen nor denmark can carry out something similar the olympic games are simply an event that is too big for a country of five million inhabitants
2049404 after the games in athens four years ago many thought of copenhagen as host city of an olympic games but after what i have seen here in beijing i have to say it is out of the question
2049405 they were such nice guys down to earth they never bothered anybody and thats why im so shocked about this happening to them
2049406 obviously its a sad thing when things like this happen especially to a family and two family members being killed
2049407 and just looking at the nature of the crime that he is being accused naturally we want to capture him and talk to him

2049409 we in the peoples national congress recognize him burnham as a visionary who was a founding father of an independent guyana his vision was to establish an egalitarian society where all races would enjoy social justice and political and economic emancipation
2049410 i believe that guyana has nowhere to go and has no realistic chance of revitalization without peace and reconciliation a peace that is based on justice and a recognition of the rights and aspirations of all guyanese whatever their ethnic or racial origins or whatever the social background and religious beliefs this indeed was part of the vision of l f s burnham
2049411 if guyana is to move forward there must be a paradigm shift we cannot continue in this vicious cycle for cohesion to be achieved we have to close the chapter of the past let us have a truth and reconciliation commission
2049412 he was a failure he was a success he was a builder he was a destroyer he was a strategist he was a schemer
2049413 due recognition to the service of mr burnham to the national assembly and guyana by requesting the government to have prepared and published a collection of his speeches spanning his tenure in the national assembly for display in the library of the national assembly
2049414 calls on the government to designate a state institution to be responsible for historical research and documentation to chronicle and archive all of the works of each of the presidents of guyana for the benefit of future generations of guyanese

2049421 it was a great example of everything weve been practicing
2049422 the change of momentum the big plays theyre things we are trying to reinforce on a daily basis
2049423 he put both balls in the perfect spot for me to catch
2049424 it was a heck of a catch and hopefully we have a lot more of those coming
2049425 i threw it where i intended maybe a little bit back but i knew he can get those weve been working on that play
2049426 after the interception he came back and drove down the field for a score thats what you want to see

2049430 the defendants are essentially proposing that i exercise federal jurisdiction given the unsettled nature of the law in this area i decline their offer
2049431 laudable concern about potential conflicts of interest in an ongoing criminal investigation
2049432 appellants have not been charged with a crime nor have grand jury proceedings been initiated against them nor have they been called to appear as grand jury witnesses
2049433 alleged potential conflict of interest existed only in the context of an ongoing criminal investigation monitored and supervised by the fbi which is independent and separate from any proceeding occurring before the district court
2049434 accordingly the district courts inherent authority was an improper basis to assert jurisdiction over the governments motion to disqualify
2049435 both the state bar of texas and the western district of texas have grievance procedures whereby an attorney can be charged with unethical conduct and appropriate proceedings under the applicable rules can transpire
2049436 i would say that he the judge doesnt have a role in even having an opinion about whom can represent whom when the case is not yet in his court
2049437 there is probably a sigh of relief going through many defense attorneys and clients in el paso because there are plenty of other lawyers i think in my position representing more than one person who may be involved with this investigation
2049438 he said it was very emotional as he picked it up and placed it back tenderly
2049439 he said it was very emotional as he picked it up and placed it back tenderly
2049440 i think the crisis we had in the early 90s was worse i dont think people are ready to start jumping out of buildings like they did in the 20s

2049442 theres a court mandate there so i dont see based on a court mandate where you reduce that
2049443 i dont think school aid is intended just for new york city
2049444 the governor has to participate with the legislature he has to present us with bills to act on
2049445 id also like to thank and congratulate the other seven candidates
2049446 it was a solid field and a wide array of candidates with different backgrounds each one had something to bring to the table
2049447 all were doing right now is having some organizational meetings and looking forward to that event

2049450 at the end of 2005 the new chairman of brunswick the large us corporation that bought navman indicated he didnt think vehicle tracking was core
2049451 head office is in chicago where a small team including the president cfo and ceo perform financial functions its also where prairie has its headquarters so its logical we should be there
2049452 navman has always been something of a hero brand down here and our part of the business has always been a jewel in the navman crown however were a business to business player rather than a commoditised consumer player
2049453 were growing strongly though were probably the greatest success story to come out of the break up of navman were in a very good position to drive our own roadmap better than before to understand what opportunities and market we have and to build on those opportunities
2049454 in new zealand weve just passed 10 000 connections we certainly are the leading player in the new zealand automatic vehicle location market globally in the uk australia the us europe south america were selling fast and are either in the top three or are ramping up very fast in the us we arent the leader yet but we are rising fast we expect to turn over about 100 million this year

2049457 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
2049458 once again buscape has developed a customized tool to offer zaps users an efficient search for online shopping prices and products the partnership with zap will help the large number of consumers who access the site looking for the best offers

2049461 in sydney we had a blast in athens i didnt have as much fun because she wasnt there it completes everything for me to have her here
2049462 im working on just getting better and everything is going to be looking good
2049463 in the olympics the singles and the doubles are the same because a gold medal is a gold medal
2049464 theyre always tough to play against because theyre powerful even though theyre not really quite doing doubles movements
2049465 at the net theyre just standing there instead of moving or crossing or poaching but theyre tall and their quality of serves and strokes is great
2049466 growing up it was like wimbledon the u s open and winning grand slams but when i did win that gold medal its definitely my best trophy i have by far im like carl lewis and jackie joyner kersee and thinking of all these wonderful athletes that did win olympic gold medals youre one of the few that have and it was really cool
2049467 it has been beyond my dreams to play the olympics
2049468 but there are crazy people who are and im just afraid for the safety of his wife and kids
2049469 we really thought that nice would approve this drug the decision is an absolute blow for other people
2049470 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
2049471 if these treatments were provided on the nhs other patients would lose out on treatments that are both clinically and cost effective
2049472 you think back to the military to my marine corps days thats all it is no foo foo stuff
2049473 i used to do two a day three a day my record was 52 one summer might be a record for high school boys
2049474 we anticipate we could have as many as 2 000 additional families coming for assistance this year
2049475 im still alive and relatively well i have commentary photos and a dive log to prove it
2049476 whatever i have in my personal computer is also on some of my private blogs not assessable by others and i can access them where ever i happen to be
2049477 though these days blogging is as easy as signing in for email account and operating it yet those who are gifted with writing skills are often web novice and those who are skilful internet users have nothing much to say
2049478 i started blogging because i have an opinion and i wanted to have a place where i could voice my views about things around moreover every one else was having one in my circle writing is very daunting job sometimes the stress of daily updates became a distraction in my work and i left it after doing it for a year
2049479 you mention me in your blog and i mention you in mine
2049480 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb

2049485 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair colour
2049486 the current level of negotiations is still at the stage of learning positions there is no justification for drawing any conclusions or developing any visions based on mere fancy under such circumstances we believe that the discussions are a mere process of enquiry that remains within a general and theoretical framework israeli prevarications continue to impose themselves on the situation
2049487 can no longer bear a state of war without war which leads to psychological and social instability and disturbs the economy and development
2049488 we are in a transitional stage in all meanings of the word between the bush cheney stage and what follows it between the olmert stage and what follows it and between two approaches to dealing with the syrian authorities the first approach sees syria as undesirable and the second accepts it in the game of regional nations this transition has made us believe that olmert is opening up the syrian file in order to lessen the pressure on his domestic file in turn the syrian government is lessening its losses in the time gained by waiting for 2009
2049489 direct negotiations might not begin until after the new american president assumes his duties at the beginning of the new year for the current american administration is not interested in the peace process
2049490 syria has sufficient desire to move the negotiations from the indirect stage to the direct stage and it wants the united states to play a major and public role in those negotiations but none of this has yet taken place and there is not yet enough of a basis to move the discussions to a direct form there are no major topics clearly agreed upon and israel has not settled on any way of applying the resolutions of the international community and fully withdrawing from the golan heights
2049491 it is necessary to continue peace efforts without prior conditions
2049492 some family members are hoping to meet up with the expedition leader of gers team wilco van rooijen
2049493 at high altitude at over 8000 metres it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
2049494 our mission statement has changed somewhat since we put together our first business plan
2049495 at the start we wanted this to be a label based on singer songwriters whose vibe was stripped down and acoustic but the more things evolved the more it made sense to open the roster to include a wider range of artists and styles
2049496 mack has a big heart and he just got a new heart so were just trying to give back
2049497 you know paris hiltons energy plan doesnt sound half bad
2049498 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
2049499 stealing from each other how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
2049500 the e u should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a euro atlantic area of cooperation with the united states in the field of freedom security and justice
2049501 a country that in privacy terms is all but lawless u s privacy laws are weak they offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non citizens
2049502 maximum information flow between e u member states is guaranteed
2049503 relevant security related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states
2049504 for some reason the girls also had the same feeling
2049505 i have no control over where the lightning will hit
2049506 we could hardly move our hands they were turning purple and blue
2049507 it was scary ive never really been in something like that before
2049508 they said there had been awful snow wind and sleet
2049509 there has been interest shown but he played well and i am pleased with him
2049510 there will always be speculation surrounding good players like him
2049511 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2049512 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2049513 what is a windfall profit anyway how does it differ from your everyday run of the mill profit is it some absolute number a matter of return on equity or sales or does it merely depend on who earns it
2049514 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
2049515 this extraordinary redefinition of free market success could use some parsing
2049516 simply means punishing the successful and redistributing their wealth by government fiat its a euphemism for socialism
2049517 in the past such rhetoric was just that rhetoric but obamas positioning himself with alarming stealth to put that rhetoric into action on a scale not seen since the birth of the welfare state
2049518 we have won the case as the court has ordered a permanent injunction on the scenes which mock the actor now we are planning for a criminal case
2049519 we will be filing the case against the makers of the movie monday under sections 499 and 500 which says defaming a person advertently either through words print movies or any other medium is a criminal offence
2049520 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2049521 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2049522 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2049523 this innovative scavenger hunt enables us to reward our target audience and give them a direct call to action to go see
2049524 it is great to win and great to qualify for the final though the match was played in extremely difficult conditions the most important factor for our victory was the immense desire to win shown by the boys sunil chhetri was the example he played with stitches on his forehead and still scored a goal by a header
2049525 ideally we wanted a match decided by football factors but the conditions were the same for both the teams the poor ground conditions should not deprive the boys the credit for the victory they deserve to win
2049526 he missed at least two clear chances and i am happy he got the winner he played with stitches on his forehead and still he scored a goal he showed lots of character and that is the sign of a good player
2049527 that was a difficult first half we wanted to finish it as soon as possible and come back stronger in the second half but the ground conditions worsened we came through finally though
2049528 it is a big day for the team and for me and we are one game away from reaching the 2011 asian cup
2049529 if we qualify we will be among 16 best teams in asia we want to do well in the tournament and will have two and half years time to prepare for the tournament
2049530 this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery
2049531 i have no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the security council
2049532 we are at a fairly early stage in this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to some targeted sanctions whether they be in the energy sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance and other financial areas which we would look at if we were looking to increase pressure on the iranian leadership
2049533 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2049534 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2049535 feeling safe is brought up at assembly we dont tolerate any bullying the kids are encouraged to tell teachers
2049536 kids know if they do anything wrong there are consequences
2049537 were just less tolerant of it now and thats a good thing we create a school environment which doesnt allow bullying or anti social behaviours
2049538 you can have an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff or you can have resources at the top
2049539 the focus is learning creating an environment so learning takes place
2049540 id like to think the kids that come out of here will be contributing citizens
2049541 bombing the inner city with vibrant stitched works of art wrapped around everything from beer bottles on easy nights to public monuments and utility poles on more ambitious outings

2049543 the legend of the invisible village of the cayuga indians
2049544 young people are creating their own youth communities and gangs in search of the influences that could once have been found in traditional communities
2049545 all the threads that hold a community together a common identity role models a sense of safety were given by young people as a motivation to join gangs
2049546 weve taken the advice of the bbpa and decided not to have minimum pricing
2049547 the cheapest we have is about 1 80 for a drink at wetherspoons
2049548 im pleased that the licensees arent operating minimum pricing any more we hope they will continue to act responsibly around promotions
2049549 this is just a start we hope to be able to serve all parts of the city in subsequent phases
2049550 we need to do three to four more years of engineering and those are going to answer a lot of questions that we still dont have enough information on
2049551 because of gas prices youre going to see a big change in the number of trains carrying passengers around the country
2049552 we did not feel safe with her acting that way
2049553 this is great news for all of the people we have met at shows across the country
2049554 everywhere we exhibit our new water people want to know where to buy it we are so new that we are just developing relationships with stores so it has been difficult to get our water to customers now everyone can get convenient home delivery
2049555 the 1 question at the new york show was if we could deliver our water to the residents of new york some people live in walk ups and cant carry cases of water to their apartments and condos now they can order our water and have it delivered to their home
2049556 now people can order our water delivered and soon we will be distributed in stores across the country launching a new product takes time and this speeds up our plans
2049557 reports show that disease cannot survive in an alkaline state so people that are very health conscious are appreciative that park city icewater is alkaline water
2049558 and it is fun to drink just twist off the lid and squeeze at one of our celebrity shows someone suggested a new slogan just squeeze it
2049559 we were in a situation where we were in the red in the month our donations had fallen well below our expenses and we couldnt run like that forever we had to turn things around before it did get into a serious situation
2049560 its a step forward that we needed we have had a problem and this money is half what we need to operate for one month thats a big help for us
2049561 one of my dogs came from the humane society he was abandoned by my neighbor i came here and there he was
2049562 this is not the end we still need monthly donations we survive on 5 10 and 25 donations from people across the community
2049563 a place where people of all ages could enjoy a mocha latte or cappuccino specially prepared by well trained baristas while watching fox news on the big screen televisions or while surfing the internet on the free wi fi
2049564 our colombian decaf is our liberal and i always say thats because it has no substance and then i have a moderate blend which is our guatemalan and i have a conservative blend which is our kenyan and then our strongest roast is our radical right sumatran blend so they progressively get stronger up the line
2049565 who support sustainable agriculture using only the highest quality hand picked organic arabica beans
2049566 we all know how important computer skills and the internet are to gaining access to educational resources in the global economy
2049567 with this generous contribution from at amp t a great many disadvantaged children in tennessee will now be able to reach the tools they need for future success in their lives
2049568 the best site on the world wide web although she could cut some of that crazy music she listens to
2049569 this site is not bigger due to lack of access to big piles of money
2049570 in a sense i have no choice but to believe in this vision of america as a child of a black man and a white woman someone who was born in the racial melting pot of hawaii with a sister who is half indonesian but whos usually mistaken for mexican or puerto rican and a brother in law and niece of chinese descent with some blood relatives who resemble margaret thatcher and others who could pass for bernie mac ive never had the option of restricting my loyalties on the basis of race or measuring my worth on the basis of tribe
2049571 we need stronger enforcement on the border but for reform to work we must also respond to what pulls people to america where we can reunite families we should where we can bring in more foreign workers with the skills our economy needs we should
2049572 you always tell me that if youre going to come from my cock you have to start on top so i want you to ride me

2049575 in terms of maximizing impact and joining forces to control the epidemic this merger is an innovative and bold move
2049576 this is the sort of consolidation i believe we will see more of in the future across the aids sector
2049577 bringing together a substantial country presence with an increased information exchange dialogue and advocacy capacity will facilitate more coherent civil society voices and mobilization around aids and related priorities such as tb
2049578 in terms of maximizing impact and joining forces to control the epidemic this merger is an innovative and bold move
2049579 this is the sort of consolidation i believe we will see more of in the future across the aids sector
2049580 understanding and being committed to greater impact requires ngos and other types of organizations to honestly examine how they can be most effective
2049581 the alliance and hdn see this ambition as more important than preserving established organizational identities
2049582 this shifting environment means organizations need to adopt higher standards of accountability respond to stricter reporting requirements and communicate better with critical and well informed stakeholders the planned joint organization will strive to develop a reputation for transparency and providing reliable information about its work
2049583 i am out for a month so it is gutting for me not to be able to start the season especially as i have had a great pre season and worked really hard
2049584 but it wont affect me too much in terms of working through the rehabilitation for this injury and to get back better than before again
2049585 i have probably had the best pre season ever and i think i have shown that i proved my point in that i totally recovered from my injury last year and have returned fitter and stronger like i said i would
2049586 i wanted to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact

2049589 the best way to deal with an enemy is to turn him into a friend
2049590 i hate when im having a moment of reflection and i am in a quiet mood and someone asks me if im crabby and when i say no they argue why did you ask if you already had an answer even if it was the wrong one
2049591 the curatorial staff felt is was important to only release works with vetted data while there are all kinds of arguments both for and against this kind of thinking we felt it was important to honor their wishes records will move out more slowly but it also means the data will be in good shape when it does and thats a good thing
2049592 is this my only reminder of something i need to know or do
2049593 we have a lot to show to the world only three countries in europe have such a strong culture those are italy greece bulgaria and a small part of macedonia i am referring to ancient rome thrace and the ancient history we really have exceptional things to show
2049594 the collection of the national museum of history nmh contains more than 600 000 historical artefacts so we can pride ourselves as a country on historical cultural artefacts that we would like to show to people who come here as tourists so they wont
2049595 if were speaking about sveti vlas within the next two years a large part of the complexes will be finished complete with infrastructure new roads pavements and street lights of course everything will be well maintained and well managed this will be a truly luxurious destination and i can see this is already happening you can see the cars that are parked out here there is a fortune in cars parked here already
2049596 the idea that we with bozhidar dimitrov have is to change or try a different direction in tourism not so much middlebrow but more directed towards cultural heritage people come here for the sun and everything else we offer as a tourist destination but while they are here it would be good to show them who we are as people as a nation we are working in that direction
2049597 for the first time in bulgaria we have managed to set up an exhibition outside the walls of museums in the palace hotel in marina dinevi here in sveti vlas with artefacts from the closed collection of the nmh
2049598 our registration was awarded registration number five we were one of the first five who were interested in protecting and promoting bulgarian cultural heritage and the possibility to promote this heritage worldwide
2049599 we have not registered to reduce our taxes maybe that is our mistake i dont even know the details of the financial aspects of the law i have no idea we dont have this practice as a foundation as a company
2049600 our foundation built a monument three years ago for those who fell in the fight against world wide terrorism that was in karlovo where the 61st brigade prepared for their mission in iraq later on we were told by former us ambassador john beyrle that it was the first monument of its kind worldwide not even in the us had a similar monument been built
2049601 we follow an old tradition not only bulgarian but general european it is normal for rich people who can afford it to give to society
2049602 like every normal foundation in the world through our sponsorship we support the needs of culture we do the same for our traditions as other european foundations do for theirs
2049603 all these things are inseparably connected this year we started a boat charter business anyone who wants to rent a boat to go to varna sozopol or balchik or even to turkey or greece can do that we have a wide choice of new boats including sailboats and motorboats including some where the engine hasnt even been started
2049604 a number of new marinas are in the planning stages so within a few years there will be many more good destinations then between balchik and tsarevo we can have 10 or 12 or even 15 marinas where yachts can dock this is the main reason why the black sea is not yet a well known destination for sailors
2049605 i have friends whom we meet in different ports in greece italy or turkey who dont come exactly for that reason i think that this will change in two to three years
2049606 yachts are an old hobby we have had an interest in yachts and boats our entire life
2049607 were a good duo maybe i have a bit more of an artistic personality we complement one another hes a serious mathematician theoretician while im more involved in the idea phase of future developments
2049608 there are no other differences we dont differ much in age and weve grown up together were not from different generations or with a large age difference to have a different view on the problems of this country
2049609 again we follow a tradition sailing which in bulgaria had decayed during the last 60 years it was very difficult for anyone to own a boat because you might use it to cross lines you were not supposed to cross like the shared border with turkey for example so for political reasons it was forbidden and we were cut off from feeling like a seafaring nation which we have been for 1300 years now the tradition has returned and new generations of sailors have appeared
2049610 while the jdp was facing closure we supported it and were prepared to wait
2049611 but now that the case has finished and it has been allowed to stay open we believe that we have the right to begin criticising it again for not trying hard enough to lift the ban
2049612 the original maverick while now conducting a more traditional campaign senior adviser mark salter admits its a new strategy
2049613 its the nfl now we have to up our game a little bit
2049614 i know you could take your business elsewhere and i appreciate you sticking with us
2049615 this has been on my mind 24 7 for the last three years it was emotionally and financially draining and it took a pretty big toll on our company
2049616 i was actually quite shocked that it ended that quickly
2049617 this was a true david and goliath battle this is a huge win for the little guy and a huge win for our industry
2049618 if progressive could do this to greg they can do it to anyone
2049619 after 15 years of wreck check post repair inspections i have about seen it all
2049620 this mercedes was an exception in that it was repaired as close to original as humanly possible right down to the texture of the vinyl coating texture on the underside of the floor after examination and review of the pleadings it didnt take long to see greg was being singled out as progressives whipping boy
2049621 with our strategic alliance with z corporation we have expanded our solutions portfolio and we are determined to provide maximum value to our customers based on this association we intend to address other high potential segments like medical packaging metal casting consumer goods architecture education amp research
2049622 there are certainly similarities in the two homicides the one is lake park ga and the one here in columbia county but further investigation shows it is highly unlikely daymon heard is responsible for the shooting death of mrs linda raulerson on july 22
2049623 our detectives have spent countless hours interviewing family and friends to determine if he might be our suspect but the pieces are simply not fitting together to complete this puzzle
2049624 today we remain partners with the people of tanzania and kenya and i witnessed the spirit of that partnership when i visited both kenya and tanzania earlier this year
2049625 secure new embassies have now been built in nairobi and dar es salaam reflecting the enduring strength of these relationships bombs and bullets and terror can never and will never break our bond
2049626 the bombings of our embassies seemed merely to be the senseless violence of evil men an organization called al qaida when seen from today however 10 years later after the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 the attack on khobar towers in 1996 the attack on the uss cole in 2000 and of course the terror of september 11 we now see those bombings of our embassies in nairobi and dar es salaam in a new light we see them as they were as the opening of a new twilight struggle between hope and fear peace and hatred freedom and tyranny a struggle that has now finally fully been joined
2049627 brutal examples of tactics in its war against innocent people worldwide carried out in the heart of two african capitals without regard to the race creed or nationality of the victims
2049628 this has been method for more than a decade indiscriminately attacking civilians throughout the world
2049629 the attacks in kenya and tanzania remind us that al qaida and its terrorist affiliates continue to want to attack the united states and our allies
2049630 reinforces the need to confront the terrorists to work with our allies to bring them to justice and to prevent such attacks from happening again
2049631 these unprovoked attacks by a hitherto largely unknown terrorist group called al qaida galvanized the united states kenya tanzania and countries throughout the world to undertake cooperative coordinated efforts to fight terrorism
2049632 today we recommit ourselves to preserve the memory of all the victims we reaffirm our determination to bring those responsible to justice and we rededicate ourselves to advance democracy and prosperity for all people
2049633 i am pleased to pass the chief executive officer position to sardar who has demonstrated an incredible work ethic and dedication to the company since his election to the board as chairman he has shown that he is willing and able to lead the company through its turnaround process and i believe he is the right chief executive officer to lead steak n shake into the future
2049634 i would like to thank wayne for his guidance over the last several months in reviewing steak n shake and beginning to implement its restructuring the board and i concluded that to achieve the best results we need an executive who will be focused on restaurant operations as a consequence we will seek a president with significant restaurant experience to concentrate on improving restaurant operations whereas i will assume the ceo position leading the organization principally from a strategic financial and governance perspective concurrently we are presently undergoing a comprehensive examination of the company and are in the process of implementing a restructuring program closing underperforming locations reducing g amp a shortening hours of operation in many locations and other initiatives all on the premise that steak n shake will be managed based on cash flows in order to create long term value for shareholders steak n shake is an iconic brand with greatly talented people working throughout the organization because of all these advantages i am confident we will regain the chains prior status as a great company details of our plan will be disclosed within the next 60 days in a shareholder letter
2049635 with rampant illegal logging vague logging concession boundaries and massive blocks of pristine forest destined for the chainsaw this is a laudable step towards avoiding an ecological disaster
2049636 while the certified forests will have to be maintained according to acceptable international standards there is urgent need for other timber business operations in the region to adopt responsible forest management practices in order to ensure the conservation of this unique forest ecosystem for the benefit of people in the region and the world
2049637 illegal forest exploitation and forest crimes are largely due to poor governance and insufficient law enforcement
2049638 wwf also recognizes that responsible forest management plays an important role in the economic growth of tropical countries and reducing poverty in forest communities
2049639 wwf is convinced that the adoption of responsible forestry schemes by logging companies will contribute greatly to the conservation of the congo basin forests and towards improving the national economy and also improve the livelihoods of local communities
2049640 for the success of responsible forestry in the congo basin there is a high need for government to set up enabling conditions that include enacting adequate legislation and enforcement and promoting good governance while providing support to responsible forestry initiatives
2049641 the organization is and generally has failed the worlds forests
2049642 especially given the recent transformation of consoles from historically teen focused gaming devices to now becoming family entertainment hubs in many living rooms across the globe we are very focused on titles that satisfy this new broad demographic
2049643 we enjoyed working with gameshastra on tumblebugs 2 pc and are excited to collaborate again to bring our games to the emerging realm of console casual gaming the broad consumer appeal and high production values of wildfires titles make them a natural fit for the console space
2049644 after working closely with the wildfire team to create background art for tumblebugs 2 we realized the game was a fantastic wiiware candidate
2049645 the key to a successful wii port is the ability to expand the title to take advantage of the unique wiimote input system and we feel we have came up with a very innovative design that combines the regular shoot to match 3 experience with some very unique wii specific mechanics
2049646 i can tell you from years of experience that this business requires ongoing servicing for as long as the clients are in the program for clients that stay in the program the time comes when they start paying off smaller accounts after lets say 2 years those accounts have to be removed from the program and the funds that were being disbursed to the paid in full accounts need to be applied to remaining accounts
2049647 i could go on and on with examples of the continuing service requirements but it all boils down to properly servicing clients for as long as they are in the program
2049648 the rain just came it was incredible it was like a waterfall off the back porch roof and i looked out at the road and it was just like whoosh coming down
2049649 i have the experience that ive often heard about and read about is when you see how fast and furious water is when it moves i saw it this afternoon out here on towne hill road one of the highest points in montpelier
2049650 this is one of our drainage areas that we needed to improve a little bit just around the culvert and we had done a lot of that work already and what was done was undone during this storm
2049651 this was a substantial storm and by the sounds of it it may not be over yet
2049652 we need to stabilize a lot of different areas and the problem is a lot of these areas are already washed out so theyre compromised theyre more susceptible to erosion and if we get any more substantial rain theres going to be more damage no question
2049653 something not taken into account in previous races contributed to the performances
2049654 the issue is half a million swimmers feeling forced into purchasing 500 plus swimsuits in order to be competitive
2049655 if all athletes are wearing these new suits then whats the point
2049656 all we have done is artificially elevate performances across the board the new suits are only effective if only some athletes have access to them
2049657 if the suits make a 10 percent or even a 2 percent difference as predicted by the manufacturer its phenomenally fast when compared to annual improvements of much less than 1 percent
2049658 what this forces you to do is to start asking how fast would mark spitz have gone in 1972 how fast would jim montgomery have gone in 1976 if they would have had one of these suits it places all the previous records sort of out of context
2049659 i know its hard to believe i like them the damage ive done to some but im sure theres some root to the psychosis in that too
2049660 at this time she noticed me and said hey didnt i see you drive past earlier
2049661 i had gotten off scenic onto airline and we just were going over the bridge you know
2049662 the tie thing and then i looked at her and i looked at it and i looked at her next thing you know im walking around the car with it and she looks up
2049663 then she stands up so its like perfect in the right spot and its like wrong direction and a couple minutes two or three minutes later um that was the end of her

2049671 i understand we cant hold 1 000 dogs here every year but two out of 12 000 theyve become very special to me thats all there is to it theyve gotten me through the days
2049672 none of the commissioners want to see any animals euthanized that dont have to be
2049673 we cant keep every dog that comes through no one wants to have to put them down but its a harsh reality
2049674 we dont feel we should be keeping the dogs there as pets there are two dogs taking up space that another dog is being euthanized for so who do you save
2049675 we are trying to do the right thing but in something like this there will always be someone who doesnt like what you are doing
2049676 we are trying to be prudent with taxpayers money the pound is there for a function not for housing pets
2049677 if no owner for the captured dog is located the dog must be harbored for a minimum of three days
2049678 its understood that after three days the dog may be destroyed if not adopted out

2049684 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground

2049687 this project builds on the previous barbados hiv aids program which successfully increased access to testing treatment and care
2049688 the new project will further expand its impact by increasing knowledge and effective sustainable behavior change required to ensure hiv prevention and control
2049689 this event exposes the worst aspects of the ngo involvement in the conflict officials of ism icahd and pchr are selfish publicists and fringe ideologues and those who fund them are complicit instead of providing actual aid to gaza like genuine humanitarian organizations they have shown that they value hatred over assistance
2049690 this is not a review of competition between london and new york city
2049691 it is an assessment of how the two cities can use their competitive instincts to be successful in the 21st century when many other cities will seek to emulate the success london and new york had in the last 100 years
2049692 they were considered to have this great regulatory system with the financial services authority but it is clear now it just didnt work with northern rock
2049693 so much of the financial business conducted in london is from new york firms citigroup morgan stanley goldman sachs
2049694 new york has the edge in terms of total numbers of global firms
2049695 although differences in arms laws have long resulted in greater gun crime in new york the gap between the cities is lessening as new york improves its statistics whilst gun crime in london is on the increase
2049696 most respondents felt they knew more about london than any other city by a wide margin london was the second most visited city the top for ease of finding a job for doing business in for obtaining a valuable education qualification and for ease of finding a community to fit in
2049697 this discrepancy undoubtedly reflects the subjective and qualitative nature of measuring image and identity
2049698 if you dont go to the great wall then youre not a real man
2049699 its appropriate for a soldier to start the torch relay for the great wall leg because the great wall is a symbol of china and a symbol of the peoples liberation army
2049700 this is the first time china is holding the olympics so i personally wanted to come and see the torch
2049701 wendy is a girls name but hamburger is a boys name so we dont order hamburgers just chicken nuggets because we are girls and we dont like yucky things that are for boys
2049702 mcdonalds is a grandmas name because that is where grandmas take you mommies dont because it is just too pensive
2049703 ooooo kay why is grandma heigh ho like snow white is it because she has lots of woodland creatures in her yard
2049704 god is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and he gives them to whoever he chooses even the lowliest of men
2049705 did i make the right decision to end up where i am at
2049706 god what do you want to teach me and how do you want to use me where i am
2049707 we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much abu nabaa solicited
2049708 the 2004 opinion is very clear but throwing the regulation into the mix muddies the water the fec could revisit the issue
2049709 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2049710 as well as building compulsory literacy and numeracy papers into our early years degrees we will incorporate management components also many teachers based within early childhood centres find themselves in management roles and it is a significant demand particularly on those with no formal qualifications or training in management
2049711 we offer a high quality of teacher education at massey we teach face to face on campus as well as on line through web based tools which provide discussions virtual classrooms and a sense of community that works well for people who cant commit to campus
2049712 what would happen if we shifted media consumption even by 5 to stories of possibility
2049713 we are eager to build our boeing fleet with these additional 737s and 767s to meet continued demand for air travel in our region
2049714 this order is yet another step forward in our strong relationship with boeing we look forward to operating the 787 and benefiting from its advanced performance features however the 767 300er is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity targets
2049715 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2049716 it seems to me a legitimate and not too rude a subject to bring up in the campaign
2049717 on monday i paid 3 50 for a pint now all of a sudden its 3 90
2049718 they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices there is no price list on the wall i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2049719 given the allegations made the council will be seeking to speak to the licensee
2049720 for seven years i was doing research on vibration dampening and i was about to give up until rambler expressed interest
2049721 it turned out that baie verte the mine at rambler needed drills and i sell rock drills they put the order in for them but i couldnt supply them for about three months
2049722 however i had one drill that had a vibration dampener on it i told the ground superintendent mr don seymour that i would give him that drill he asked why i had it so i told him that this drill reduces the vibration injury to the user
2049723 i didnt follow it up that much on it because i had other testers in other mines that lost the drill or they just didnt pay too much attention however the guys in newfoundland did
2049724 all the hand drills used by the miners now have the vibration dampener on them
2049725 they were the first mine in canada to do that and pay attention to what i was doing
2049726 rambler mine took that drill in to reduce the injury to the miner and since then there has been a real interest in the drill and its dampening technology
2049727 its common that the vibration causes secondary reynaud syndrome and carpal tunnel
2049728 the drill platform also transmits vibrations to the lower extremities of the human body which is not accepted by the compensation board
2049729 het geld is niet alleen maar bestemd voor allochtone kinderen maar net zo goed voor autochtone kleuters
2049730 ten onrechte denken velen dat alleen maar kinderen van allochtone afkomst een taalachterstand hebben maar dat geldt net zo goed voor autochtone kinderen
2049731 one solution might be that we have to shut this facility down
2049732 we just ratified a contract like everybody is aware only a few months back and the inks hardly dry you can imagine our members are somewhat upset and i dont blame them but we will do everything we can to keep this business in syracuse
2049733 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
2049734 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
2049735 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
2049736 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
2049737 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems
2049738 we hope this is the first step in opening up the court docket and proceedings the current veil of secrecy does nothing but undermine confidence in the integrity of the probe since the beginning of the american democracy a free press has always been part of a transparent judicial system we hope our efforts will restore that openness and trust in judge montalvos court

2049740 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2049741 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg
2049742 ich habe bisher nur wenige spieler kennengelernt die so positiv und pr gnant ihre erfahrung eingebracht haben um gemeinsam alles f r den erfolg zu geben
2049743 die nummer eins f r dein land zu sein das ist doch das gr te was ein spieler erreichen kann es w re die best tigung meiner arbeit der letzten zwei jahre
2049744 es ist toll wie er als torwart mitspielt und ein spiel lesen kann er verk rpert den modernen torh ter von heute
2049745 die ganzen umst nde geben mir ein gutes gef hl ich glaube man steht mir beim dfb sehr positiv gegen ber
2049746 der bundestrainer hat mich bei em zur nummer zwei gemacht auch wenn das einige nicht zu interessieren scheint und sie lieber andere ins gepr ch bringen
2049747 fr her hat sich das meist wie von selbst ergeben k pke nach illgner kahn nach k pke lehmann nach kahn diesmal gibt es keine so eindeutige nummer 2 deshalb w rden wir falls die situation eintreten sollte erst einmal die leistungen beobachten es muss nicht sofort eine absolute festlegung auf die nummmer 1 stattfinden
2049748 todays settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated and we will actively seek justice on behalf of investors
2049749 our goal is simple to get investors back their money and thats exactly what this deal does
2049750 we are pleased to reach this agreement in principle with the new york attorney general the securities and exchange commission and other state regulatory agencies
2049751 we remain committed to continuing our work on initiatives that will secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity to our clients
2049752 just sending them a letter back that says its an act of god somehow just doesnt seem right so we are working here to try and see is there anything that can be done is there something a little bit more equitable for people
2049753 not going to say that the city has liability in this case
2049754 that is one of the things we are thinking about
2049755 its not clear to me that there is a tenable legal claim against the city what you have is flood damage its far from clear to me how the city is at fault for any of that its an act of god
2049756 basically what youve got is the comptroller unilaterally going out there and saying we are going to try to cut deals to pay a bunch of folks out of the city coffers for damage that the city is not liable for
2049757 well hell yes now that you mention it you could serve cocktails off that thing
2049758 hey we better get going or were going to be late
2049759 so dan i want you to be honest with me you know me is this true
2049760 you dont really want me to agree of disagree with each of these do you
2049761 pat since i think you are the real winner of the night i wanted to give you my surfboard
2049762 i hope that one day i can make someone feel as good about themselves as lauren conrad made me feel
2049763 shouldnt we all want to make someone else feel great if we can come on celebrities make someones day it will make you feel good too
2049764 i am so excited that the academy has asked me to design a dress for this years emmy awards
2049765 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the simple classic design of the lauren conrad collection but with a black tie twist
2049766 of all the real threats to ones standard of living inflation is perhaps the most overlooked
2049767 inflation is not something you just worry about at the peak of the business cycle its something investors have to worry about at all time
2049768 theres no way to guarantee when you get this volume of water mother nature is a horrific force to reckoned with
2049769 the ground has become super saturated over the past month with the constant rains what may seem like a normal shower or normal rain storm is just the straw that breaks the camels back and causes a situation like this
2049770 weve been hauling in stone all day as were re establishing some of the drainage structure were bringing in large stone to stabilize some of the banks and hopefully at least maintain the access weve achieved so far
2049771 once we get declaration well do a comprehensive assessment the damage is pretty significant were looking at a lot more than three million dollars
2049772 this potentially could be an ongoing situation the streams here are still very high were expecting more rain and were right in the path of the watershed it could be an ongoing issue if the weather doesnt subside
2049773 were estimating 20 000 to 30 000 in damage with regards to roads
2049774 the town hasnt got that in its budget but i dont know if municipal affairs will be able to help us out thats what theyre coming out for
2049775 all it takes is some little weak disturbance either at the surface or in the upper atmosphere to trigger these severe thunderstorms
2049776 we had a weak trough that went through here wednesday that caused the gambo thing and i would suggest something similar went through your area there
2049777 its opened to all northeastern communities affected by these heavy rainfalls
2049778 the show was done in order to provide a platform for youth who aspire to take up modelling as a career
2049779 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist
2049780 despite lower home prices relatively low interest rates and a large choice of available homes potential homebuyers remain reluctant due to eroding consumer confidence amid concerns about employment growth higher energy costs and the overall economy based on these demand dynamics coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009
2049781 well be able to root the team on and be here together
2049782 itll be nice to have him around to console me and for me to console him a little bit
