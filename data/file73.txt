731132 freddie sjostroms qualifying offer was extended past yesterdays 5 p m deadline to aug 4 were still negotiating sjostrom said in an email late yesterday
731133 sjostrom betts might be a speedy and hard working winger but a guy who scores a goal and an assist once every seven ty or eight ty games should not be on the roster at this point asking for more at this point not with the team right up against the salary cap already with sjostroms 880 000 betts 675k there is no room for lauri korpikoski to make the team with his 1 1 million nhl cap hit or artem anisimov at 850 000 johan franzen anze kopitar and alexander radulov were he to play in the nhl make what sjostrom is asking for make only slightly more than betts is scheduled for
731134 while it might seem like a no brainer to replace any or all of them with a player of shanahans eye popping accomplishments and continued ability to perform in the clutch both on the ice and in the dressing room not to mention in the boardroom when players and owners are at one anothers throats and on the phone when prospective free agents need to be told how wonderful playing for the rangers is sather has yet to make that move which at least suggests that rangers brass doesnt consider re signing shanahan a no brainer at all
731135 cant hit the net for all the tea in china
731136 orr guy that was banned but came back then left and came back
731137 dubi we didnt have anybody on the roster like voros or rissmiller these guys are tough guys pure sandpaper orr isnt that type of player nor was avery or hollweg and certainly not sjostrom fritsche is one of those types posted by rangerbill94
731138 jxmarts since when was toughness all about fighting and moreso fights won jameson july 17 2008 at 03 26 am

731147 orr guy that was banned but came back then left and is back
731148 theres a pattern and history of shoddy lazy journalism here
731149 shanahan is doubtful great player tremendous quote but i dont think it makes sense right now
731150 you have yourself a bet my eyes and organs for orrs left nut
731151 and im all for shanny coming back for the right price and role but why dump prucha who will probably be less expensive and just as productive to make room for him thats kind of silly shanahan provides you with leadership but lets be real so does drury gomez naslund redden and others
731152 hey lundqvist is good lets stock up on people from his homeland
731153 prucha can just be buried in the ahl and his salary is moot correct
731154 if were going to dump his salary we may as well dump it in a trade even if its for minimal value
731155 voros plays with such energy its as though somebody slipped a triple espresso into his water bottle
731156 it would be tough to find a player in team history that takes as much joy in leveling a player or scoring a goal and then telling the opponent all about it
731157 he scores a goal its like his first goal ever
731158 hes happy when a linemate scores its like his first goal ever hes great hes got a lot of life on the bench he goes on the ice and does what he has to do
731159 opposing players are forewarned securely fasten your chin straps and get a firm bite on your mouthpieces because you may not be in the upright position for long aaron voros is back on board
731160 the best thing the nanooks can probably do this weekend for aaron voros is to play like the sophomore forward aggressive gritty in your face hockey that can rattle the opposition get under the skin never stop and never back down

732601 yes but youre talking about something else some wandering spirit moving from body to body

732604 what i do is mix soy sauce and a dry white wine about half and half and then add a big dash or tarragon vinegar and some heaping spoonfuls of brown sugar and a tablespoon of olive oil about a teaspoon each of ginger and mustard powder and a dash of garlic powder mix that up and the longer you marinate things in it the better but just dipping in it will do too best on veggies chicken and flank steak sear the meat and then cook at a lower heat

732634 i thought i remember reading something about how the google guys had put themselves on regular selling schedules so as to avoid worries about insider knowledge if they then go off of those schedules and dont sell based on this knowledge isnt that the same impropriety that the schedules sought to avoid
732635 im pretty amazed if you look at the numbers googles revenue was only 90 million dollars thats million with an
732636 thats easy this 90 million must be just the beginning as we all know the market thinks 6 months ahead by the end of the year 550 will probably seem cheap and remember we need to realize all future profits now

732640 microsoft said this alternative transaction remains on the table and did not confirm that talks between it and yahoo have concluded
732641 instead the company is nearing an agreement with google involving its search advertising business the wall street journal reported
732642 perhaps yahoos talks with google began as posturing to avoid a deal with microsoft but now there are rumors that discussions between the two are really heating up

732685 we have more oil in north america than there is in the entire middle east
732686 americans are quite possibly the stupidest people on the face of the earth
732687 for some years now ive worried that we seem to be more and more like colonial england arrogant racist overestimating our own capacity and underestimating that of our enemies as the fate of the british empire demonstrates that is a fatal flaw
732688 remember ronaldus magnus talking about the shining city on a hill well there is no shining city on a hill without domestic oil coal gas and nuclear power there is no shining city on a hill with windmills and solar panels and compact fluorescents and hybrids and ethanol that has never equaled a shining city on a hill and it wont the democrats have turned the dimmers on in the shining city on a hill the democrats would prefer a blackout in the shining city on a hill

732693 our whole economy reflects the relative costs of energy the cars we drive the houses we occupy the kinds of factories we have and the equipment in them
732694 im expecting relatively large changes in all of these things
732695 you cant do that anymore your cost of transportation will spike too much
732696 eating out and discretionary income are a thing of the past for us
732697 domestic automakers built factories and tooled factories just to build trucks and suvs

732746 the states in closest proximity to columbia university new york state new jersey rhode island pennsylvania and connecticut have reported the most cases of lyme disease to the cdc lyme disease is not limited however to the northeast
732747 although lyme disease responds well when diagnosed and treated early patients unfortunately do not always see the tick bite or rash thats what just happened to me as
732748 these patients who dont see a bite are at risk of developing a chronic form of lyme disease which may affect the joints the heart and or the central or peripheral nervous system
732749 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us

732751 there is a great deal of national pride here at the very fact that china has been given a chance to host this world event and that feeling is overshadowing other concerns
732752 ive believed for a long time that youve got to engage china
732753 weve got issues around human rights rule of law and those kinds of issues ive got to find a way to ensure that we can continue to promote those issues with greatest effect although we have to engage we have to manage the relationship and thats certainly going to be a top priority for me
732754 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
732755 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
732756 i would really come back for the people the thai people seem to be incredibly generous warm kind of loving people so its very nice to be around them the crews are magnificent and everybody ive met in my brief time off has been lovely
732757 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

732760 we may not have put an end to all our problems
732761 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
732762 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
732763 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family

732765 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
732766 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
732767 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
732768 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
732769 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
732770 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be

732776 he certainly had the abilities and the training to pull off a d b cooper like stunt
732777 he had the temperament to do that and maybe had the motive
732778 he boasted of hijacking the plane and then leaping from its rear stairway to his sons and two attorneys
732779 gossett told greg to keep still and not tell anybody because it could result in his dad going to prison for the rest of his life
732780 final conservative statement from lambeth 2008 the push to validate same sex blessings has failed its time
732781 it s worth adding too that the call for a moratorium on interventions across provinces belongs in the same theological framework such interventions often imply that
732782 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
732783 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
732784 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals

732810 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
732811 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
732812 when you looked at his reaction when it happened there were natural moments that you cannot premeditate
732813 after the push armour took two or three steps because he still had his mind on the play then he turned around and went to the official to see if he was okay the natural reaction under stress is the truth so i have little doubt it was an incident of being blocked into the official
732814 afterward if the report is a little positive then thats real important
732815 if its real negative thats important if its somewhere in between then were probably making too much of it

732907 we had the wrong attitude for this friendly it was an important game
732908 the match was already difficult but after going 3 0 down in 15 minutes things got even more complicated
732909 it is a bad blow but now lets hope the holiday season is over
732910 there was nothing to take from the game but we must look forward
732911 the truth is that this moment for him is very difficult he is in a lot of pain
732912 we still have to do more tests but it doesnt look good
732913 i think its better to wait and hear what the doctor has to say that will be more complete and clearer but i can say that it is not good he will be out for a while
732914 it could be a cruciate ligament injury well have to wait and see what the professionals say
732915 were going to have to be without him for a bit
732916 we now have go back home and recover our spirits from all this
732917 but it is also something that happens in football all great footballers have had these things and im sure hell be back to normal soon
732918 its an english team and they play with a lot of intensity
732919 these things can happen its the way they play here and you have to accept that
732920 the emirates cup is a tournament with very prestigious teams and they all want to give a good display and win
732921 for that reason we had to be careful not to take risks and thats why the spain internationals didnt play its a pity because its a great tournament
732922 hes a great player and a great person we have to wait and see tomorrow hell have a scan and well have to hope for the best
732923 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer always is to give on the pitch
732924 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
732925 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration you have to show it with performances in this job
732926 do i like people kissing their badge why not if it is sincere and real then yes
732927 it was a good game with a good intensity for a pre season game
732928 we were not in trouble defensively and created many chances so it was very positive
732929 our shape was much better than yesterday and our movements were better so overall i am pleased we got what we wanted from the games
732930 i learned a lot about my team in the last two days
732931 it is better i dont speak about names i leave that to your imagination and creation
732932 if we sign a player we will come out and tell you but we are not close at the moment
732933 we cannot put any limitation on his participation in the team
732934 he is only 16 but he is not fazed by the big games
732935 the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
732936 theo is ahead of what he was doing at this period last season and he is still 19
732937 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
732938 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances
732939 his first touch is much better and he moves the ball quicker his penetration and final ball is better
732940 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
732941 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us
732942 maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
732943 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
732944 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
732945 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
732946 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
732947 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
732948 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else

733019 the real event of understanding goes continually beyond what can be brought to the understanding of the other persons words by methodological effort and critical self control it is true of every conversation that through it something different has come to be
733020 absorbed into the back and forth movement of the game that is into the definable procedure and rules of the game
733021 what is essential to the phenomenon of play is not so much the particular goal it involves but the dynamic back and forth movement in which the players are caught up the movement that itself specifies how the goal will be reached thus the game has its own place or space its spielraum and its movement and aims are cut off from the direct involvement in the world stretching beyond it

733026 to speak of a text as possessing an excess of meaning beyond the authors intention is to define what a text is in isolation from its orginary moments which amounts to an arbitrary redefinition of a preexisting given
733027 the performers first obligation then is to the score but to what score the autograph or the first printed edition the composers hasty manuscript or the presumably more careful copy by a trusted amanuensis the composers initial version or his later emendation the first german edition or the first french edition an original edition or one supposedly incorporating the composers instructions to his pupils those involved in the attempt to establish a canonic text of chopins works face all those decisions
733028 in fact it is exactly the space cleared by that approximation an area of indeterminacy that is the locus of the performers prime interpretative activity the realization of any score thus requires decisions at every point
733029 every age has to understand a transmitted text in its own way for the text belongs to the whole tradition whose content interests the age and in which it seeks to understand itself the real meaning of a text as it speaks to the interpreter does not depend on the contingencies of the author and his original audience it certainly is not identical with them for it is always co determined also by the historical situation of the interpreter and hence by the totality of the objective course of history not just occasionally but always the meaning of a text goes beyond its author that is why understanding is not merely a reproductive but always a productive activity as well
733030 excess of meaning beyond the authors intention which amounts to an arbitrary redefinition of a preexisting given
733031 i know you asked about the earliest debates over homer
733032 i woudl say that texts have the same ground in the intentino of their author as my spoken statements have in me when i speak them
733033 the burden of proof is on anyone who supposes that language is anything more than a medium for communication

733044 why can we not do both vote for obama and be missional communities for justice in our neighborhoods
733045 are we supporting obama because its easier than being gods justice in the world ourselves
733046 the new energy for justice on the local level by emerging and missional church movements might be dissipated by the obama hope
733047 you seriously think the church can do a better job through ad hoc charity work than a modern welfare state can do thats ridiculous to me
733048 would you prefer for the church to administer social security for example should the church provide universal health coverage for retirees
733049 help others puruse their egosim as you would want others to help you pursue yours
733050 notice please that as the nature of american politics has become increasingly socialist
733051 i want to note that these are observations and questions more than statements and what i have observed thus far is an agressive attack on libertarian principles because they fall under the title libertarian the original concern in this post was that in the wake of an increasingly socialistic society the church could be pushed aside still no one coming from a non libertarian perspective has addressed this concern if they have my apologies for missing it
733052 furthermore is it really true that the u s is not becoming more socialist maybe it hasnt reached a certain extreme that other countries have but that doesnt invalidate the point

733066 the coin was acquired in 1942 by baltimore banker louis e eliasberg sr whose legendary collection earned him the nickname the king of coins although most of his collection was sold over the years after his death in 1976 this unique coin was not known to exist until it came out of the vault for an auction in 2005 and its early americana importance was recognized
733067 its the only known coin counter marked by silversmith barry i think there may be others but perhaps the coins owners dont recognize barrys hallmarks
733068 the doubloon which is believed to have been made by barry in baltimore at sometime around 1790 is currently the only coin we know that was counter marked by him there are a small number of 1790 dated standish barry three pence pieces known but those are not counter marked
733069 we will pay 5 000 just to be the first to see the first new authentic standish barry countermarked gold coin and 1 000 per additional piece for that may turn up we also will pay 1 000 for the first genuine silver countermarked piece and 500 for additional one

733091 sen liebermans approval rating has dropped below 50 percent for the first time in 14 years of polling with nearly two thirds of democrats giving him low marks probably because he is campaigning for sen john mccain
733092 the business community is already doing an awful lot in areas like western australia and the northern territory and queensland
733093 i think this comes at a very important time and a very good time
733094 we are short of people we are short of skills so there is not a better time to take this initiative
733095 i think the fact that labors decided not to stand a candidate means its a more open contest than it might have otherwise been
733096 it gives an opportunity for an independent or a minor party to come through
733097 i think at the end of the day though the liberals probably should be confident theyll still hold mayo
733098 with the by election we know that the governments not going to change hands so at the end of this mayo election kevin rudd will still be prime minister so it means the voters of mayo can perhaps bring some other considerations to bear
733099 we will be talking to the minister about the appropriate amount of volume that will be able to be extracted there

733105 we would hope to see a resolution to the dispute sooner rather than later but if we need to take this matter right up to the next state election then thats what will happen
733106 i dont believe that there will be industrial action right up until the next election and we will resolve these issues and the best way of doing that is ensuring that we continue to negotiate and we continue to talk and we do so in good faith
733107 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
733108 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward
733109 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have a high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth

733113 rates of pelvic pain in australia are high yet our findings suggest only about a third of women who experience it seek advice from their health professional
733114 women who fail to respond to these treatments should be referred to a gynaecologist earlier rather than later especially if they wish to conceive in the future

733117 the future of our country depends upon our young people being involved politically as well informed voters our youth must be prepared to evaluate candidates by the content of their policies not merely the label of their party this is the only way we can be assured that all of our future elected leaders will embody the values that have made this nation great lower taxes limited government strong national defense faith in god and equal opportunities for all

733127 the previous agreements were between the military and the militants they were limited in scope and they were wrong
733128 they were strategically wrong that is why they did not work out these agreements that we are conducting now are between the government of pakistan and the tribal people and this is based on the traditional relationship we have with them

733135 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
733136 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
733137 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
733138 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
733139 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
733140 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
733141 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
733142 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
733143 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
733144 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
733145 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
733146 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
733147 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
733148 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
733149 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
733150 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
733151 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
733152 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
733153 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
733154 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
733155 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
733156 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
733157 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
733158 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
733159 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
733160 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
733161 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
733162 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
733163 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
733164 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
733165 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
733166 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
733167 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
733168 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
733169 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
733170 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
733171 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
733172 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
733173 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
733174 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
733175 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
733176 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
733177 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
733178 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
733179 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

733198 the amount of clean up left to do likely depends on house prices

733200 investors are going to be very wary of any indication of further deterioration in the labor market

733202 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
733203 dios te est llamando est is a un click de estar con l
733204 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
733205 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
733206 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
733207 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
733208 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
733209 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
733210 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
733211 who are open to doing something on the production side
733212 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
733213 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
733214 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
733215 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

733221 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
733222 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
733223 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
733224 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
733225 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
733226 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
733227 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
733228 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
733229 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
733230 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
733231 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
733232 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
733233 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
733234 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
733235 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
733236 we had a meeting and they were like three to five minutes late
733237 coach brown said they couldnt play we were kind of shocked a i cant play amare cant play lebron cant play we thought it was hurting our team so to start off like that you could say it carried over
733238 he came to me one day and said it means a lot to me if you could answer this question do you believe that ive told the truth i told him i believe you donaghy told us the truth
733239 the racial angle is the first thing i thought of when i saw that ad

733254 you could think of ron wayne kind of like the fifth beatle
733255 he had a strong association with steve jobs and steve wozniak in the beginning but was not a participant in their future success
733256 we are very happy to be able to share his story he represents a bit of history that very few people witnessed and most never knew
733257 the addition of ron wayne to the film was simple
733258 the film lives in high definition as a finalcut pro project his interview was a natural addition
733259 we are still on course for a fall delivery of the dvd which will be so much more than just the movie the hardest thing has been deciding what not to include
733260 there are so many great stories from the people that are part of apples history we are really excited to share this with everyone
733261 we have a more special presentations in the works for the fall that will allow more people to get the opportunity see it on the big screen
733262 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art

733264 a school is a factory is a poem is a prison is academia is boredom with flashes of panic
733265 this isnt how i usually spend my on line time
733266 a school is a factory is a poem is a prison is academia is boredom with flashes of panic
733267 oops i fat fingered the spelling of that word heres the correct version so you know what i meant
733268 i really like living here and the staff are great they even change my light bulbs for me when they burn out as i cannot get up on a step ladder anymore i really appreciate them all
733269 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
733270 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
733271 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
733272 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
733273 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
733274 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
733275 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
733276 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
733277 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
733278 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
733279 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
733280 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
733281 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
733282 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
733283 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
733284 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
733285 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
733286 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

733288 there are more than 360 studies done to determine if stretching prevents injuries stretching before practice or games will not prevent injury our players need to be warmed up before a game or practice the literature states that for an exercise to be considered a warm up the core tissue temperature must be increased two degrees or break a sweat at room temperature stretching does neither the next best warm up is active stretching where the athlete moves and takes his muscles through an active range of motion those are the types of activities our players perform in the three lines before practice the best warm up is performing the position specific skill patterns our players perform on the field gradually performing them at faster speeds until they are eventually practicing at game speed we only have a seven minute period to warm them up the activities we use are best for the allotted time the time to stretch is after exercise not before

733315 we are here to give a message to the government and our message is very clear
733316 we have just 100 months in which to effect a massive transition away from a fossil fuel economy
733317 the governments addiction to fossil fuels is not only destroying the environment but also peoples lives now
733318 illegal action is what has always changed the world from the campaign against slavery to womens votes to the civil rights movement in america
733319 now the government is failing so badly we believe direct action is needed to stop this massive expansion of carbon intensive industries
733320 we have made it clear to the protesters that we expect them to abide by the law
733321 we were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting

733328 i heard ambassador peck on an interview yesterday did anybody else see or hear him he was on fox news this is a white man and he was upsetting the fox news commentators to no end he pointed out a white man an ambassador he pointed out that what malcolm x said when he was silenced by elijah mohammad was in fact true he said americas chickens are coming home to roost
733329 we took this country by terror away from the sioux the apache arikara the comanche the arapaho the navajo terrorism
733330 we took africans away from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear terrorism
733331 we bombed grenada and killed innocent civilians babies non military personnel
733332 we bombed the black civilian community of panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenage and toddlers pregnant mothers and hard working fathers
733333 we bombed qaddafis home and killed his child blessed are they who bash your childrens head against the rock
733334 we bombed iraq we killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living we bombed a plant in sudan to pay back for the attack on our embassy killed hundreds of hard working people mothers and fathers who left home to go that day not knowing that theyd never get back home
733335 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye
733336 kids playing in the playground mothers picking up children after school civilians not soldiers people just trying to make it day by day
733337 we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff that we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards americas chickens are coming home to roost
733338 violence begets violence hatred begets hatred and terrorism begets terrorism a white ambassador said that yall not a black militant not a reverend who preaches about racism an ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised the ambassador said the people we have wounded dont have the military capability we have but they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them and we need to come to grips with that
733339 we have got to change the way we have been doing things as a society
733340 maybe we need to declare war on aids in five minutes the congress found 40 billion to rebuild new york and the families that died in sudden death do you think we can find the money to make medicine available for people who are dying a slow death maybe we need to declare war on the nations healthcare system that leaves the nations poor with no health coverage maybe we need to declare war on the mishandled educational system and provide quality education for everybody every citizen based on their ability to learn not their ability to pay this is a time for social transformation

733351 i was a soldier in the iraqi army in the war of 1991 and during the withdrawal from kuwait i decided to seek asylum in saudi arabia along with dozens of others like me that was how began the process whereby i was recruited into the american forces for there were us military committees that chose a number of iraqis who were willing to volunteer to join them and be transported to america i was one of those
733352 carry out specific tasks assigned him by the us agencies
733353 in charge of a group of a unit that carried out assassinations in the streets of baghdad
733354 our task was to carry out assassinations of individuals the us occupation army would supply us with their names pictures and maps of their daily movements to and from their place of residence and we were supposed to kill the shii for example in the and kill the sunni in the of madinat as sadr and so on
733355 anyone in the unit who made a mistake was killed three members of my team were killed by us occupation forces after they failed to assassinate sunni political figures in baghdad
733356 doesnt only carry out assassinations but some of them specialize in planting bombs and car bombs in neighborhoods and markets
733357 operations of planting car bombs and blowing up explosives in markets are carried out in various ways the best known and most famous among the us troops is placing a bomb inside cars as they are being searched at checkpoints

733361 i am being fired because i am trying to ensure that my curriculum is relevant to my students daily lived experiences and in the process create a space for them to be critical of eurocentric society and curricula that only serve to reinforce their dehumanization subjugation and oppression
733362 struggles for freedom both attract and create remarkable individuals as well as associations
733363 my own experiences are in part what made me write this book the life of an arab palestinian in the west particularly in america is disheartening there exists here an almost unanimous consensus that politically he does not exist and when it is allowed that he does it is either as a nuisance or as an oriental
733364 a palestinian lawmaker recently released from israeli captivity has accused israel of
733365 if my case had been handled by any other court in this wide world i wouldnt have stayed in jail for a single day but israel and justice are a scandalous oxymoron and i think the israelis themselves are aware of this disgrace
733366 i dont know how to describe the israeli court system imagine they wanted to indict me for statements made on al jazeera tv by hamas gaza leader mahmoud al zahhar as if i were responsible for every word uttered by people and leaders israel doesnt like
733367 their message was very clear that we are above you and above your national will and that israel and israel alone has the final say and that it is israel not the palestinian people who decides who represents the palestinians
733368 i was charged with membership in an anti israeli organization and with acting against the interests of israel and posing a threat to the safety and security of the region where we live
733369 when i told the judge that i participated in an election which the israeli government had approved and that if participation in the election was indeed against the law israel should have made it clear beforehand that anyone participating in the elections would be arrested
733370 however the attorney general of the israeli army argued that the israeli government had the right to change its mind retrospectively then they told us that we were being arrested as a reprisal for the capture of gilad shalit
733371 they treat us very much like the nazis treated jews during wwii
733372 the way they treat palestinian prisoners is designed to humiliate to insult to torment to inflict as much emotional and psychological pain as possible
733373 there is no justice or decency or civility in the israeli justice system as far as non jews in general and palestinians in particular are concerned
733374 yes they do treat their own people jews according to the law but the rule of law ends when palestinian rights begin
733375 imagine languishing in such a filthy chamber in high temperature and with very little oxygen for up to 24 hours it is a real ordeal
733376 the u s supported occupation violence against palestine continues unchecked
733377 the shevak is unfit to me how come you go there
733378 i want you to put all the money on the table english pounds and then he asked me to go outside with him while he checked my bags every piece of paper
733379 mohammed you know that greece is not a friend of israel
733380 if i knew that you would be coming back to gaza i wouldnt have let you out in the first place
733381 as omers colleague i cannot reconcile the disparity in our experiences how can we reconcile something that is irreconcilable in the absence of all justice
733382 i thought they would feel right at home in the alleys of balata refugee camp the casbah and the hawara checkpoint
733383 to deprive people of humane medical care you know people die because of that
733384 the checkpoints are supposedly for security purposes but anyone who wants to perpetrate an attack can pay nis 10 for a taxi and travel by bypass roads or walk through the hills the real purpose is to make life hard for the inhabitants the civilian population suffers
733385 on the top of every hill on gerizim and ebal is an israeli army outpost that is watching us
733386 dont throw paper into the toilet bowl because we have a water shortage
733387 we came here lacking in knowledge and are thirsty to know we are shocked by what we have seen until now it is very clear to us that the situation here is intolerable
733388 the israeli soldiers are cowards that is why they created routes of movement with bulldozers in doing so they killed three generations of one family the shubi family with the bulldozers
733389 it is hard for me to describe what i am feeling what i see here is worse than what we experienced but i am encouraged to find that there are courageous people here we want to support you in your struggle by every possible means there are quite a few jews in our delegation and we are very proud that they are the ones who brought us here they are demonstrating their commitment to support you in our country we were able to unite all the forces behind one struggle and there were courageous whites including jews who joined the struggle i hope we will see more israeli jews joining your struggle
733390 the absolute control of peoples lives the lack of freedom of movement the army presence everywhere the total separation and the extensive destruction we saw
733391 talk about the promised land and the chosen people adds a religious dimension to racism which we did not have
733392 when you observe from afar you know that things are bad but you do not know how bad
733393 the apartheid regime viewed the blacks as inferior i do not think the israelis see the palestinians as human beings at all
733394 under apartheid whites and blacks met in certain places the israelis and the palestinians do not meet any longer at all the separation is total it seems to me that the israelis would like the palestinians to disappear there was never anything like that in our case the whites did not want the blacks to disappear i saw the settlers in silwan in east jerusalem people who want to expel other people from their place
733395 the african national congress issued its academic boycott call in the 1950s the international community started to heed it almost three decades later so you guys are doing much better than us

733414 a secret deal being negotiated in baghdad would perpetuate the american military occupation of iraq indefinitely regardless of the outcome of the us presidential election in november
733415 the essence of this agreement is to turn the iraqis into slaves of the americans
733416 after months of a tough and bitter race a merciless struggle barack obama has defeated his formidable opponent hillary clinton he has wrought a miracle for the first time in history a black person has become a credible candidate for the presidency of the most powerful country in the world

733423 defining the status of the palestinian citizens of israel has always been a puzzle for many scholars

733433 the south african war was the greatest test of british imperial power since the indian mutiny and turned into the most extensive and costly war fought by britain between the defeat of napoleon and the first world war
733434 we have free and open discussion here in israel what are you talking about
733435 jerusalem the us political author and critic of israel norman finkelstein was denied entry to the jewish state on friday his lawyer said finkelstein landed at ben gurion international airport near tel aviv in the early morning and was told by a representative of the ministry of interior that he would not be allowed into the country on security grounds attorney michael sfard told dpa finkelstein who is jewish and the son of holocaust survivors has written critical books on israeli policies in the palestinian territories and on what he called exploitation of the jewish tragedy during world war ii finkelstein has received with the fierce disapproval of some authors and academics while others have praised his controversial works
733436 the current approach to development which is entirely removed from the needs of palestinian communities aims to normalize relations with the occupation treating it as development partner in projects across the west bank
733437 we propose to refocus reform and renew our approach to the nations highway and transit systems by completely overhauling the way u s transportation decisions and investments are made
733438 in a contest between the forces of reform and the forces of the status quo the forces of reform will prevail because the next administration the congressional leadership and state level policymakers of both parties will realize that the present federal approach to transportation is not working
733439 in keeping with our federalist system we should deploy federal transportation resources in areas fundamentally in the federal interest and empower states and localities to use their own resources to best meet state and local needs
733440 by driving less and using more fuel efficient vehicles americans are showing us that the highways of tomorrow cannot be supported solely by the federal gas tax
733441 a collection of the same uninspired and uninspiring policies that this administration has offered over the past five years
733442 a dead hand reaching out from the past to affect the future
733443 in recent days all the major international banks imf world bank inter american development bank asia development bank etc all the major financial newspapers and mass media have been forced to recognize that there is a major food crisis that hundreds of millions of people face hunger malnutrition and outright starvation
733444 the worlds poor countries will spend about 38 7 billion dollars importing cereals this year double the amount they paid two years ago for the same amounts and a 57 increase from 2007
733445 world conferences have been convoked national emergencies have been declared as millions riot in nearly 50 countries and threaten to overthrow regimes and mass social tensions rise even in the most dynamic high growth countries like china and india even in the imperialist countries in north america and europe skyrocketing food prices combined with stagnant wages home evictions and debt payments threaten incumbent regimes and increase pressures on all governments to take urgent action the elite responses are predictably inadequate and their explanations for the crisis range from inadequate self serving to silly the world bank repeats the call for emergency food aid and several hundred million dollar grants to the most needy those countries where there have been major food riots sacking private food distributors private wholesale and retail outlets and threatening or ousting free market regimes who have been the model pupils of the world bank and imf policies the self styled economic experts predictably make asses of themselves trying to evade the failure of their past prescriptions conservatives and liberal and progressive academics and policy advisers all blame china for eating too much meat professor paul krugman of princeton university and new york times columnist the growth of demand inflation the progressives point to the diversion of production to bio fuels ethanol and bio diesel or to the lack of government planning and the distortion of priorities the increased food aid has yet to have anything but momentary impact in limited regions on a fraction of the affected population pointing the finger at the growth of demand begs the question of the lack of supply and the structural features land tenure profit seeking ownership patterns and state class relations which shape it equally important even where foodstuffs arrive at the market they are priced out of reach for the majority of urban and rural workers peasants and the unemployed the supply demand critics fail to apply a class analysis of the producers who determine the price system according to their oligopolistic market power and criteria for profits and the consumers informal and poorly paid formal workers with declining income capitalist farmers are in a position to protect and even increase their profits by passing added costs for inputs on to the weaker market power of the consumers aided and abetted by the neo liberal free market political regimes the progressives who blame bio fuels for the food crisis higher prices resulting from the diversion of grains and land use to fuel production fail to address the most elementary structural questions what classes came to state power and fashioned the economic policies which enabled the diversion to take place heavy private and state borrowing in the 1970s due to the availability of cheap credit led to the growth of indebtedness indebted private banks businesses and manufacturers real estate developers through powerful influence and direct links to the state foisted their private debts onto the state and ultimately onto the taxpayers what was later described as socializing the private debt or bailing out the private sector the state faced with mounting debt obligations the so called debt crisis turned to the imf and world bank to secure loans and more important to gain their certification for jumbo loans from commercial banks the imf and world bank demanded fundamental structural changes from the state to grant loans these conditional loans involved a comprehensive transformation in investment trade consumption and income policies which had a major impact on the class structure and the composition of the ruling class the international loans both official and commercial and the structural changes which accompanied them led to the elimination of protective trade barriers in agriculture and manufacturing as a result there was a massive inflow of subsidized agricultural commodities from the us and the european union which destroyed small and medium size family farm producers of basic foodstuffs the bankruptcy of food producers led to massive displacements of farmers and farm workers to the cities and the concentration of land in the hands of agro business plantations owners who concentrated on growing crops for export the imf and world bank demands included the re allocation of state credit loans and technical assistance toward big agro exporters in single commodities because they earned hard currency needed to pay back loans and for profit remittances of the multinational corporations back to their stock holders directors and owners the imf and world bank agreed to negotiate the roll over of impending interest and principal payments of debtor states on condition that they privatize and de nationalize all lucrative and monopoly state enterprises privatizations and de nationalization led to large scale foreign takeovers of vast tracts of rich agricultural lands and grain production and exports by local landed oligarchs and foreign investors these policies eliminating trade barriers and promoting privatization and de nationalizations the deep penetration of markets and production sectors and the heightened emphasis of state intervention on behalf of export oriented foreign exchange earnings economic activity was dubbed neo liberalism this model was a combination of state directed and regulated socio economic policies to designed to enhance the role and power of foreign and domestic elites oriented toward specialized world markets the ascendancy of this new power configuration during the 1980s and 1990s dictated the key political and economic decisions regarding investments their allocations their sector and sub sector as well as the markets internal and external and the products foods fuels staples and pricing oligopolistic cartels the basic principle guiding the new foreign and domestic ruling classes was to specialize in complementary activity within the world economy what orthodox economists call specialization based on comparative advantages the integration of foreign and local ruling classes was mutually supportive and lucrative private capital and commodities traversed their international commodity and financial circuits the large scale middle term consequences of this new power configuration for agriculture food production and prices manifested itself in a little over a decade by the second half of the first decade of the 21st century an unprecedented agricultural crisis erupted the ascendancy of the agro export sector of the ruling class and the implementation of their free market agenda led to the end of price controls and the skyrocketing of prices prices reflected the social relations of production and distribution big capitalist farmer dominance of land and investment shaped supply and wholesales prices giant global commercial retailers supermarkets set direct consumer prices there was competition between oligopolist producers and distributors over who could secure the highest prices and biggest profits the ruling class agro exporters ended subsidies for family farmer food producers and increased export subsidies for staple producers family farmers were bankrupted and their land was bought up by real estate speculators self styled developers for commercial uses golf courses resorts luxury gated communities and export staples rice fields were turned into country clubs wheat and corn prices doubled in the course of the ten months between september 2007 and july 2008 profits fatten ed cargills balance sheet financial times april 15 2008 p 21 quarterly profits went up 86 to 1 03 billion dollars in the third quarter ending february 29 2008 it was not simply as the orthodox pundits would have it that demand was up but that hundreds of billions of speculator monies poured into commodity markets under conditions of tightly controlled markets by big agribusiness grain stocks fell to their lowest levels in 35 years relative to demand largely because big agro capital sought to limit supply of food and increase production of fuel and diverted capital to commodity speculation as a result of the ascendancy of giant agro capitalist rule and their investment and land use policies average food prices rose by 45 between july 2007 and april 2008 and is projected to rise by an additional 15 by july frightened more by mass protests toppling compliant client regimes than mass hunger and rising mortality of the poor the capitalist leaders from around the world met in washington in the spring of 2008 they whined about the food riots and moaned over the loss of a decades progress sic in africa and even called for action as could be expected a few hundred million in emergency food aid was promised destroying the last bastions of small scale farmers producing food for the local market neo liberal regimes throughout asia were frightened into blocking exports of basic food items in order to prevent food riots turning into mass insurrections wages and salaries lagged behind accelerating food prices the neo liberal regimes of indonesia egypt india vietnam china and cambodia banned foreign sales of rice financial times april 16 2008 p 1 yet these protectionist gestures and food handouts have had little positive effect at home and have exacerbated scarcities for food importers corn futures hit a record 6 16 dollars a bushel between january to march 2008 a 30 increase indonesias export ban raised the price of rice 63 during the first 3 months of 2008 none of the world leaders meeting in washington concerned about hunger regression and most of all revolutions proposed agrarian reform redistributing land to peasants and farmers to produce food none of the leaders even proposed reforms such as price and profit controls and the re conversion of land use to agricultural production none of these leaders proposed outlawing speculation in commodity futures in the world bourses it is no wonder that the imf predicts food prices will continue rising until 2010 the fuel prices have not been reduced with the triple digit increase in ethanol production ethanol and fuel and food prices have increased despite expansion of production because the same monopoly power configuration operates in both sectors the wage price gap is structural immiseration the mass protests in the third as well as the imperial countries are over immediate basic problems but their roots are embedded in the deep structures of the capitalist economy only mindless prestigious orthodox economists employed by the central banks still prattle about core and headline inflation as if food fuel health and education price increases are not central to everyday life for billions of lives even worse they fail to understand that rampant inflation and stagnant incomes are deeply embedded in the very structures of capitalist economy and state what is absolutely clear is the bankruptcy of the theory of export product specialization at the expanse of food security what was a demand of a radical minority is now at the top of the agenda for multi billion person movement people are demanding a u turn from the disastrous friedmanite theories of relying on monopolized world food markets to a return to revolutionary policies of food self sufficiency

733449 you were blamed argus not for doing your job but for spreading a false rumour that alarmed 350 local families unnecessarily even the tory mp who contacted you said that he expected you to check before rushing into print you ran the scare for two days before checking with the local mps who knew the truth you reported a secret plan to close newport passport office balderdash there was no plan one phone call to either jessica morden or myself would have scotched that falsehood immediately our city has been a very successful magnet for attracting and retaining civil service jobs crying wolf on job losses is demoralizing and feeds the antagonism against relocating jobs in newport that is prevalent in london the office for national statistics jobs came here in spite of a concerted anti newport campaign spreading gloomy false rumours does not help lets hope the lesson is learned
733450 i suggested to the argus who had also heard about this that they speak to the home office to get a comment before going to print i am not sure if this happened

733481 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
733482 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
733483 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
733484 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
733485 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
733486 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt

733510 you have done a valuable piece of work and rendered a great service to the party comrade taganov you could not have chosen a better time for it you have put into our hands just the case we needed with the present difficult economic situation 1 and the dangerous trend of public sentiment 2 the government has to show the masses who is responsible for their suffering and show it in a manner that will not be forgotten 3 the treacherous counter revolutionary activities of speculators who deprive our toilers of their hard earned food rations 4 must be brought into the full light of proletarian 5 justice the workers must be reminded that their class enemies 6 are plotting day and night to undermine the only workers government in the world 7 our toiling masses must be told that they have to bear their temporary hardships patiently and lend their full support to the government 8 which is fighting for their interests against such heavy odds as the case youve discovered will display to the public this in substance was the subject of my conversation with the editor of the pravda 9 this morning in regard to the campaign we are starting we shall make an example of this case every newspaper every club every public pulpit will be mobilized for the task
733511 although the army biological weapons lab where ivins worked ft detrick in frederick md had long been on the fbis radar scientists were unable to pinpoint the specific strain used in the attacks until recently
733512 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
733513 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
733514 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
733515 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true

733517 i had bought opening and closing ceremony tickets swim finals and some football tickets i must say that up until now i was hoping that the tickets would just turn up but i have been complaining to various authorities about this because i sensed it was a scam a few months ago
733518 ill pursue this when i get back i am going to track these guys i have been in touch with some others who have lost money and we estimate these guys have been raking in much more than 50 million
733519 we were good today today is a big result for us
733520 they threw a lot at us and we scored a lot of points
733521 i think there is a long way to go in our attack but what we do know is the chemistry is there
733522 we scored 34 points but it was on the back of our defence
733523 our defence doesnt change and at the end of the day thats what got us the points

733529 you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut
733530 trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price
733531 you are the second man to day that has used that expression to me
733532 a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse
733533 if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him i should prefer having a partner to being alone
733534 perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion
733535 oh i didnt say there was anything against him he is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough
733536 no i have no idea what he intends to go in for i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a first class chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of out of the way knowledge which would astonish his professors
733537 did you never ask him what he was going in for
733538 no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him
733539 if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence how could i meet this friend of yours
733540 he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon
733541 you mustnt blame me if you dont get on with him
733542 i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible
733543 if we dont get on it will be easy to part company
733544 that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter is this fellows temper so formidable or what is it dont be mealy mouthed about it
733545 holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to cold bloodedness i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge
733546 yes but it may be pushed to excess when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting rooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape
733547 yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death i saw him at it with my own eyes
733548 and yet you say he is not a medical student
733549 no heaven knows what the objects of his studies are but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him
733550 i have found a re agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin 4 and by nothing else
733551 the question now is about hoemoglobin no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine
733552 why man it is the most practical medico legal discovery for years dont you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains come over here now
733553 now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water you perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction
733554 beautiful beautiful the old guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain so is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles the latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old now this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes
733555 criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they that is a question which has puzzled many an expert and why because there was no reliable test now we have the sherlock holmes test and there will no longer be any difficulty
733556 there was the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence then there was mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans i could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive
733557 my friend here wants to take diggings and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you i thought that i had better bring you together
733558 i have my eye on a suite in baker street
733559 which would suit us down to the ground you dont mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope
733560 thats good enough i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiments would that annoy you
733561 let me see what are my other shortcomings i get in the dumps at times and dont open my mouth for days on end you must not think i am sulky when i do that just let me alone and ill soon be right what have you to confess now its just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together
733562 and i object to rows because my nerves are shaken and i get up at all sorts of ungodly hours and i am extremely lazy i have another set of vices when im well but those are the principal ones at present
733563 do you include violin playing in your category of rows
733564 i think we may consider the thing as settled that is if the rooms are agreeable to you
733565 call for me here at noon to morrow and well go together and settle everything
733566 how the deuce did he know that i had come from afghanistan
733567 a good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out
733568 this is very piquant i am much obliged to you for bringing us together the proper study of mankind is man you know
733569 youll find him a knotty problem though ill wager he learns more about you than you about him good bye
733570 now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it
733571 i consider that a mans brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work but of these he has a large assortment and all in the most perfect order it is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before it is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones
733572 you say that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work
733573 if i can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments and discovering a calling which needs them all
733574 i may as well give up the attempt at once
733575 i have to use this room as a place of business
733576 a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other so all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems let him on meeting a fellow mortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for by a mans finger nails by his coat sleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a mans calling is plainly revealed that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable
733577 i see that you have read it since you have marked it i dont deny that it is smartly written it irritates me though it is evidently the theory of some arm chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study it is not practical i should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellow travellers i would lay a thousand to one against him
733578 yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction the theories which i have expressed there and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical so practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese
733579 well i have a trade of my own i suppose i am the only one in the world im a consulting detective if you can understand what that is here in london we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones when these fellows are at fault they come to me and i manage to put them on the right scent they lay all the evidence before me and i am generally able by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime to set them straight there is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends it is odd if you cant unravel the thousand and first lestrade is a well known detective he got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case and that was what brought him here
733580 they are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies they are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening i listen to their story they listen to my comments and then i pocket my fee
733581 that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have seen every detail for themselves
733582 quite so i have a kind of intuition that way now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex then i have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes you see i have a lot of special knowledge which i apply to the problem and which facilitates matters wonderfully those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work observation with me is second nature you appeared to be surprised when i told you on our first meeting that you had come from afghanistan
733583 nothing of the sort i knew you came from afghanistan from long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that i arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps there were such steps however the train of reasoning ran here is a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man clearly an army doctor then he has just come from the tropics for his face is dark and that is not the natural tint of his skin for his wrists are fair he has undergone hardship and sickness as his haggard face says clearly his left arm has been injured he holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner where in the tropics could an english army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded clearly in afghanistan the whole train of thought did not occupy a second i then remarked that you came from afghanistan and you were astonished
733584 you remind me of edgar allen poes dupin i had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories
733585 no doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to dupin
733586 now in my opinion dupin was a very inferior fellow that trick of his of breaking in on his friends thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hours silence is really very showy and superficial he had some analytical genius no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as poe appeared to imagine
733587 does lecoq come up to your idea of a detective
733588 he had only one thing to recommend him and that was his energy that book made me positively ill the question was how to identify an unknown prisoner i could have done it in twenty four hours lecoq took six months or so it might be made a text book for detectives to teach them what to avoid
733589 there are no crimes and no criminals in these days
733590 what is the use of having brains in our profession i know well that i have it in me to make my name famous no man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which i have done and what is the result there is no crime to detect or at most some bungling villany with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it
733591 a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir no answer right sir
733592 excuse my rudeness you broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well so you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of marines
733593 it was easier to know it than to explain why i knew it if you were asked to prove that two and two made four you might find some difficulty and yet you are quite sure of the fact even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellows hand that smacked of the sea he had a military carriage however and regulation side whiskers there we have the marine he was a man with some amount of self importance and a certain air of command you must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane a steady respectable middle aged man too on the face of him all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant
733594 i said just now that there were no criminals it appears that i am wrong look at this
733595 it does seem to be a little out of the common
733596 he and lestrade are the pick of a bad lot they are both quick and energetic but conventional shockingly so they have their knives into one another too they are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties there will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent
733597 im not sure about whether i shall go i am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather that is when the fit is on me for i can be spry enough at times
733598 why it is just such a chance as you have been longing for
733599 my dear fellow what does it matter to me supposing i unravel the whole matter you may be sure that gregson lestrade and co will pocket all the credit that comes of being an unofficial personage
733600 yes he knows that i am his superior and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person however we may as well go and have a look i shall work it out on my own hook i may have a laugh at them if i have nothing else come on
733601 you dont seem to give much thought to the matter in hand
733602 it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence it biases the judgment
733603 this is the brixton road and that is the house if i am not very much mistaken
733604 if a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess no doubt however you had drawn your own conclusions gregson before you permitted this
733605 i have had so much to do inside the house
733606 my colleague mr lestrade is here i had relied upon him to look after this
733607 with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the ground there will not be much for a third party to find out
733608 i think we have done all that can be done
733609 its a queer case though and i knew your taste for such things
733610 it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken
733611 then of course this blood belongs to a second individual 8 presumably the murderer if murder has been committed it reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen in utrecht in the year 34 do you remember the case gregson
733612 read it up you really should there is nothing new under the sun it has all been done before
733613 no more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination
733614 theres nothing to be learned by staring at it what did you find in his pockets
733615 a gold watch no 97163 by barraud of london gold albert chain very heavy and solid gold ring with masonic device gold pin head with rubies as eyes russian leather card case with cards of enoch j drebber of cleveland corresponding with the e j d upon the linen no purse but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen pocket edition of boccaccios decameron with name of joseph stangerson upon the fly leaf two letters one addressed to e j drebber and one to joseph stangerson
733616 american exchange strand to be left till called for they are both from the guion steamship company and refer to the sailing of their boats from liverpool it is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to new york
733617 have you made any inquiries as to this man stangerson
733618 i have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers and one of my men has gone to the american exchange but he has not returned yet
733619 we simply detailed the circumstances and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us
733620 you did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial
733621 nothing else is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge will you not telegraph again
733622 i have just made a discovery of the highest importance and one which would have been overlooked had i not made a careful examination of the walls
733623 this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room and no one thought of looking there the murderer has written it with his or her own blood see this smear where it has trickled down the wall that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow why was that corner chosen to write it on i will tell you see that candle on the mantelpiece it was lit at the time and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall
733624 and what does it mean now that you have found it
733625 mean why it means that the writer was going to put the female name rachel but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish you mark my words when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named rachel has something to do with it its all very well for you to laugh mr sherlock holmes you may be very smart and clever but the old hound is the best when all is said and done
733626 you certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and as you say it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last nights mystery i have not had time to examine this room yet but with your permission i shall do so now
733627 they say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains
733628 its a very bad definition but it does apply to detective work
733629 it would be robbing you of the credit of the case if i was to presume to help you
733630 you are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere
733631 if you will let me know how your investigations go
733632 i shall be happy to give you any help i can in the meantime i should like to speak to the constable who found the body can you give me his name and address
733633 he is off duty now you will find him at 46 audley court kennington park gate
733634 we shall go and look him up ill tell you one thing which may help you in the case
733635 there has been murder done and the murderer was a man he was more than six feet high was in the prime of life had small feet for his height wore coarse square toed boots and smoked a trichinopoly cigar he came here with his victim in a four wheeled cab which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the finger nails of his right hand were remarkably long these are only a few indications but they may assist you
733636 rache is the german for revenge so dont lose your time looking for miss rachel
733637 as a matter of fact my mind is entirely made up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned
733638 surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave
733639 the very first thing which i observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night there were the marks of the horses hoofs too the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three showing that that was a new shoe since the cab was there after the rain began and was not there at any time during the morning i have gregsons word for that it follows that it must have been there during the night and therefore that it brought those two individuals to the house
733640 why the height of a man in nine cases out of ten can be told from the length of his stride it is a simple calculation enough though there is no use my boring you with figures i had this fellows stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within then i had a way of checking my calculation when a man writes on a wall his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes now that writing was just over six feet from the ground it was childs play
733641 well if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort he cant be quite in the sere and yellow that was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across patent leather boots had gone round and square toes had hopped over there is no mystery about it at all i am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which i advocated in that article is there anything else that puzzles you
733642 the writing on the wall was done with a mans forefinger dipped in blood my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it which would not have been the case if the mans nail had been trimmed i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor it was dark in colour and flakey such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly i have made a special study of cigar ashes in fact i have written a monograph upon the subject i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type
733643 ah that was a more daring shot though i have no doubt that i was right you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair
733644 the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows how came these two men if there were two men into an empty house what has become of the cabman who drove them how could one man compel another to take poison where did the blood come from what was the object of the murderer since robbery had no part in it how came the womans ring there above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamping i confess that i cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts
733645 you sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well
733646 there is much that is still obscure though i have quite made up my mind on the main facts as to poor lestrades discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track by suggesting socialism and secret societies it was not done by a german the a if you noticed was printed somewhat after the german fashion now a real german invariably prints in the latin character so that we may safely say that this was not written by one but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part it was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel im not going to tell you much more of the case doctor you know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick and if i show you too much of my method of working you will come to the conclusion that i am a very ordinary individual after all
733647 you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world
733648 patent leathers 10 and square toes came in the same cab and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible arm in arm in all probability when they got inside they walked up and down the room or rather patent leathers stood still while square toes walked up and down i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited that is shown by the increased length of his strides he was talking all the while and working himself up no doubt into a fury then the tragedy occurred ive told you all i know myself now for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture we have a good working basis however on which to start we must hurry up for i want to go to halles concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon
733649 we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips
733650 i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can
733651 just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred
733652 you stopped and then walked back to the garden gate
733653 though how you come to know it heaven only knows ye see when i got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome that i thought id be none the worse for some one with me i aint afeared of anything on this side o the grave but i thought that maybe it was him that died o the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him the thought gave me a kind o turn and i walked back to the gate to see if i could see murchers lantern but there wasnt no sign of him nor of anyone else
733654 not a livin soul sir nor as much as a dog then i pulled
733655 yes i know all that you saw you walked round the room
733656 it seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should
733657 i am one of the hounds and not the wolf mr gregson or mr lestrade will answer for that go on though what did you do next
733658 i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle that brought murcher and two more to the spot
733659 well it was as far as anybody that could be of any good goes
733660 but never anyone so cryin drunk as that cove he was at the gate when i came out a leanin up agin the railings and a singin at the pitch o his lungs about columbines new fangled banner or some such stuff he couldnt stand far less help
733661 hed ha found hisself in the station if we hadnt been so took up
733662 i should think i did notice them seeing that i had to prop
733663 you didnt happen to see or hear a cab after that
733664 i am afraid rance that you will never rise in the force that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament you might have gained your sergeants stripes last night the man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery and whom we are seeking there is no use of arguing about it now i tell you that it is so come along doctor
733665 just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck and not taking advantage of it
733666 i am rather in the dark still it is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery but why should he come back to the house after leaving it that is not the way of criminals
733667 the ring man the ring that was what he came back for if we have no other way of catching him we can always bait our line with the ring i shall have him doctor ill lay you two to one that i have him i must thank you for it all i might not have gone but for you and so have missed the finest study i ever came across a study in scarlet eh why shouldnt we use a little art jargon theres the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life and our duty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it and now for lunch and then for norman neruda her attack and her bowing are splendid whats that little thing of chopins she plays so magnificently tra la la lira lira lay
733668 do you remember what darwin says about music he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood
733669 ones ideas must be as broad as nature if they are to interpret nature
733670 whats the matter youre not looking quite yourself this brixton road affair has upset you
733671 i ought to be more case hardened after my afghan experiences i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve
733672 i can understand there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror have you seen the evening paper
733673 it gives a fairly good account of the affair it does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a womans wedding ring fell upon the floor it is just as well it does not
733674 i had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair
733675 a plain gold wedding ring found in the roadway between the white hart tavern and holland grove apply dr watson 221b baker street between eight and nine this evening
733676 if i used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair
733677 this will do very well it is almost a facsimile
733678 why the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toes if he does not come himself he will send an accomplice
733679 not at all if my view of the case is correct and i have every reason to believe that it is this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring according to my notion he dropped it while stooping over drebbers body and did not miss it at the time after leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back but found the police already in possession owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning he had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate now put yourself in that mans place on thinking the matter over it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house what would he do then he would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found his eye of course would light upon this he would be overjoyed why should he fear a trap there would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder he would come he will come you shall see him within an hour
733680 oh you can leave me to deal with him then have you any arms
733681 i have my old service revolver and a few cartridges
733682 you had better clean it and load it he will be a desperate man and though i shall take him unawares it is as well to be ready for anything
733683 i have just had an answer to my american telegram my view of the case is the correct one
733684 put your pistol in your pocket when the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way leave the rest to me dont frighten him by looking at him too hard
733685 yes he will probably be here in a few minutes open the door slightly that will do now put the key on the inside thank you this is a queer old book i picked up at a stall yesterday de jure inter gentes published in latin at liege in the lowlands in 1642 charles head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown backed volume was struck off
733686 philippe de croy whoever he may have been on the fly leaf in very faded ink is written ex libris guliolmi whyte i wonder who william whyte was some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer i suppose his writing has a legal twist about it here comes our man i think
733687 sally will be a glad woman this night thats the ring
733688 the brixton road does not lie between any circus and houndsditch
733689 my name is sawyer hers is dennis which tom dennis married
733690 it clearly belongs to your daughter and i am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner
733691 she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him wait up for me
733692 or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery
733693 i wouldnt have the scotland yarders know it for the world
733694 i have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it i can afford to laugh because i know that i will be even with them in the long run
733695 oh i dont mind telling a story against myself that creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot sore presently she came to a halt and hailed a four wheeler which was passing i managed to be close to her so as to hear the address but i need not have been so anxious for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street drive to 13 duncan street houndsditch she cried this begins to look genuine i thought and having seen her safely inside i perched myself behind thats an art which every detective should be an expert at well away we rattled and never drew rein until we reached the street in question i hopped off before we came to the door and strolled down the street in an easy lounging way i saw the cab pull up the driver jumped down and i saw him open the door and stand expectantly nothing came out though when i reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever i listened to there was no sign or trace of his passenger and i fear it will be some time before he gets his fare on inquiring at number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger named keswick and that no one of the name either of sawyer or dennis had ever been heard of there
733696 that that tottering feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion without either you or the driver seeing her
733697 we were the old women to be so taken in it must have been a young man and an active one too besides being an incomparable actor the get up was inimitable he saw that he was followed no doubt and used this means of giving me the slip it shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as i imagined he was but has friends who are ready to risk something for him now doctor you are looking done up take my advice and turn in
733698 i told you that whatever happened lestrade and gregson would be sure to score
733699 oh bless you it doesnt matter in the least if the man
733700 its the baker street division of the detective police force
733701 in future you shall send up wiggins alone to report and the rest of you must wait in the street have you found it wiggins
733702 i hardly expected you would you must keep on until you do
733703 now off you go and come back with a better report next time
733704 theres more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force
733705 the mere sight of an official looking person seals mens lips these youngsters however go everywhere and hear everything they are as sharp as needles too all they want is organisation
733706 is it on this brixton case that you are employing them
733707 yes there is a point which i wish to ascertain it is merely a matter of time hullo we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance here is gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face bound for us i know yes he is stopping there he is
733708 congratulate me i have made the whole thing as clear as day
733709 do you mean that you are on the right track
733710 the right track why sir we have the man under lock and key
733711 we are anxious to know how you managed it will you have some whiskey and water
733712 the tremendous exertions which i have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out not so much bodily exertion you understand as the strain upon the mind you will appreciate that mr sherlock holmes for we are both brain workers
733713 let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result
733714 that that fool lestrade who thinks himself so smart has gone off upon the wrong track altogether he is after the secretary stangerson who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn i have no doubt that he has caught him by this time
733715 ah ill tell you all about it of course doctor watson this is strictly between ourselves the first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this americans antecedents some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered or until parties came forward and volunteered information that is not tobias gregsons way of going to work you remember the hat beside the dead man
733716 you should never neglect a chance however small it may seem
733717 well i went to underwood and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description he looked over his books and came on it at once he had sent the hat to a mr drebber residing at charpentiers boarding establishment torquay terrace thus i got at his address
733718 the mother nodded she didnt seem able to get out a word
733719 at what oclock did mr drebber leave your house for the
733720 at eight oclock she said gulping in her throat to keep
733721 and was that the last which you saw of him
733722 a terrible change came over the womans face as i asked the
733723 there was silence for a moment and then the daughter spoke
733724 no good can ever come of falsehood mother she said
733725 arthur would rather that we spoke the truth the girl
733726 you had best tell me all about it now i said
733727 on your head be it alice cried her mother and then
733728 your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts
733729 perhaps alice you had better leave us together she said
733730 mr drebber has been with us nearly three weeks he and
733731 but why did you stand all this i asked i suppose that
733732 my heart grew light when i saw him drive away my son is
733733 and there is no law to stop you i have money enough and to spare never mind the old girl here but come along with me now straight away you shall live like a princess
733734 i dont think that fine fellow will trouble us again
733735 i will just go after him and see what he does with himself
733736 this statement came from mrs charpentiers lips with many gasps and pauses at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words i made shorthand notes of all that she said however so that there should be no possibility of a mistake
733737 i saw that the whole case hung upon one point fixing her
733738 no he has a latch key and he let himself in
733739 i do not know she answered turning white to her very lips
733740 of course after that there was nothing more to be done i found out where lieutenant charpentier was took two officers with me and arrested him when i touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us he answered us as bold as brass i suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel drebber he said we had said nothing to him about it so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect
733741 he still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed drebber it was a stout oak cudgel
733742 well my theory is that he followed drebber as far as the brixton road when there a fresh altercation arose between them in the course of which drebber received a blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which killed him without leaving any mark the night was so wet that no one was about so charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house as to the candle and the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent
733743 really gregson you are getting along we shall make something of you yet
733744 i flatter myself that i have managed it rather neatly
733745 the young man volunteered a statement in which he said that after following drebber some time the latter perceived him and took a cab in order to get away from him on his way home he met an old shipmate and took a long walk with him on being asked where this old shipmate lived he was unable to give any satisfactory reply i think the whole case fits together uncommonly well what amuses me is to think of lestrade who had started off upon the wrong scent i am afraid he wont make much of 15 why by jove heres the very man himself
733746 i thought you would come to that conclusion have you managed to find the secretary mr joseph stangerson
733747 was murdered at hallidays private hotel about six oclock this morning
733748 i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war
733749 are you are you sure of this piece of intelligence
733750 would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done
733751 i freely confess that i was of the opinion that stangerson was concerned in the death of drebber this fresh development has shown me that i was completely mistaken full of the one idea i set myself to find out what had become of the secretary they had been seen together at euston station about half past eight on the evening of the third at two in the morning drebber had been found in the brixton road the question which confronted me was to find out how stangerson had been employed between 8 30 and the time of the crime and what had become of him afterwards i telegraphed to liverpool giving a description of the man and warning them to keep a watch upon the american boats i then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging houses in the vicinity of euston you see i argued that if drebber and his companion had become separated the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning
733752 they would be likely to agree on some meeting place beforehand
733753 so it proved i spent the whole of yesterday evening in
733754 no doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting
733755 he is upstairs in bed he wished to be called at nine
733756 i will go up and see him at once i said
733757 it seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded the boots volunteered to show me the room it was on the second floor and there was a small corridor leading up to it the boots pointed out the door to me and was about to go downstairs again when i saw something that made me feel sickish in spite of my twenty years experience from under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side i gave a cry which brought the boots back he nearly fainted when he saw it the door was locked on the inside but we put our shoulders to it and knocked it in the window of the room was open and beside the window all huddled up lay the body of a man in his nightdress he was quite dead and had been for some time for his limbs were rigid and cold when we turned him over the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of joseph stangerson the cause of death was a deep stab in the left side which must have penetrated the heart and now comes the strangest part of the affair what do you suppose was above the murdered man
733758 a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder for we found blood stained water in the basin where he had washed his hands and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife
733759 did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer
733760 nothing stangerson had drebbers purse in his pocket but it seems that this was usual as he did all the paying there was eighty odd pounds in it but nothing had been taken whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes robbery is certainly not one of them there were no papers or memoranda in the murdered mans pocket except a single telegram dated from cleveland about a month ago and containing the words j h is in europe there was no name appended to this message
733761 nothing of any importance the mans novel with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed and his pipe was on a chair beside him there was a glass of water on the table and on the window sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills
733762 all the threads which have formed such a tangle there are of course details to be filled in but i am as certain of all the main facts from the time that drebber parted from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if i had seen them with my own eyes i will give you a proof of my knowledge could you lay your hand upon those pills
733763 i took them and the purse and the telegram intending to have them put in a place of safety at the police station it was the merest chance my taking these pills for i am bound to say that i do not attach any importance to them
733764 from their lightness and transparency i should imagine that they are soluble in water
733765 now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday
733766 i will now cut one of these pills in two
733767 one half we return into the box for future purposes the other half i will place in this wine glass in which is a teaspoonful of water you perceive that our friend the doctor is right and that it readily dissolves
733768 i cannot see however what it has to do with the death of mr joseph stangerson
733769 patience my friend patience you will find in time that it has everything to do with it i shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough
733770 it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson and yet they are inert what can it mean surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false it is impossible and yet this wretched dog is none the worse ah i have it i have it
733771 i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all
733772 because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outre 17 and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so
733773 we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man and that you have your own methods of working we want something more than mere theory and preaching now though it is a case of taking the man i have made my case out and it seems i was wrong young charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair lestrade went after his man stangerson and it appears that he was wrong too you have thrown out hints here and hints there and seem to know more than we do but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business can you name the man who did it
733774 we have both tried and we have both failed you have remarked more than once since i have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require surely you will not withhold it any longer
733775 you can put that consideration out of the question you have asked me if i know the name of the assassin i do the mere knowing of his name is a small thing however compared with the power of laying our hands upon him this i expect very shortly to do i have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who is supported as i have had occasion to prove by another who is as clever as himself as long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city without meaning to hurt either of your feelings i am bound to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that is why i have not asked your assistance if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i am prepared for at present i am ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations i shall do so
733776 see how beautifully the spring works they fasten in an instant
733777 if we can only find the man to put them on
733778 the cabman may as well help me with my boxes just ask him to step up wiggins
733779 let me introduce you to mr jefferson hope the murderer of enoch drebber and of joseph stangerson
733780 it will serve to take him to scotland yard and now gentlemen
733781 we have reached the end of our little mystery you are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now and there is no danger that i will refuse to answer them
733782 why not here as well as in a feather bed twenty years hence
733783 funny she didnt say good bye she most always did if she was just goin over to aunties for tea and now shes been away three days say its awful dry aint it aint there no water nor nothing to eat
733784 no there aint nothing dearie youll just need to be patient awhile and then youll be all right put your head up agin me like that and then youll feel bullier it aint easy to talk when your lips is like leather but i guess id best let you know how the cards lie whats that youve got
733785 when we goes back to home ill give them to brother bob
733786 you just wait a bit i was going to tell you though you remember when we left the river
733787 well we reckoned wed strike another river soon dye see
733788 no nor drink and mr bender he was the fust to go and then indian pete and then mrs mcgregor and then johnny hones and then dearie your mother
733789 yes they all went except you and me then i thought there was some chance of water in this direction so i heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together it dont seem as though weve improved matters theres an almighty small chance for us now
733790 do you mean that we are going to die too
733791 you gave me such a fright why of course now as long as we die well be with mother again
733792 and you too ill tell her how awful good youve been ill bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water and a lot of buckwheat cakes hot and toasted on both sides like bob and me was fond of how long will it be first
733793 he made the country down in illinois and he made the missouri
733794 i guess somebody else made the country in these parts its not nearly so well done they forgot the water and the trees
733795 it dont matter it aint quite regular but he wont mind that you bet you say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the plains
733796 i haint said none since i was half the height o that gun i guess its never too late you say them out and ill stand by and come in on the choruses
733797 youve got to put your hands up like this it makes you feel kind o good
733798 to the right of the sierra blanco so we shall reach the rio grande
733799 he who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon his own chosen people
733800 we have passed the pawnees and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains
733801 leave your horses below and we will await you here
733802 me and that little un are all thats left o twenty one people the rest is all dead o thirst and hunger away down in the south
733803 shes mine cause i saved her no man will take her from me shes lucy ferrier from this day on who are you though
733804 we are the persecuted children of god the chosen of the angel merona
733805 he appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye
733806 we are of those who believe in those sacred writings drawn in egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold which were handed unto the holy joseph smith at palmyra we have come from nauvoo in the state of illinois where we had founded our temple we have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless even though it be the heart of the desert
733807 we do not know the hand of god is leading us under the person of our prophet you must come before him he shall say what is to be done with you
733808 it can only be as believers in our own creed we shall have no wolves in our fold better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit will you come with us on these terms
733809 give him food and drink and the child likewise let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed we have delayed long enough forward on on to zion
733810 in a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues in the meantime remember that now and for ever you are of our religion brigham young has said it and he has spoken with the voice of joseph smith which is the voice of god
733811 whoever would have thought that poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows
733812 i saw you ride down from his house when you see him ask him if he remembers the jefferson hopes of st louis if hes the same ferrier my father and he were pretty thick
733813 weve been in the mountains for two months and are not over and above in visiting condition he must take us as he finds us
733814 he has a good deal to thank you for and so have i
733815 hes awful fond of me if those cows had jumped on me hed have never got over it
733816 you well i dont see that it would make much matter to you anyhow you aint even a friend of ours
733817 of course you are a friend now you must come and see us now i must push along or father wont trust me with his business any more good bye
733818 i wont ask you to come with me now but will you be ready to come when i am here again
733819 a couple of months at the outside i will come and claim you then my darling theres no one who can stand between us
733820 he has given his consent provided we get these mines working all right i have no fear on that head
733821 oh well of course if you and father have arranged it all theres no more to be said
733822 it is settled then the longer i stay the harder it will be to go they are waiting for me at the canon good bye my own darling good bye in two months you shall see me
733823 the true believers have been good friends to you we picked you up when you were starving in the desert we shared our food with you led you safe to the chosen valley gave you a goodly share of land and allowed you to wax rich under our protection is not this so
733824 in return for all this we asked but one condition that was that you should embrace the true faith and conform in every way to its usages this you promised to do and this if common report says truly you have neglected
733825 have i not given to the common fund have i not attended at the temple have i not
733826 but women were few and there were many who had better claims than i i was not a lonely man i had my daughter to attend to my wants
733827 it is of that daughter that i would speak to you
733828 she has grown to be the flower of utah and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land
733829 there are stories of her which i would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some gentile this must be the gossip of idle tongues what is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted joseph smith let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a gentile she commits a grievous sin this being so it is impossible that you who profess the holy creed should suffer your daughter to violate it
733830 upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested so it has been decided in the sacred council of four the girl is young and we would not have her wed grey hairs neither would we deprive her of all choice we elders have many heifers but our children must also be provided stangerson has a son and drebber has a son and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house let her choose between them they are young and rich and of the true faith what say you to that
733831 my daughter is very young she is scarce of an age to marry
733832 at the end of that time she shall give her answer
733833 that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the sierra blanco than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the holy four
733834 his voice rang through the house oh father father what shall we do
733835 well fix it up somehow or another you dont find your fancy kind o lessening for this chap do you
733836 no of course not i shouldnt care to hear you say you did hes a likely lad and hes a christian which is more than these folk here in spite o all their praying and preaching theres a party starting for nevada to morrow and ill manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in if i know anything o that young man hell be back here with a speed that would whip electro telegraphs
733837 when he comes he will advise us for the best but it is for you that i am frightened dear one hears one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the prophet something terrible always happens to them
733838 it will be time to look out for squalls when we do we have a clear month before us at the end of that i guess we had best shin out of utah
733839 we will raise as much as we can in money and let the rest go to tell the truth lucy it isnt the first time i have thought of doing it i dont care about knuckling under to any man as these folk do to their darned prophet im a free born american and its all new to me guess im too old to learn if he comes browsing about this farm he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction
733840 wait till jefferson comes and well soon manage that in the meantime dont you fret yourself my dearie and dont get your eyes swelled up else hell be walking into me when he sees you theres nothing to be afeared about and theres no danger at all
733841 this here is the son of elder drebber and im joseph stangerson who travelled with you in the desert when the lord stretched out his hand and gathered you into the true fold
733842 as he will all the nations in his own good time
733843 at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her as i have but four wives and brother drebber here has seven it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one
733844 the question is not how many wives we have but how many we can keep my father has now given over his mills to me and i am the richer man
733845 when the lord removes my father i shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory then i am your elder and am higher in the church
733846 when my daughter summons you you can come but until then i dont want to see your faces again
733847 there is the door and there is the window which do you care to use
733848 let me know when you have settled which it is to be
733849 you have defied the prophet and the council of four you shall rue it to the end of your days
733850 the hand of the lord shall be heavy upon you
733851 i would sooner see you in your grave my girl than the wife of either of them
733852 yes it will not be long before he comes the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be
733853 twenty nine days are given you for amendment and then
733854 how you scared me whatever made you come in like that
733855 i have had no time for bite or sup for eight and forty hours
733856 that is well the house is watched on every side that is why i crawled my way up to it they may be darned sharp but theyre not quite sharp enough to catch a washoe hunter
733857 there are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles
733858 i have a respect for you but if you were alone in this business id think twice before i put my head into such a hornets nest its lucy that brings me here and before harm comes on her i guess there will be one less o the hope family in utah
733859 to morrow is your last day and unless you act to night you are lost i have a mule and two horses waiting in the eagle ravine how much money have you
733860 that will do i have as much more to add to it we must push for carson city through the mountains you had best wake lucy it is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house
733861 the front and back entrances are watched but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields once on the road we are only two miles from the ravine where the horses are waiting by daybreak we should be half way through the mountains
733862 if they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us
733863 pass it on to him and from him to the others nine to seven
733864 we are through the line of sentinels everything depends on speed hurry on
733865 everything depends upon our speed once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives
733866 it is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you there is a warrant against you from the holy four for assisting the ferriers away
733867 you must know something of this matter cowper i conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions we have always been friends for gods sake dont refuse to answer me
733868 be quick the very rocks have ears and the trees eyes
733869 she was married yesterday to young drebber hold up man hold up you have no life left in you
733870 married yesterday thats what those flags are for on the endowment house there was some words between young drebber and young stangerson as to which was to have her theyd both been in the party that followed them and stangerson had shot her father which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council drebbers party was the stronger so the prophet gave her over to him no one wont have her very long though for i saw death in her face yesterday she is more like a ghost than a woman are you off then
733871 i guess youre going to take me to the police station
733872 my cabs at the door if youll loose my legs ill walk down to it im not so light to lift as i used to be
733873 if theres a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you are the man for it
733874 the way you kept on my trail was a caution
733875 good and gregson can come inside with me you too doctor you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us
733876 the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week
733877 in the mean time mr jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say i must warn you that your words will be taken down and may be used against you
733878 you neednt look startled it isnt suicide i am thinking of are you a doctor
733879 i went to a doctor last week about it and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed it has been getting worse for years i got it from over exposure and under feeding among the salt lake mountains ive done my work now and i dont care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me i dont want to be remembered as a common cut throat
733880 in that case it is clearly our duty in the interests of justice to take his statement
733881 you are at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be taken down
733882 this aneurism of mine makes me easily tired and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters im on the brink of the grave and i am not likely to lie to you every word i say is the absolute truth and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me
733883 it dont much matter to you why i hated these men
733884 its enough that they were guilty of the death of two human
733885 that girl that i spoke of was to have married me twenty
733886 they were rich and i was poor so that it was no easy matter
733887 it was some time before i found out where my two gentlemen
733888 they were very near doing it for all that go where they
733889 they were very cunning though they must have thought that
733890 at last one evening i was driving up and down torquay
733891 the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come
733892 he walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops staying for nearly half an hour in the last of them when he came out he staggered in his walk and was evidently pretty well on there was a hansom just in front of me and he hailed it i followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but i went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house he entered it and his hansom drove away give me a glass of water if you please my mouth gets dry with the talking
733893 when i had him fairly inside my cab my heart jumped so with
733894 dont imagine that i intended to kill him in cold blood
733895 it was nearer one than twelve and a wild bleak night
733896 there was not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard
733897 i suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had
733898 well soon have a light i said striking a match and
733899 he gazed at me with bleared drunken eyes for a moment and
733900 you dog i said i have hunted you from salt lake city to
733901 what do you think of lucy ferrier now i cried locking
733902 there is no murder i answered who talks of murdering
733903 it was not i who killed her father he cried
733904 but it was you who broke her innocent heart i shrieked
733905 he cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy but i
733906 the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken
733907 that was how enoch drebber came to his end all i had to do
733908 i have little more to say and its as well for i am about done up i went on cabbing it for a day or so intending to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to america i was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called jefferson hope and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221b baker street i went round suspecting no harm and the next thing i knew this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists and as neatly snackled 27 as ever i saw in my life thats the whole of my story gentlemen you may consider me to be a murderer but i hold that i am just as much an officer of justice as you are
733909 there is only one point on which i should like a little more information
733910 who was your accomplice who came for the ring which i advertised
733911 but i dont get other people into trouble i saw your advertisement and i thought it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i wanted my friend volunteered to go and see i think youll own he did it smartly
733912 the forms of the law must be complied with on thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates and your attendance will be required until then i will be responsible for him
733913 i dont see that they had very much to do with his capture
733914 what you do in this world is a matter of no consequence
733915 the question is what can you make people believe that you have done never mind
733916 i would not have missed the investigation for anything there has been no better case within my recollection simple as it was there were several most instructive points about it
733917 the proof of its intrinsic simplicity is that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions i was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days
733918 i have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance in solving a problem of this sort the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards that is a very useful accomplishment and a very easy one but people do not practise it much in the every day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards and so the other comes to be neglected there are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically
733919 i hardly expected that you would let me see if i can make it clearer most people if you describe a train of events to them will tell you what the result would be they can put those events together in their minds and argue from them that something will come to pass there are few people however who if you told them a result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result this power is what i mean when i talk of reasoning backwards or analytically
733920 now this was a case in which you were given the result and
733921 this was the first point gained i then walked slowly down
733922 and now came the great question as to the reason why
733923 i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room
733924 having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had
733925 i had already determined in my own mind that the man who had
733926 if he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be on the contrary from his point of view any sudden chance would be likely to draw attention to himself he would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duties there was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one i therefore organized my street arab detective corps and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in london until they ferreted out the man that i wanted how well they succeeded and how quickly i took advantage of it are still fresh in your recollection the murder of stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have been prevented through it as you know i came into possession of the pills the existence of which i had already surmised you see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw
733927 your merits should be publicly recognized you should publish an account of the case if you wont i will for you
733928 have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who was suspected of the murder of mr enoch drebber and of mr joseph stangerson the details of the case will probably be never known now though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part it seems that both the victims belonged in their younger days to the latter day saints and hope the deceased prisoner hails also from salt lake city if the case has had no other effect it at least brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home and not to carry them on to british soil it is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well known scotland yard officials messrs lestrade and gregson the man was apprehended it appears in the rooms of a certain mr sherlock holmes who has himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detective line and who with such instructors may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill it is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services
733929 thats the result of all our study in scarlet to get them a testimonial
733930 he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness
733931 as he spoke his nimble fingers were flying here there
733932 in the next century this will be astonishingly perceptible to the minds of men i will also make a statement which you will surely see verified before the clear revelation of spirit communication there will be a terrible war in different parts of the world the entire world must be purified and cleansed before mortal can see through his spiritual vision his friends on this side and it will take just this line of action to bring about a state of perfection friend kindly think of this
733933 we are here to educate and to elevate not to guess riddles
733934 the religious frame of mind not the critical is what we wish to inculcate
733935 you have not got the fundamental truth into your head
733936 that truth is that every spirit in the flesh passes over to the next world exactly as it is with no change whatever this world is full of weak or foolish people so is the next you need not mix with them any more than you do in this world one chooses ones companions but suppose a man in this world who had lived in his house alone and never mixed with his fellows was at last to put his head out of the window to see what sort of place it was what would happen some naughty boy would probably say something rude anyhow he would see nothing of the wisdom or greatness of the world he would draw his head in thinking it was a very poor place that is just what you have done in a mixed seance with no definite aim you have thrust your head into the next world and you have met some naughty boys go forward and try to reach something better
733937 rouse yourselves stand by be at attention here are signs for you they will lead up to the message which god wishes to send
733938 it is terrible terrible and will have a great influence on the war
733939 there is a lady here she is leaning upon an older woman she keeps saying morphia three times she has said it her mind was clouded she did not mean it morphia
733940 here he worked no wonders because the people were wanting in faith
733941 who has touched me much virtue has passed out of me
733942 that is not the son i lost i want his yellow hair his quick smile his little moods that i know so well
733943 if they exist why dont they do this or that
733944 i saw the circle but was not sure about the triangle
733945 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god
733946 it is hard to think your sons are dead but such a lot of people do think so it is revolting to hear the boys tell you how no one speaks of them ever it hurts me through and through
733947 spiritualism has been for me in common with many others such a lifting of the mental horizon and letting in of the heavens such a formation of faith into facts that i can only compare life without it to sailing on board ship with hatches battened down and being kept a prisoner living by the light of a candle and then suddenly on some splendid starry night allowed to go on deck for the first time to see the stupendous mechanism of the heavens all aglow with the glory of god
733948 after reading your article i was struck almost startled by the circumstance that the statements which had purported to be made to me regarding conditions after death coincided i think almost to the smallest detail with those you set out as the result of your collation of material obtained from a great number of sources i cannot think there was anything in my antecedent reading to account for this coincidence i had certainly read nothing you had published on the subject i had purposely avoided raymond and books like it in order not to vitiate my own results and the proceedings of the s p r which i had read at that time do not touch as you know upon after death conditions at any rate i obtained at various times statements as my contemporary notes show to the effect that in this persisting state of existence they have bodies which though imperceptible by our senses are as solid to them as ours to us that these bodies are based on the general characteristies of our present bodies but beautified that they have no age no pain no rich and poor that they wear clothes and take nourishment that they do not sleep though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called lying asleep a condition it just occurs to me which seems to correspond roughly with the hypnoidal state that after a period which is usually shorter than the average life time here they pass to some further state of existence that people of similar thoughts tastes and feelings gravitate together that married couples do not necessarily reunite but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization that immediately after death people pass into a semi conscious rest state lasting various periods that they are unable to experience bodily pain but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety that a painful death is absolutely unknown that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after state and that their life altogether is intensely happy and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here i got no reference to work by that word but much to the various interests that were said to occupy them that is probably only another way of saying the same thing work with us has come usually to mean work to live and that i was emphatically informed was not the case with them that all the requirements of life were somehow mysteriously provided neither did i get any reference to a definite temporary penal state but i gathered that people begin there at the point of intellectual and moral development where they leave off here and since their state of happiness was based mainly upon sympathy those who came over in a low moral condition failed at first for various lengths of time to have the capacity to appreciate and enjoy it
733949 a week after my fathers funeral i was writing a business letter when something seemed to intervene between my hand and the motor centres of my brain and the hand wrote at an amazing rate a letter signed with my fathers signature and purporting to come from him i was upset and my right side and arm became cold and numb for a year after this letters came frequently and always at unexpected times i never knew what they contained until i examined them with a magnifying glass they were microscopic and they contained a vast amount of matter with which it was impossible for me to be acquainted
733950 as for myself i am as convinced that my father
733951 i have compared the diction and vocabulary of these letters with those employed in my own writing i am not unknown as a magazine contributor and i find no points of similarity between the two
733952 quel est le site que vous utilisez le plus souvent pour lire les derni res nouvelles
733953 i can hardly doubt that it is porlocks writing though i have seen it only twice before the greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive but if it is porlock then it must be something of the very first importance
733954 porlock watson is a nom de plume a mere identification mark but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality in a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming mil lions of this great city porlock is important not for himself but for the great man with whom he is in touch picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lion anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable not only formidable watson but sinister in the highest degree sinister that is where he comes within my purview you have heard me speak of professor moriarty
733955 i was about to say as he is unknown to the public
733956 you are devel oping a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself but in calling moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law and there lie the glory and the wonder of it the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the control ling brain of the underworld a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations thats the man but so aloof is he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and self effacement that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your years pension as a solatium for his wounded charac ter is he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of an asteroid a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it is this a man to traduce foul mouthed doctor and slandered professor such would be your respective roles thats genius watson but if i am spared by lesser men our day will surely come
733957 ah yes the so called porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment porlock is not quite a sound link between ourselves he is the only flaw in that chain so far as i have been able to test it
733958 exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note sent to him by devious methods he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime i cannot doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that i indicate
733959 but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher
733960 because there are many ciphers which i would read as easily as i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it but this is different it is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book until i am told which page and which book i am powerless
733961 clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question
733962 yow native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cun ning which is the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you are undone as it is both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it our second post is now overdue and i shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as is more probable the very volume to which these figures refer
733963 dear me this is very disappointing i fear watson that all
733964 i will go no further in this maner it is too dangerous he suspects me i can see that he suspects me he came to me quite unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this enve lope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher i was able to cover it up if he had seen it it would have gone hard with me but i read suspicion in his eyes please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you fred porlock
733965 there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience knowing himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the others eyes
733966 no less when any of that party talk about he you know whom they mean there is one predominant he for all of them
733967 hum thats a large question when you have one of the first brains of europe up against you and all the powers of darkness at his back there are infinite possibilities anyhow friend porlock is evidently scared out of his senses kindly com pare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope which was done he tells us before this ill omened visit the one is clear and firm the other hardly legible
733968 why did he write at all why did he not simply drop it
733969 because he feared i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him
733970 its pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it
733971 perhaps there are points which have escaped your machiavellian intellect let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason this mans reference is to a book that is our point of departure
733972 let us see then if we can narrow it down as i focus my mind upon it it seems rather less impenetrable what indications have we as to this book
733973 well well it is surely not quite so bad as that the cipher message begins with a large 534 does it not we may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers so our book has already become a large book which is surely something gained what other indications have we as to the nature of this large book the next sign is c2 what do you make of that watson
733974 hardly that watson you will i am sure agree with me that if the page be given the number of the chapter is immate rial also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have been really intolerable
733975 brilliant watson you are scintillating this morning if it is not column then i am very much deceived so now you see we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable iength since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety third have we reached the limits of what reason can supply
733976 surely you do yourself an injustice one more coruscation my dear watson yet another brain wave had the volume been an unusual one he would have sent it to me instead of that he had intended before his plans were nipped to send me the clue in this envelope he says so in his note this would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought i would have no difficulty in finding for myself he had it and he imagined that i would have it too in short watson it is a very common book
733977 so we have contracted our field of search to a large book printed in double columns and in common use
733978 good watson good but not if i may say so quite good enough even if i accepted the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to iie at the elbow of one of moriartys associates besides the editions of holy writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination this is clearly a book which is standardized he knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534
733979 exactly therein lies our salvation our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess
733980 there are difficulties watson the vocabulary of bradshaw is nervous and terse but limited the selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages we will eliminate bradshaw the dictionary is i fear inadmissible for the same reason what then is left
733981 excellent watson i am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot an almanac let us consider the claims of whitakers almanac it is in common use it has the requisite number of pages it is in double column though reserved in its earlier vocabulary it becomes if i remember right quite garru lous towards the end
733982 here is page 534 column two a substantial block of print dealing i perceive with the trade and resources of british india jot down the words watson number thirteen is mahratta not i fear a very auspicious beginning number one hundred and twenty seven is government which at least makes sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty now let us try again what does the mahratta government do alas the next word is we are undone my good watson it is finished
733983 we pay the price watson for being too up to date
733984 we are before our time and suffer the usual penalties
733985 danger ha ha capital put that down watson there is danger may come very soon one then we have the name douglas rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence is pressing there watson what do you think of pure reason and its fruit if the green grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it
733986 when you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning you can hardly expect to get everything you want you are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent the purport is perfectly clear some deviltry is intended against one douglas whoever he may be residing as stated a rich country gentleman he is sure confidence was as near as he could get to confident that it is pressing there is our result and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was
733987 i wish you luck with your worm i fear this means that there is some mischief afoot
733988 if you said hope instead of fear it would be nearer the truth im thinking mr holmes
733989 birlstone whats this mr holmes man its witchcraft where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names
733990 it is a cipher that dr watson and i have had occasion to solve but why whats amiss with the names
733991 that mr douglas of birlstone manor house was horribly murdered last night
733992 interested mr mac but hardly surprised why should i be surprised i receive an anonymous communication from a quar ter which i know to be important warning me that danger threatens a certain person within an hour i learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead i am interested but as you observe i am not surprised
733993 i had come to ask you if you cared to come with me you and your friend here but from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in london
733994 the papers will be full of the birlstone mystery in a day or two but wheres the mystery if there is a man in london who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred we have only to lay our hands on that man and the rest will follow
733995 no doubt mr mac but how do you propose to lay your hands on the so called porlock
733996 posted in camberwell that doesnt help us much name you say is assumed not much to go on certainly didnt you say that you have sent him money
733997 did you ever trouble to see who called for them
733998 because i always keep faith i had promised when he first wrote that i would not try to trace him
733999 i wont conceal from you mr holmes that we think in the c i d that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor i made some inquiries myself about the matter he seems to be a verly respectable learned and talented sort of man
734000 im glad youve got so far as to recognize the talent
734001 man you cant but recognize it after i heard your view i made it my business to see him i had a chat with him on eclipses how the talk got that way i canna think but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe and made it all clear in a minute he lent me a book but i dont mind saying that it was a bit above my head though i had a good aberdeen upbringing hed have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn like way of talking when he put his hand on my shoul der as we were parting it was like a fathers blessing before you go out into the cold cruel world
734002 great tell me friend macdonald this pleasing and touching interview was i suppose in the professors study
734003 sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow
734004 well it was evening but i mind that the lamp was turned on my face
734005 it would be did you happen to observe a picture over the professors head
734006 i dont miss much mr holmes maybe i learned that from you yes i saw the picture a young woman with her head on her hands peeping at you sideways
734007 was a french artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800 i allude of course to his working career modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries
734008 all that i am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the birlstone mystery in fact it may in a sense be called the very centre of it
734009 your thoughts move a bit too quick for me mr holmes you leave out a link or two and i cant get over the gap what in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at birlstone
734010 even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by greuze entitled la jeune fille a lagneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs more than forty thousand pounds at the portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind
734011 that the professors salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of refer ence it is seven hundred a year
734012 talk away mr holmes im just loving it its fine
734013 ive a cab at the door and it wont take us twenty minutes to victoria but about this picture i thought you told me once mr holmes that you had never met professor moriarty
734014 ah thats another matter i have been three times in his rooms twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came once well i can hardly tell about the once to an official detective it was on the last occasion that i took the liberty of running over his papers with the most unexpected results
734015 absolutely nothing that was what amazed me however you have now seen the point of the picture it shows him to be a very wealthy man how did he acquire wealth he is unmarried his younger brother is a station master in the west of england his chair is worth seven hundred a year and he owns a greuze
734016 you mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion
734017 exactly of course i have other reasons for thinking so dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature is lurking i only mention the greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation
734018 well mr holmes i admit that what you say is interesting its more than interesting its just wonderful but let us have it a little clearer if you can is it forgery coining burglary where does the money come from
734019 well the name has a familiar sound someone in a novel was he not i dont take much stock of detectives in novels chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them thats just inspiration not business
734020 jonathan wild wasnt a detective and he wasnt in a novel he was a master criminal and he lived last century 1750 or thereabouts
734021 then hes no use to me im a practical man
734022 mr mac the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime everything comes in circles even professor moriarty jonathan wild was the hidden force of the london criminals to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission the old wheel turns and the same spoke comes up its all been done before and will be again ill tell you one or two things about moriarty which may interest you
734023 i happen to know who is the first link in his chain a chain with this napoleon gone wrong at one end and a hundred broken fighting men pickpockets blackmailers and card sharpers at the other with every sort of crime in between his chief of staff is colonel sebastian moran as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself what do you think he pays him
734024 six thousand a year thats paying for brains you see the american business principle i learned that detail quite by chance its more than the prime minister gets that gives you an idea of moriartys gains and of the scale on which he works another point i made it my business to hunt down some of moriartys checks lately just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with they were drawn on six different banks does that make any impression on your mind
734025 that he wanted no gossip about his wealth no single man should know what he had i have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts the bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit lyonnais as likely as not sometime when you have a year or two to spare i commend to you the study of professor moriarty
734026 youve got us side tracked with your interesting anecdotes mr holmes what really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the profes sor and the crime that you get from the warning received through the man porlock can we for our present practical needs get any further than that
734027 we may form some conception as to the motives of the crime it is as i gather from your original remarks an inexplica ble or at least an unexplained murder now presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be there might be two different motives in the first place i may tell you that moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people his discipline is tremendous there is only one punishment in his code it is death now we might suppose that this murdered man this douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the subordinates had in some way betrayed the chief his punishment followed and would be known to all if only to put the fear of death into them
734028 the other is that it has been engineered by moriarty in the ordinary course of business was there any robbery
734029 if so it would of course be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils or he may have been paid so much down to manage it either is possible but whichever it may be or if it is some third combination it is down at birlstone that we must seek the solution i know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him
734030 my word its later than i thought i can give you gentlemen five minutes for preparation and that is all
734031 while we are on our way mr mac i will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it
734032 official requisition for your services is in separate enve lope this is for your private eye wire me what train in the morning you can get for birlstone and i will meet it or have it met if i am too occupied this case is a snorter dont waste a moment in getting started if you can bring mr holmes please do so for he will find something after his own heart we would think the whole thing had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasnt a dead man in the middle of it my word it is a snorter
734033 no sir white mason is a very live man if i am any judge
734034 only that he will give us every detail when we meet
734035 then how did you get at mr douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered
734036 that was in the inclosed official report it didnt say horri ble thats not a recognized official term it gave the name john douglas it mentioned that his injuries had been in the head from the discharge of a shotgun it also mentioned the hour of the alarm which was close on to midnight last night it added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder but that no arrest had been made and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features thats absolutely all we have at present mr holmes
734037 then with your permission we will leave it at that mr mac the temptation to form premature theories upon insuffi cient data is the bane of our profession i can see only two things for certain at present a great brain in london and a dead man in sussex its the chain between that we are going to trace
734038 but my word i had rather not be the man that crossed him
734039 ill answer for that you see it all exactly as i found it
734040 it was just half past eleven i had not begun to undress and i was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when i heard the report it was not very loud it seemed to be muffled i rushed down i dont suppose it was thirty seconds before i was in the room
734041 yes it was open poor douglas was lying as you see him his bedroom candle was burning on the table it was i who lit the lamp some minutes afterward
734042 no i heard mrs douglas coming down the stair behind me and i rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight mrs allen the housekeeper came and took her away ames had arrived and we ran back into the room once more
734043 but surely i have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all
734044 then how could any murderer have got away it is out of the question mr douglas must have shot himself
734045 then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime he must have been in the water at that very moment
734046 i have not a doubt of it i wish to heaven that i had rushed to the window but the curtain screened it as you can see and so it never occurred to me then i heard the step of mrs douglas and i could not let her enter the room it would have been too horrible
734047 ive never seen such injuries since the birlstone railway smash
734048 its all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat but what i ask you is how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up
734049 that it was usually raised at sunset that would be nearer half past four than six at this time of year
734050 i couldnt raise it until they went then i wound it up myself
734051 if anyone came from outside if they did they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since until mr douglas came into the room after eleven
734052 that is so mr douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right that brought him in here the man was waiting and shot him then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him thats how i read it for nothing else will fit the facts
734053 v v 341 i can make no sense of that
734054 whats v v somebodys initials maybe what have you got there dr wood
734055 i saw him myself standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it that accounts for the hammer
734056 wed best put it back on the rug where we found it
734057 it will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing it will be a london job before it is finished
734058 im bound to say this bears out your theory mr barker it looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn and before six when the bridge was raised he slipped into this room because it was the first that he saw there was no other place where he could hide so he popped in behind this curtain that all seems clear enough it is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house but mr douglas chanced to come upon him so he murdered him and escaped
734059 but i say arent we wasting precious time couldnt we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away
734060 there are no trains before six in the morning so he cant get away by rail if he goes by road with his legs all dripping its odds that someone will notice him anyhow i cant leave here myself until i am relieved but i think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand
734061 i never saw anything like it the man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle what is the meaning of this
734062 but i have seen the mark on douglas many times this last ten years
734063 many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves i have noticed that very mark ive often wondered what it could be
734064 then it has nothing to do with the crime anyhow
734065 but its a rum thing all the same everything about this case is rum well what is it now
734066 yes indeed master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand that ring with the rough nugget on it was above it and the twisted snake ring on the third finger theres the nugget and theres the snake but the wedding ring is gone
734067 then the murderer or whoever it was first took off this ring you call the nugget ring then the wedding ring and afterwards put the nugget ring back again
734068 seems to me the sooner we get london on to this case the better
734069 white mason is a smart man no local job has ever been too much for white mason it wont be long now before he is here to help us but i expect well have to look to london before we are through anyhow im not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me
734070 well have the pressmen down like flies when they under stand it im hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails there has been nothing like this that i can remember there are some bits that will come home to you mr holmes or i am mistaken and you also dr watson for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish your room is at the westville arms theres no other place but i hear that it is clean and good the man will carry your bags this way gentlemen if you please
734071 most remarkable i can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar
734072 were well up with the times in sussex ive told you now how matters were up to the time when i took over from sergeant wilson between three and four this morning my word i made the old mare go but i need not have been in such a hurry as it turned out for there was nothing immediate that i could do sergeant wilson had all the facts i checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own
734073 well i first had the hammer examined there was dr wood there to help me we found no signs of violence upon it i was hoping that if mr douglas defended himself with the ham mer he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat but there was no stain
734074 there has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer
734075 quite so it doesnt prove it wasnt used but there might have been stains and that would have helped us as a matter of fact there were none then i examined the gun they were buckshot cartridges and as sergeant wilson pointed out the triggers were wired together so that if you pulled on the hinder one both barrels were discharged whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man the sawed gun was not more than two foot long one could carry it easily under ones coat there was no complete makers name but the printed letters p e n were on the fluting between the barrels and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw
734076 a big p with a flourish above it e and n smaller
734077 that is very helpful mr holmes no doubt you are right wonderful wonderful do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory
734078 i seem to have read that a sawed off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of america apart from the name upon the barrel the idea had occurred to me there is some evidence then that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an american
734079 i have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all
734080 the open window the blood on the sill the queer card the marks of boots in the corner the gun
734081 nothing there that could not have been arranged mr doug las was an american or had lived long in america so had mr barker you dont need to import an american from outside in order to account for american doings
734082 ten years with sir charles chandos as solid as a rock he has been with douglas ever since he took the manor house five years ago he has never seen a gun of this sort in the house
734083 the gun was made to conceal thats why the barrels were sawed it would fit into any box how could he swear there was no such gun in the house
734084 im not con vinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house
734085 im asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside oh man its just incon ceivable its clean against common sense i put it to you mr holmes judging it by what we have heard
734086 the man is not a burglar supposing that he ever existed the ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason very good here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder he knows if he knows anything that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape as the house is surrounded with water what weapon would he choose you would say the most silent in the world then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window to wade the moat and to get away at his leisure thats understandable but is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat is that credible mr holmes
734087 it certainly needs a good deal of justification may i ask mr white mason whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water
734088 there were no signs mr holmes but it is a stone ledge and one could hardly expect them
734089 ha would there be any objection mr white mason to our going down to the house at once there may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive
734090 i was going to propose it mr holmes but i thought it well
734091 i go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police if i have ever separated myself from the official force it is because they have first separated themselves from me i have no wish ever to score at their expense at the same time mr white mason i claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time complete rather than in stages
734092 i am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know
734093 come along dr watson and when the time comes well all hope for a place in your book
734094 that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge its open just as it was found last night
734095 well it wasnt a fat man anyhow we dont need your deductions mr holmes to tell us that but you or i could squeeze through all right
734096 there is nothing there no sign that anyone has landed but why should he leave any sign
734097 generally about this colour the stream brings down the clay
734098 about two feet at each side and three in the middle
734099 so we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing
734100 then you can go home youve had enough we can send for you if we want you the butler had better wait outside tell him to warn mr cecil barker mrs douglas and the house keeper that we may want a word with them presently now gentlemen perhaps you will allow me to give you the views i have formed first and then you will be able to arrive at your own
734101 is it suicide or is it murder thats our first question gentle
734102 so i think suicide is out of the question then a murder has been done what we have to determine is whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house
734103 there are considerable difficulties both ways and yet one or the other it must be we will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime they got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep they then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened a weapon that was never seen in the house before that does not seem a very likely start does it
734104 well then everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household not mr cecil barker alone though he claims to have been the first but ames and all of them were on the spot do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner open the window mark the sill with blood take the wedding nng off the dead mans finger and all the rest of it its impossible
734105 well then we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside we are still faced with some big difficulties but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities the man got into the house between four thirty and six that is to say between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised there had been some visitors and the door was open so there was nothing to prevent him he may have been a common burglar or he may have had some private grudge against mr douglas since mr douglas has spent most of his life in amer ica and this shotgun seems to be an american weapon it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory he slipped into this room because it was the first he came to and he hid behind the curtain there he remained until past eleven at night at that time mr douglas entered the room it was a short interview if there were any interview at all for mrs douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot
734106 exactly the candle which was a new one is not burned more than half an inch he must have placed it on the table before he was attacked otherwise of course it would have fallen when he fell this shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room when mr barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out
734107 well now we can reconstruct things on those lines mr douglas enters the room he puts down the candle a man appears from behind the curtain he is armed with this gun he demands the wedding ring heaven only knows why but so it must have been mr douglas gave it up then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat he shot douglas in this horrible way he dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer card v v 341 whatever that may mean and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when cecil barker was discovering the crime hows that mr holmes
734108 man it would be absolute nonsense if it wasnt that anything else is even worse
734109 somebody killed the man and whoever it was i could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way what does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that what does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape come mr holmes its up to you to give us a lead since you say mr white masons theory is unconvincing
734110 i should like a few more facts before i get so far as a theory mr mac
734111 dear me these injuries are really appalling can we have the butler in for a moment ames i understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark a branded triangle inside a circle upon mr douglass forearm
734112 you never heard any speculation as to what it meant
734113 it must have caused great pain when it was inflicted it is undoubtedly a burn now i observe ames that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of mr douglass jaw did you observe that in life
734114 did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before
734115 it may of course be a mere coincidence or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger had you no ticed anything unusual in his conduct yesterday ames
734116 it struck me that he was a little restless and excited sir
734117 ha the attack may not have been entirely unexpected we do seem to make a little progress do we not perhaps you would rather do the questioning mr mac
734118 well then we will pass to this card v v 341 it is rough cardboard have you any of the sort in the house
734119 this is black ink and the other purplish it was done by a thick pen and these are fine no it was done elsewhere i should say can you make anything of the inscrip tion ames
734120 it gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort the same with his badge upon the forearm
734121 well we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear an agent from such a society makes his way into the house waits for mr douglas blows his head nearly off with this weapon and escapes by wading the moat after leaving a card beside the dead man which will when mentioned in the papers tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done that all hangs together but why this gun of all weapons
734122 and why no arrest its past two now i take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger
734123 well unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready they can hardly miss him and yet they have missed him up to now
734124 it is clearly the tread of a shoe it is remarkably broad a splay foot one would say curious because so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud stained corner one would say it was a more shapely sole however they are certainly very indistinct whats this under the side table
734125 i dont know mr holmes there may have been only one i have not noticed them for months
734126 no such luck but theyve found his bicycle the fellow left his bicycle behind him come and have a look it is within a hundred yards of the hall door
734127 if these things were numbered and registered but we must be thankful for what weve got if we cant find where he went to at least we are likely to get where he came from but what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind and how in the world has he got away without it we dont seem to get a gleam of light in the case mr holmes
734128 then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house we could use the dining room ames please come yourself first and tell us what you know
734129 poor jack is dead you can do nothing for gods sake go back
734130 have you ever heard where his first wife came from
734131 no i remember his saying that she was of german extrac tion and i have seen her portrait she was a very beautiful woman she died of typhoid the year before i met him
734132 you dont associate his past with any particular part of america
734133 i have heard him talk of chicago he knew that city well and had worked there i have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts he had travelled a good deal in his time
734134 was he a politician had this secret society to do with politics
734135 on the contrary i never met a straighter man in my life
734136 he liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains he would never go where other men were if he could help it thats why i first thought that someone was after him then when he left so suddenly for europe i made sure that it was so i believe that he had a warning of some sort within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him
734137 well they were a mighty hard looking crowd they came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was i told them that he was gone to europe and that i did not know where to find him they meant him no good it was easy to see that
734138 well i dont know about californians they were ameri cans all right but they were not miners i dont know what they were and was very glad to see their backs
734139 and then you were together five years in california so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least
734140 it must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that it would be no light thing that would give rise to it
734141 i think it shadowed his whole life it was never quite out of his mind
734142 but if a man had a danger hanging over him and knew what it was dont you think he would turn to the police for protection
734143 maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against theres one thing you should know he always went about armed his revolver was never out of his pocket but by bad luck he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night once the bridge was up i guess he thought he was safe
734144 it is quite six years since douglas left california you followed him next year did you not
734145 and he had been married five years you must have returned about the time of his marriage
734146 no i did not i had been away from england for ten years
734147 but you have seen a good deal of her since
734148 i imagine nothing mr barker i am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case but i mean no offense
734149 its only the facts that we want it is in your interest and everyones interest that they should be cleared up did mr douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife
734150 what has this to do with the matter you are investigating
734151 you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal
734152 well i guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all and i have no right to stand in the way of it id only ask you not to worry mrs douglas over this matter for she has enough upon her just now i may tell you that poor douglas had just one fault in the world and that was his jealousy he was fond of me no man could be fonder of a friend and he was devoted to his wife he loved me to come here and was forever sending for me and yet if his wife and i talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment more than once ive sworn off coming for that reason and then he would write me such penitent imploring letters that i just had to but you can take it from me gentlemen if it was my last word that no man ever had a more loving faithful wife and i can say also no friend could be more loyal than i
734153 that the dead mans wedding ring has been taken from his finger
734154 what do you mean by appears you know it as a fact
734155 when i said appears i meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring
734156 the mere fact that the ring should be absent whoever may have removed it would suggest to anyones mind would it not that the marriage and the tragedy were connected
734157 but if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this ladys honour
734158 i dont know that ive anything else to ask you at present
734159 when you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table was there not
734160 by its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred
734161 and yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted that seems very remarkable
734162 the candle threw a very bad light my first thought was to get a better one the lamp was on the table so i lit it
734163 it is my desire that every possible effort should be made
734164 perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter
734165 i fear not but all i know is at your service
734166 we have heard from mr cecil barker that you did not actually see that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred
734167 no he turned me back upon the stairs he begged me to return to my room
734168 quite so you had heard the shot and you had at once come down
734169 i put on my dressing gown and then came down
734170 how long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by mr barker
734171 it may have been a couple of minutes it is so hard to reckon time at such a moment he implored me not to go on he assured me that i could do nothing then mrs allen the housekeeper led me upstairs again it was all like some dreadful dream
734172 can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot
734173 no i cannot say he went from his dressing room and i did not hear him go he did the round of the house every night for he was nervous of fire it is the only thing that i have ever known him nervous of
734174 that is just the point which i want to come to mrs doug las you have known your husband only in england have you not
734175 have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in america and might bring some danger upon him
734176 i have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him he refused to discuss it with me it was not from want of confidence in me there was the most complete love and confidence betwecn us but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me he thought i should brood over it if i knew all and so he was silent
734177 can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it i knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his american life i knew it by certain precau tions he took i knew it by certain words he let fall i knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers i was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies that he believed they were on his track and that he was always on his guard against them i was so sure of it that for years i have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected
734178 that was an expression he has used when i questioned him i have been in the valley of fear i am not out of it yet are we never to get out of the valley of fear i have asked him when i have seen him more serious than usual sometimes i think that we never shall he has answered
734179 surely you asked him what he meant by the valley of fear
734180 i did but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head it is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow he said please god it shall never fall upon you it was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him of that i am certain but i can tell you no more
734181 yes he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago then i remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips he spoke it with anger and a sort of horror mcginty was the name bodymaster mcginty i asked him when he recovered who bodymaster mcginty was and whose body he was master of never of mine thank god he answered with a laugh and that was all i could get from him but there is a connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear
734182 you met mr douglas in a boarding house in london did you not and became engaged to him there was there any romance anything secret or mysterious about the wedding
734183 there was romance there is always romance there was nothing mysterious
734184 you have heard no doubt that his wedding ring has been taken does that suggest anything to you suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime what possible reason could he have for taking his wed ding ring
734185 well we will not detain you any longer and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time
734186 there are some other points no doubt but we can refer to you as they arise
734187 this man barker has certainly been down here a good deal he is a man who might be attractive to a woman he admits that the dead man was jealous and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy then theres that wedding ring you cant get past that the man who tears a wedding ring off a dead mans what do you say to it mr holmes
734188 can you remember ames what mr barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study
734189 yes mr holmes he had a pair of bedroom slippers i brought him his boots when he went for the police
734190 very good ames it is of course important for us to know which tracks may be mr barkers and which from outside
734191 yes sir i may say that i noticed that the slippers were stained with blood so indeed were my own
734192 that is natural enough considering the condition of the room very good ames we will ring if we want you
734193 theres not a doubt of it barker has just marked the window himself its a good deal broader than any bootmark i mind that you said it was a splay foot and heres the explanation but whats the game mr holmes whats the game
734194 we thought that it was probably you as your friendship with mr sherlock holmes is so well known would you mind com ing over and speaking to mrs douglas for one instant
734195 i fear that you think me callous and hard hearted
734196 perhaps some day you will do me justice if you only
734197 as he has himself said it is no possible business of his
734198 and so i will beg leave to resume my walk
734199 there is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world and it may make a very great difference to me you know mr holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge is it abso lutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives
734200 is he on his own or is he entirely in with them
734201 i really dont know that i should be justified in discussing such a point
734202 i beg i implore that you will dr watson i assure you that you will be helping us helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point
734203 he is his own master and would act as his own judgment directed at the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice beyond this i can say nothing and i would refer you to mr holmes himself if you wanted fuller information
734204 no confidences watson for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspir acy and murder
734205 dear me watson is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb bell well well you need not be downcast for between ourselves i dont think that either inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident one dumb bell watson consider an athlete with one dumb bell picture to yourself the unilateral development the imminent danger of a spinal curvature shocking watson shocking
734206 how do i know that they are lying because it is a clumsy
734207 you may argue but i have too much respect for your
734208 but the gunshot was apparently the cause of death therefore
734209 now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder
734210 it is otherwise however from the housekeepers room it is
734211 if this is so we have now to determine what barker and mrs douglas presuming that they are not the actual murderers could have been doing from quarter to eleven when the sound of the shot brought them down until quarter past eleven when they rang the bell and summoned the servants what were they doing and why did they not instantly give the alarm that is the question which faces us and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem
734212 that there is an under standing between those two people she must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husbands murder
734213 exactly she does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred i am not a whole souled admirer of womankind as you are aware watson but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives having any regard for their husbands who would let any mans spoken word stand between them and that husbands dead body should i ever marry watson i should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her it was badly stage managed for even the rawest investiga tors must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ulula tion if there had been nothing else this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind
734214 you think then definitely that barker and mrs douglas are guilty of the murder
734215 there is an appalling directness about your questions wat son
734216 we will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them it is a large supposition for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way on the contrary there is a good deal of evidence that the douglases were very attached to each other
734217 well at least thcy gave that impression however we will
734218 i see watson you are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false according to your idea there was never any hidden men ace or secret society or valley of fear or boss macsomebody or anything else well that is a good sweeping generalization let us see what that brings us to they invent this theory to account for the crime they then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider the stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea so does the card on the body which might have been prepared in the house that all fits into your hypothesis watson but now we come on the nasty angular uncompromising bits which wont slip into their places why a cut off shotgun of all weapons and an american one at that how could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them its a mere chance as it is that mrs allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door why did your guilty couple do all this watson
734219 then again if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death does that strike you as very probable watson
734220 and once again if the thought of leaving a bicycle con cealed outside had occurred to you would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape
734221 and yet there should be no combination of cvents for which
734222 we will suppose that there was a guilty secret a really
734223 before this avenger got away barker and the wife had reached the room the assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal they were converted to this idea and preferred to let him go for this purpose they probably lowered the bridge which can be done quite noiselessly and then raised it again he made his escape and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle he therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away so far we are within the bounds of possibility are we not
734224 we have to remember watson that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary well now to continue our supposititious case the couple not necessarily a guilty couple realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it they rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation the mark was put by barkers bloodstained slipper upon the window sill to suggest how the fugitive got away they obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done but a good half hour after the event
734225 well if there were an outsider he may be traced and taken that would be the most effective of all proofs but if not well the resources of science are far from being exhausted i think that an evening alone in that study would help me much
734226 i propose to go up there presently i have arranged it with the estimable ames who is by no means whole hearted about barker i shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration im a believer in the genius loci you smile friend watson well we shall see by the way you have that big umbrella of yours have you not
734227 certainly but what a wretchcd weapon if there is dan
734228 nothing serious my dear watson or i should certainly ask for your assistance but ill take the umbrella at present i am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from tunbridge wells where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the blcycle
734229 man ill admeet that i had my doubts if there was ever an outsider
734230 but thats all past now weve had the bicycle identified and we have a description of our man so thats a long step on our journey
734231 it sounds to me like the beginning of the end
734232 im sure i congratulate you both with all my heart
734233 well i started from the fact that mr douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before when he had been at tunbridge wells it was at tunbridge wells then that he had become conscious of some danger it was clear therefore that if a nlan had come over with a bicycle it was from tunbridge wells that he might be expected to have come we took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels it was identified at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as belonging to a man named hargrave who had taken a room there two days before this bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings he had registered his name as coming from london but had given no address the valise was london made and the contents were british but the man himself was undoubtedly an american
734234 you have indeed done some solid work while i have been sitting spinning theories with my friend its a lesson in being practical mr mac
734235 that may or may not be but let us hear the end mr mac was there nothing to identify this man
734236 so little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification there were no papers or letters and no marking upon the clothes a cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table he had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle and no more was heard of him until our inquiries
734237 if the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist as it is he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder
734238 so one would imagine still he has been justified of his wisdom up to date at any rate since he has not been taken but his description what of that
734239 here we have it so far as they could give it they dont seem to have taken any very particular stock of him but still the porter the clerk and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points he was a man about five foot nine in height fifty or so years of age his hair slightly grizzled a grayish moustache a curved nose and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding
734240 well bar the expression that might almost be a description of douglas himself
734241 he is just over fifty with grizzled hair and moustache and about the same height did you get anything else
734242 he was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap
734243 it is less than two feet long it could very well have fitted into his valise he could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty
734244 and how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case
734245 when we have got our man and you may be sure that i had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it we shall be better able to judge but even as it stands we have surely gone a long way we know that an american calling himself hargrave came to tunbridge wells two days ago with bicycle and valise in the latter was a sawed off shotgun so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle with his gun concealed in his overcoat no one saw him arrive so far as we can learn but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates and there are many cyclists upon the road presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found and possibly lurked there him self with his eye on the house waiting for mr douglas to come out the shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house but he had intended to use it outside and there it has very obvious advantages as it would be impossible to miss with it and the sound of shots is so common in an english sporting neighbour hood that no particular notice would be taken
734246 well mr douglas did not appear what was he to do next he left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight he found the bridge down and no one about he took his chance intending no doubt to make some excuse if he met anyone he met no one he slipped into the first room that he saw and concealed himself behind the curtain thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he knew that his only escape was through the moat he waited until quarter past eleven when mr douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room he shot him and escaped as arranged he was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him so he left it there and made his way by some other means to london or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged how is that mr holmes
734247 well mr mac it is very good and very clear so far as it goes that is your end of the story my end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported that mrs douglas and barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something that they aided the murderers escape or at least that they reached the room before he escaped and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge thats my reading of the first half
734248 well mr holmes if this is true we only tumble out of one mystery into another
734249 the lady has never been in america in all her life what possible connection could she have with an american assassin which would cause her to shelter him
734250 i propose to make a little investigation of my own to night and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause
734251 no no darkness and dr watsons umbrella my wants are simple and ames the faithful ames no doubt he will stretch a point for me all my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb bell
734252 would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic a man with softening of the brain an idiot whose mind has lost its grip
734253 he is at present reported from leicester nottingham south ampton derby east ham richmond and fourteen other places in three of them east ham leicester and liverpool there is a clear case against him and he has actually been arrested the country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats
734254 now mr mac and you mr white mason i wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice when i went into this case with you i bargained as you will no doubt remember that i should not present you with half proved theories but that i should retain and work out my own ideas until i had satisfied myself that they were correct for this reason i am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind on the other hand i said that i would play the game fairly by you and i do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task therefore i am here to advise you this morning and my advice to you is summed up in three words abandon the case
734255 i consider your case to be hopeless i do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth
734256 but this cyclist he is not an invention we have his descrip tion his valise his bicycle the fellow must be somewhere why should we not get him
734257 yes yes no doubt he is somewhere and no doubt we shall get him but i would not have you waste your energies in east ham or liverpool i am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result
734258 you are holding something back its hardly fair of you mr holmes
734259 you know my methods of work mr mac but i will hold it back for the shortest time possible i only wish to verify my details in one way which can very readily be done and then i make my bow and return to london leaving my results entirely at your service i owe you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience i cannot recall any more singular and interesting study
734260 this is clean beyond me mr holmes we saw you when we returned from tunbndge wells last night and you were in general agreement with our results what has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case
734261 well since you ask me i spent as i told you that i would some hours last night at the manor house
734262 ah i can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment by the way i have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist
734263 it immensely adds to the zest of an investigation my dear
734264 tut tut mr mac the first sign of temper i have detected in you well i wont read it verbatim since you feel so strongly upon the subject but when i tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644 of the concealment of charles for several days in the course of the civil war and finally of a visit there by the second george you will admit that there are various associations of interest con nected with this ancient house
734265 i dont doubt it mr holmes but that is no business of ours
734266 is it not is it not breadth of view my dear mr mac is one of the essentials of our profession the interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest you will excuse these remarks from one who though a mere connoisseur of crime is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself
734267 you get to your point i admit but you have such a deuced round the corner way of doing it
734268 well well ill drop past history and get down to present day facts i called last night as i have already said at the manor house i did not see either barker or mrs douglas i saw no necessity to disturb them but i was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner my visit was specially made to the good mr ames with whom i exchanged some amiabilities which culmi nated in his allowing me without reference to anyone else to sit alone for a time in the study
734269 no no everything is now in order you gave permission for that mr mac as i am informed the room was in its normal state and in it i passed an instructive quarter of an hour
734270 well not to make a mystery of so simple a matter i was looking for the missing dumb bell it has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case i ended by finding it
734271 ah there we come to the edge of the unexplored let me go a little further a very little further and i will promise that you shall share everything that i know
734272 well were bound to take you on your own terms
734273 but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case
734274 for the simple reason my dear mr mac that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating
734275 we are investigating the murder of mr john douglas of birlstone manor
734276 yes yes so you are but dont trouble to trace the mysteri ous gentleman upon the bicycle i assure you that it wont help you
734277 i will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it
734278 well im bound to say ive always found you had reason behind all your queer ways ill do what you advise
734279 well if it is good enough for the inspector it is good enough for me
734280 do what you like and go where you will but meet me here before dusk without fail without fail mr mac
734281 all of it was excellent advice but i dont insist so long as you are here when i need you but now before we part i want you to write a note to mr barker
734282 it has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat in
734283 tut tut my dear sir please do what i ask you
734284 in the hope that we may find something which may bear
734285 diverting the stream so i thought it best to explain matters beforehand now sign that and send it by hand about four oclock at that hour we shall meet again in this room until then we may each do what we like for i can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause
734286 i am asking you now to put everything to the test with me and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations i have made jus tify the conclusions to which i have come it is a chill evening and i do not know how long our expedition may last so i beg that you will wear your warmest coats it is of the first impor tance that we should be in our places before it grows dark so with your permission we shall get started at once
734287 possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible
734288 what are we here for at all i really think that you might treat us with more frankness
734289 watson insists that i am the dramatist in real life
734290 some touch of the artist wells up within me and calls insistently for a well staged performance surely our profession mr mac would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results the blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulder what can one make of such a denouement but the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of coming events the triumphant vindi cation of bold theories are these not the pride and the justifica tion of our lifes work at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt where would be that thrill if i had been as definite as a timetable i only ask a little patience mr mac and all will be clear to you
734291 well i hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold
734292 i have no more notion than you how long it is to last
734293 if criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains it would certainly be more convenient for all of us as to what it is we well thats what we are watching for
734294 this is what we are after mr barker this bundle weighted with a dumb bell which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat
734295 how in thunder came you to know anything about it
734296 it was of the first importance however that we should be able to prove who placed it there this we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to morrow which had of course the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so we have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportu nity and so mr barker i think the word lies now with you
734297 save only the overcoat which is full of suggestive touches
734298 here as you perceive is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece the tailors tab is on the neck neal outfitter vermissa u s a i have spent an instructive afternoon in the rectors library and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the united states i have some recollection mr barker that you associated the coal districts with mr douglass first wife and it would surely not be too far fetched an inference that the v v upon the card by the dead body might stand for vermissa valley or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that valley of fear of which we have heard so much is fairly clear and now mr barker i seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation
734299 you know such a lot mr holmes perhaps you had better tell us some more
734300 i have no doubt that i could tell you a great deal more mr barker but it would come with a better grace from you
734301 oh you think so do you well all i can say is that if theres any secret here it is not my secret and i am not the man to give it away
734302 we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you
734303 what ever comes of it in the future you have done enough
734304 i have every sympathy with you madam and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence it may be that i am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend dr watson but at that time i had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime now i am assured that this is not so at the same time there is much that is unexplained and i should strongly recommend that you ask mr douglas to tell us his own story
734305 you are the historian of this bunch well dr wat son youve never had such a story as that pass through your hands before and ill lay my last dollar on that tell it your own way but there are the facts and you cant miss the public so long as you have those ive been cooped up two days and ive spent the daylight hours as much daylight as i could get in that rat trap in putting the thing into words youre welcome to them you and your public theres the story of the valley of fear
734306 what we desire now is to hear your story of the present
734307 may i smoke as i talk well thank you mr holmes youre a smoker yourself if i remember right and youll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away
734308 ive heard of you mr holmes i never guessed that i should meet you but before you are through with that
734309 if you are mr john douglas of birlstone manor then whose death have we been investigating for these two days and where in the world have you sprung from now you seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack in a box
734310 you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of king charles people did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places and the hiding place that has once been used may be again i had persuaded myself that we should find mr douglas under this roof
734311 and how long have you been playing this trick upon us mr holmes
734312 how long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one
734313 not one instant my dear mr mac only last night did i form my views of the case as they could not be put to the proof until this evening i invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day pray what more could i do when i found the suit of clothes in the moat it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of mr john douglas at all but must be that of the bicyclist from tunbridge wells no other conclusion was possible therefore i had to determine where mr john douglas himself could be and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape
734314 i thought id dodge your british law for i was not sure
734315 im not going to begin at the beginning thats all there
734316 i never explained to my wife how things were why should i pull her into it she would never have a quiet moment again but would always be imagining trouble i fancy she knew something for i may have dropped a word here or a word there but until yesterday after you gentlemen had seen her she never knew the rights of the matter she told you all she knew and so did barker here for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations she knows everything now and i would have been a wiser man if i had told her sooner but it was a hard question dear
734317 well gentlemen the day before these happenings i was over
734318 i was on my guard all that next day and never went out into
734319 id just the one candle that was in my hand but there was a
734320 he never lost his grip but he got it butt downward for a
734321 i was hanging on the side of the table when barker came
734322 it was at that instant that the idea came to me i was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it the mans sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm see here
734323 it was the sight of that which started me on it i seemed to
734324 my rings were put on his finger but when it came to the wedding ring
734325 well that was the situation if i could lie low for a while
734326 i guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did he opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped it was a tall order that but as the bridge was up there was no other way then when everything was fixed he rang the bell for all he was worth what happened afterward you know and so gentlemen you can do what you please but ive told you the truth and the whole truth so help me god what i ask you now is how do i stand by the english law
734327 the english law is in the main a just law you will get no worse than your deserts from that mr douglas but i would ask you how did this man know that you lived here or how to get into your house or where to hide to get you
734328 you may find worse dangers than the english law or even than your enemies from america i see trouble before you mr douglas youll take my advice and still be on your guard
734329 we need them sometimes in the place i come from
734330 why i thought the country was full of it youll hear quick enough what made you come here
734331 i heard there was always work for a willing man
734332 then youll get your job i guess have you any friends
734333 not yet but i have the means of making them
734334 i am one of the eminent order of freemen theres no town without a lodge and where there is a lodge ill find my friends
734335 thats good enough im brother scanlan lodge 341 vermissa valley glad to see you in these parts
734336 thank you im brother john mcmurdo lodge 29 chi cago bodymaster j h scott but i am in luck to meet a brother so early
734337 well there are plenty of us about you wont find the order more flourishing anywhere in the states than right here in vermissa valley but we could do with some lads like you i cant understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in chicago
734338 ive my own good reasons for leaving chicago and let that be enough for you who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things
734339 all right mate no offense meant the boys will think none the worse of you whatever you may have done where are you bound for now
734340 thats the third halt down the line where are you staying
734341 here is the address jacob shafter sheridan street its a boarding house that was recommended by a man i knew in chicago
734342 well i dont know it but vermissa is out of my beat i live at hobsons patch and thats here where we are drawing up but say theres one bit of advice ill give you before we part if youre in trouble in vermissa go straight to the union house and see boss mcginty he is the bodymaster of vermissa lodge and nothing can happen in these parts unless black jack mcginty wants it so long mate maybe well meet in lodge one of these evenings but mind my words if you are in trouble go to boss mcginty
734343 i allow that hell must be something like that if there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name its more than id expect i guess you are new to this part young man
734344 just this mister that i should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends i dont think id begin with mike scanlan or his gang if i were you
734345 what the hell is it to you who are my friends
734346 did i ask you for your advice or did you think me such a sucker that i couldnt move without it you speak when you are spoken to and by the lord youd have to wait a long time if it was me
734347 it was a warning for your own good seeing that you are by your own showing new to the place
734348 im new to the place but im not new to you and your kind
734349 i guess youre the same in all places shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it
734350 youre a real hand picked one if i am a judge
734351 im not afraid of you and dont you think it
734352 my names jack mcmurdo see if you want me youll find me at jacob shafters on sheridan street vermissa so im not hiding from you am l day or night i dare to look the like of you in the face dont make any mistake about that

734354 it was grand to hear you let me carry your grip and show you the road im passing shafters on the way to my own shack
734355 how could i have heard of him when you know that i am a stranger in these parts
734356 well i thought his name was known clear across the coun try its been in the papers often enough
734357 good lord mister you are queer if i must say it without offense theres only one set of affairs that youll hear of in these parts and thats the affairs of the scowrers
734358 why i seem to have read of the scowrers in chicago a gang of murderers are they not
734359 man you wont live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less
734360 well i know nothing about them its only what i have read
734361 and im not saying that you have not read the truth
734362 if killing is murder then god knows there is murder and to spare but dont you dare to breathe the name of jack mcginty in connection with it stranger for every whisper goes back to him and he is not one that is likely to let it pass now thats the house youre after that one standing back from the street youll find old jacob shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township
734363 did you come to see him he is down town i expect him back every minute
734364 im in no hurry to see him but your house was recommended to me for board i thought it might suit me and now i know it will
734365 im miss ettie shafter mr shafters daughter my moth ers dead and i run the house you can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along ah here he is so you can fix things with him right away
734366 well the worse luck for someone else let him look out for himself am i to lose my lifes chance and all my hearts desire for someone else you can keep on saying no ettie the day will come when you will say yes and im young enough to wait
734367 i remembered your address so l made bold to call im surprised that youve not reported to the bodymaster why havent you seen boss mcginty yet
734368 well i had to find a job i have been busy
734369 you must find time for him if you have none for anything else good lord man youre a fool not to have been down to the union house and registered your name the first morning after you came here if you run against him well you mustnt thats all
734370 ive been a member of the lodge for over two years scanlan but i never heard that duties were so pressing as all that
734371 youll tell me that in a months time i hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after i left the train
734372 oh it got about things do get about for good and for bad in this district
734373 well yes i told the hounds what i thought of them
734374 by the lord youll be a man after mcgintys heart
734375 its not the police but you that hell hate if you dont now take a friends advice and go at once
734376 that you are gettin set on my ettie aint that so or am i wrong
734377 vell i vant to tell you right now that it aint no manner of use theres someone slipped in afore you
734378 vell you can lay that she told you truth but did she tell you who it vas
734379 i dare say not the leetle baggage perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay
734380 ah yes my friend you need not be ashamed to be fright ened of him it is teddy baldwin
734381 scowrers ive heard of them before its scowrers here and scowrers there and always in a whisper what are you all afraid of who are the scowrers
734382 you i vould never have had you in my house if i had known it not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek
734383 whats wrong with the order its for charity and good fellowship the rules say so
734384 prove it are there not fifty murders to prove it vat about milman and van shorst and the nicholson family and old mr hyam and little billy james and the others prove it is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it
734385 i want you to take back what youve said or else make it good one or the other you must do before i quit this room put yourself in my place here am i a stranger in the town i belong to a society that i know only as an innocent one youll find it through the length and breadth of the states but always as an innocent one now when i am counting upon joining it here you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the scowrers i guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation mr shafter
734386 i can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows mister the bosses of the one are the bosses of the other if you offend the one it is the other vat vill strike you we have proved it too often
734387 if you live here long you vill get your proof but i forget that you are yourself one of them you vill soon be as bad as the rest but you vill find other lodgings mister i cannot have you here is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my ettie and that i dare not turn him down but that i should have another for my boarder yes indeed you shall not sleep here after to night
734388 its little i would care if it was just my room but indeed ettie though its only a week that ive known you you are the very breath of life to me and i cant live without you
734389 i have told you have i not that you are too late there is another and if i have not promised to marry him at once at least i can promise no one else
734390 suppose i had been first ettie would i have had a chance
734391 will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise follow your heart acushla tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying
734392 say that you will be mine and we will face it out together
734393 it could not be here could you take me away
734394 ill hold you against the world ettie right here where we are
734395 id never hold my head up again if i felt that i had been driven out besides what is there to be afraid of are we not free folks in a free country if you love me and i you who will dare to come between
734396 you dont know jack youve been here too short a time you dont know this baldwin you dont know mcginty and his scowrers
734397 no i dont know them and i dont fear them and i dont believe in them
734398 ive lived among rough men my darling and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me always ettie its mad on the face of it if these men as your father says have done crime after crime in the valley and if everyone knows them by name how comes it that none are brought to justice you answer me that ettie
734399 because no witness dares to appear against them he would not live a month if he did also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime but surely jack you must have read all this i had understood that every paper in the united states was writing about it
734400 well i have read something it is true but i had thought it was a story maybe these men have some reason in what they do maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves
734401 oh jack dont let me hear you speak so that is how he speaks the other one
734402 and that is why i loathe him so oh jack now i can tell you the truth i loathe him with all my heart but i fear him also i fear him for myself but above all i fear him for father i know that some great sorrow would come upon us if i dared to say what i really felt that is why i have put him off with half promises it was in real truth our only hope but if you would fly with me jack we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men
734403 no harm shall come to you ettie nor to your father either as to wicked men i expect you may find that i am as bad as the worst of them before were through
734404 good lord how little you know of me your innocent soul my darling could not even guess what is passing in mine but hullo whos the visitor
734405 youre earlier than i had thought come and sit down
734406 its a friend of mine mr baldwin a new boarder here mr
734407 maybe miss ettie has told you how it is with us
734408 i didnt understand that there was any relation between you
734409 didnt you well you can understand it now you can take it from me that this young lady is mine and youll find it a very fine evening for a walk
734410 thank you i am in no humour for a walk
734411 maybe you are in a humour for a fight mr boarder
734412 oh ted be reasonable be kind for my sake ted if ever you loved me be big hearted and forgiving
734413 i think ettie that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled
734414 or maybe mr baldwin you will take a turn down the street with me its a fine evening and theres some open ground beyond the next block
734415 ill get even with you without needing to dirty my hands
734416 youll wish you had never set foot in this house before i am through with you
734417 ill choose my own time mister you can leave the time to me see here
734418 well you will know ill promise you that you wont be much older either perhaps miss ettie can tell you something about it as to you ettie youll come back to me on your knees dye hear girl on your knees and then ill tell you what your punishment may be youve sowed and by the lord ill see that you reap
734419 oh jack how brave you were but it is no use you must fly to night jack to night its your only hope he will have your life i read it in his horrible eyes what chance have you against a dozen of them with boss mcginty and all the power of the lodge behind them
734420 there acushla there dont be disturbed or fear for me im a freeman myself im after telling your father about it maybe i am no better than the others so dont make a saint of me perhaps you hate me too now that ive told you as much
734421 hate you jack while life lasts i could never do that ive heard that there is no harm in being a freeman anywhere but here so why should i think the worse of you for that but if you are a freeman jack why should you not go down and make a friend of boss mcginty oh hurry jack hurry get your word in first or the hounds will be on your trail
734422 ill go right now and fix it you can tell your father that ill sleep here to night and find some other quarters in the morning
734423 well young man i cant call your face to mind
734424 you are not so new that you cant give a gentleman his proper title
734425 im sorry councillor im strange to the ways of the place but i was advised to see you
734426 well you see me this is all there is what dyou think of me
734427 well its early days if your heart is as big as your body and your soul as fine as your face then id ask for nothing better
734428 by gar youve got an irish tongue in your head anyhow
734429 brother scanlan of lodge 341 vermissa i drink your health councillor and to our better acquaintance
734430 a bit closer mr mcmurdo for we dont take folk on trust in these parts nor believe all were told neither come in here for a moment behind the bar
734431 if i thought you were playing any game on us it would be short work for you
734432 for the bodymaster of a lodge of freemen to give to a stranger brother
734433 ay but its just that same that you have to prove
734434 and god help you if you fail where were you made
734435 hum you seem glib enough in your tests what are you doing here
734436 i have had that name among those that knew me best
734437 well we may try you sooner than you think have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts
734438 ive heard that it takes a man to be a brother
734439 true for you mr mcmurdo why did you leave chicago
734440 see here mister you cant expect me as bodymaster to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he cant answer
734441 ill wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me
734442 i should apologize i spoke without thought well i know that i am safe in your hands look at that clipping
734443 i was helping uncle sam to make dollars maybe mine were
734444 well it means to pass the dollars out into circulation then he said he would split maybe he did split i didnt wait to see i just killed him and lighted out for the coal country
734445 cause id read in the papers that they werent too particular in those parts
734446 you were first a coiner and then a mur derer and you came to these parts because you thought youd be welcome
734447 well i guess youll go far say can you make those dollars yet
734448 i can see no difference gar youll be a mighty useful brother im thinking we can do with a bad man or two among us friend mcmurdo for there are times when we have to take our own part wed soon be against the wall if we didnt shove back at those that were pushing us
734449 well i guess ill do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys
734450 you seem to have a good nerve you didnt squirm when i shoved this gun at you
734451 i was covering you all the time i guess my shot would have been as quick as yours
734452 say weve had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year i reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you well what the hell do you want and cant i speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us
734453 im sorry councillor but its ted baldwin he says he must see you this very minute
734454 you got here first did you ive a word to say to you councillor about this man
734455 ill say it at my own time in my own way
734456 this will never do we have a new brother here baldwin and its not for us to greet him in such fashion hold out your hand man and make it up
734457 ive offered to fight him if he thinks i have wronged him
734458 ill fight him with fists or if that wont satisfy him ill fight him any other way he chooses now ill leave it to you councillor to judge between us as a bodymaster should
734459 as between two brothers of the lodge i should say that she was
734460 you would throw over one that has stood by you this five
734461 youve been asking for it this many a day ted baldwin now youve got it
734462 maybe you think if i was voted down from bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes its for the lodge to say that but so long as i am the chief ill have no man lift his voice agalnst me or my rulings
734463 we are all good friends again and theres an end of the matter
734464 let us drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge after that as you know there can be no bad blood between us now then the left hand on the apple of my throat i say to you ted baldwin what is the offense sir
734465 thats the end of the black blood you come under lodge discipline if it goes further and thats a heavy hand in these parts as brother baldwin knows and as you will damn soon find out brother mcmurdo if you ask for trouble
734466 im quick to quarrel and quick to forgive its my hot irish blood they tell me but its over for me and i bear no grudge
734467 to think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys its the devils own luck well its the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for its outside the jurisdiction of a bodymaster and the lord be praised for that we have enough on us without the women as well youll have to be affiliated to lodge 341 brother mcmurdo we have our own ways and methods different from chicago saturday night is our meeting and if you come then well make you free forever of the vermissa valley
734468 thats so were looking to you councillor and to the other leading citizens to help us in upholding law and order in this township captain marvin is my name
734469 for we have our own police of the township and no need for any imported goods what are you but the paid tool of the capitalists hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen
734470 i expect we all do our duty same as we see it but we cant all see it the same
734471 i was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life
734472 youre jack mcmurdo of chicago right enough and dont you deny it
734473 no no jack bluster wont do with me i was an officer in chicago before ever i came to this darned coal bunker and i know a chicago crook when i see one
734474 dont tell me that youre marvin of the chicago central
734475 just the same old teddy marvin at your service we havent forgotten the shooting of jonas pinto up there
734476 did you not thats good impartial evidence aint it well his death came in uncommon handy for you or they would have had you for shoving the queer well we can let that be bygones for between you and me and perhaps im going further than my duty in saying it they could get no clear case against you and chicagos open to you to morrow
734477 well ive given you the pointer and youre a sulky dog not to thank me for it
734478 well i suppose you mean well and i do thank you
734479 its mum with me so long as i see you living on the straight
734480 but by the lord if you get off after this its another story so good night to you and good night councillor
734481 the bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed blinded and entered
734482 are you already a member of the ancient order of freemen
734483 we know brother by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us
734484 we would have you know however that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites and also certain duties of our own which call for good men are you ready to be tested
734485 you have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death
734486 and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances
734487 then in the name of lodge 341 vemmissa i welcome you to its privileges and debates you will put the liquor on the table brother scanlan and we will drink to our worthy brother
734488 there is a job to be done on andrew rae of rae amp
734489 windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two and it is not for us to refuse him
734490 youll do tiger cormac if you handle it as well as you did the last you wont be wrong and you wilson
734491 its your first is it not well you have to be blooded some time it will be a great start for you as to the pistol youll find it waiting for you or im mistaken if you report yourselves on monday it will be time enough youll get a great welcome when you return
734492 never mind the reward you just do it for the honour of the thing maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box
734493 sure its not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done he has been judged over there thats no business of ours all we have to do is to carry it out for them same as they would for us speaking of that two brothers from the merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter
734494 faith it is wiser not to ask if you know nothing you can testify nothing and no trouble can come of it but they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it
734495 folk are gettin out of hand in these parts it was only last week that three of our men were turned off by foreman blaker its been owing him a long time and hell get it full and proper
734496 tis our new brother sir who finds our ways to his taste
734497 i would say eminent bodymaster that if a man should be wanted i should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge
734498 that brother mcmurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him
734499 sure that was what i meant im in your hands
734500 we have marked you down as a willing man and we believe that you will do good work in these parts there is a small matter to night in which you may take a hand if it so please you
734501 you can come to night anyhow and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community i will make the announcement later meanwhile
734502 i have one or two more points to bring before the meeting first of all i will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance there is the pension to jim carnaways widow he was struck down doing the work of the lodge and it is for us to see that she is not the loser
734503 jim was shot last month when they tried to kill chester wilcox of marley creek
734504 the firms have been generous of late max linder amp co paid five hundred to be left alone walker brothers sent in a hundred but i took it on myself to return it and ask for five if i do not hear by wednesday their winding gear may get out of order we had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable then the west section coaling company has paid its annual contribution we have enough on hand to meet any obligations
734505 he has sold out and left the district the old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in new york than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers by gar it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us i guess he wont show his face in this valley again
734506 may i ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district
734507 yes brother morris it has been bought by the state amp merton county railroad company
734508 and who bought the mines of todman and of lee that came into the market in the same way last year
734509 and who bought the ironworks of manson and of shuman and of van deher and of atwood which have all been given up of late
734510 they were all bought by the west gilmerton general mining company
734511 that it matters to us who buys them since they cant carry them out of the district
734512 with all respect to you eminent bodymaster i think it may matter very much to us this process has been going on now for ten long years we are gradually driving all the small men out of trade what is the result we find in their places great companies like the railroad or the general iron who have their directors in new york or philadelphia and care nothing for our threats we can take it out of their local bosses but it only means that others will be sent in their stead and we are making it dangerous for ourselves the small men could not harm us they had not the money nor the power so long as we did not squeeze them too dry they would stay on under our power but if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court
734513 that we go easier upon the small men on the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken
734514 you were always a croaker so long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the united states that can touch them sure have we not tried it often enough in the law courts i expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight same as the little companies do and now brethren
734515 this lodge has finished its business for the evening save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting the time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony
734516 theres one man in this town that wants trimming up and its for you to see that he gets it im speaking of james stanger of the herald youve seen how hes been opening his mouth against us again
734517 twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassina tions which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst from that day these outrages have never ceased until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of europe is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry flag of freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the east the men are known the organization is patent and public how long are we to endure it can we forever live sure ive read enough of the slush
734518 thats what he says of us the question im asking you is what shall we say to him
734519 i tell you brethren that our hand is too heavy in this valley and that there will come a point where in self defense every man will unite to crush us out james stanger is an old man he is respected in the township and the district his paper stands for all that is solid in the valley if that man is struck down there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction
734520 and how would they bring about our destruction mr standback
734521 is it by the police sure half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us or is it by the law courts and the judge havent we tried that before now and what ever came of it
734522 there is a judge lynch that might try the case
734523 and i could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end
734524 see here brother morris i have my eye on you and have had for some time youve no heart yourself and you try to take the heart out of others it will be an ill day for you brother morris when your own name comes on our agenda paper and im thinking that its just there that i ought to place it
734525 i apologize eminent bodymaster to you and to every brother in this lodge if i have said more than i should i am a faithful member you all know that and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words but i have greater trust in your judgment than in my own eminent bodymaster and i promise you that i will not offend again
734526 very good brother morris its myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson but so long as i am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed and now boys
734527 ill say this much that if stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for these editors hang together and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops but i guess you can give him a pretty severe warning will you fix it brother baldwin
734528 half a dozen and two to guard the door youll come gower and you mansel and you scanlan and the two willabys
734529 thats enough the sooner we get to work the better
734530 you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us arthur willaby can stay with you you others come with me have no fears boys for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the union bar at this very moment
734531 who are you to interfere you that are new to the lodge stand back
734532 ill blow your face in if you lay a hand on me as to the lodge wasnt it the order of the bodymaster that the man was not to be killed and what are you doing but killing him
734533 the windows are all lighting up and youll have the whole town here inside of five minutes
734534 i wanted to have a word with you mr mcmurdo
734535 why did you not put your name to the note
734536 one has to be cautious mister one never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one one never knows either who to trust or who not to trust
734537 what ever we say even what we think seems to go back to that man mcginty
734538 it was only last night as you know well that i swore good faith to our bodymaster would you be asking me to break my oath
734539 i can only say that i am sorry i gave you the trouble to come and meet me things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other
734540 i am a newcomer as you know and i am strange to it all it is not for me to open my mouth mr morris and if you think well to say anything to me i am here to hear it
734541 for myself i am loyal to the lodge and so l tell you straight but i would be a poor creature if i were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence it will go no further than me though i warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy
734542 i have given up looking for either the one or the other
734543 i may be putting my very life in your hands by what i say but bad as you are and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst still you are new to it and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs that was why i thought to speak with you
734544 if you give me away may a curse be on you
734545 i would ask you then when you joined the freemans society in chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime
734546 you have seen little of it if you can call it anything else was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs was that crime or what else would you call it
734547 a war of two classes with all in so that each struck as best it could
734548 well did you think of such a thing when you joined the freemans society at chicago
734549 nor did i when i joined it at philadelphia it was just a benefit club and a meeting place for ones fellows then i heard of this place curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears and i came to better myself my god to better myself my wife and three children came with me i started a drygoods store on market square and i prospered well the word had gone round that i was a freeman and i was forced to join the local lodge same as you did last night ive the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart i found that i was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime what could i do every word i said to make things better was taken as treason same as it was last night i cant get away for all i have in the world is in my store if i leave the society i know well that it means murder to me and god knows what to my wife and children oh man it is awful awful
734550 i had a conscience and a religion but they made me a
734551 it was a lonely house twenty miles from here over the
734552 but i was a criminal then part sharer in a murder lost forever in this world and lost also in the next i am a good catholic but the priest would have no word with me when he heard i was a scowrer and i am excommunicated from my faith thats how it stands with me and t see you going down the same road and i ask you what the end is to be are you ready to be a cold blooded murderer also or can we do anything to stop it
734553 im thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter
734554 too much wait till you have lived here longer look down the valley see the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshad ows it i tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people it is the valley of fear the valley of death the terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn wait young man and you will learn for yourself
734555 well ill let you know what i think when i have seen more
734556 well let it rest at that ill bear what you have said in mind and maybe some day ill come back to it i expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this now ill be getting home
734557 we may have been seen together they may want to know what we have spoken about
734558 and i refuse it thats our business well so long brother morris and may you find things go better with you in the future
734559 i guess i am too busy over the folk that visit me but i thought id stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house
734560 to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge what were you speaking to brother morris about on miller hill this morning
734561 morris didnt know i could earn a living here at home he shant know either for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me but hes a good hearted old chap it was his idea that i was at a loose end and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store
734562 sure couldnt i earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours work
734563 thats so but i wouldnt get about too much with morris
734564 well i guess because i tell you not thats enough for most folk in these parts
734565 it may be enough for most folk but it aint enough for me councillor
734566 if you are a judge of men youll know that
734567 well if you want reasons ill give them did morris say nothing to you against the lodge
734568 well thats because he darent trust you but in his heart he is not a loyal brother we know that well so we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him im thinking that the time is drawing near theres no room for scabby sheep in our pen but if you keep company with a disloyal man we might think that you were disloyal too see
734569 theres no chance of my keeping company with him for i dislike the man
734570 as to being disloyal if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice
734571 i came down to give you a word in season and youve had it
734572 how you ever came to learn that i had spoken with morris at all
734573 its my business to know what goes on in this township
734574 i thought youd be getting into trouble mr crooked mcmurdo of chicago
734575 cant keep out of it can you take your hat and come along with us
734576 who are you id like to know to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest law abiding men
734577 we are not out after you but after this man mcmurdo it is for you to help not to hinder us in our duty
734578 he is a friend of mine and ill answer for his conduct
734579 by all accounts mr mcginty you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days
734580 this man mcmurdo was a crook before ever he came here and hes a crook still cover him patrolman while i disarm him
734581 maybe cap tain marvin if you and i were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily
734582 by gar a man might as well live in russia as in vemmissa while folk like you are running the police its a capitalist outrage and youll hear more of it i reckon
734583 you do what you think is your duty the best way you can councillor well look after ours
734584 of being concerned in the beating of old editor stanger at the herald office it wasnt your fault that it isnt a murder charge
734585 you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now this man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight and i can bring a dozen to prove it
734586 thats your affair and i guess you can settle it in court to morrow meanwhile come on mcmurdo and come quietly if you dont want a gun across your head you stand wide mr mcginty for i warn you i will stand no resistance when i am on duty
734587 ill see reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself take my word for it that they wont be able to hold you
734588 i wouldnt bet on that guard the prisoner you two and shoot him if he tries any games ill search the house before i leave
734589 and to think that you should come to me heart of my heart and i should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you come then darling
734590 why were you so scared of me oh jack if your conscience was at ease you would not have looked at me like that
734591 sure i was thinking of other things and when you came
734592 i know it why else should you hold it from me was it to your wife that you were writing how am i to know that you are not a married man you a stranger that nobody knows
734593 i am not married ettie see now i swear it youre the only one woman on earth to me by the cross of christ i swear it
734594 im under oath not to show it and just as i wouldnt break my word to you so i would keep it to those who hold my promise its the business of the lodge and even to you its secret and if i was scared when a hand fell on me cant you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective
734595 sit here by me then its a queer throne for such a queen but its the best your poor lover can find hell do better for you some of these days im thinking now your mind is easy once again is it not
734596 how can it ever be at ease jack when i know that you are a criminal among criminals when i never know the day that i may hear you are in court for murder mcmurdo the scowrer thats what one of oor boarders called you yesterday it went through my heart like a knife
734597 well dear its not so bad as you think we are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights
734598 give it up jack for my sake for gods sake give it up it was to ask you that i came here to day oh jack see i beg it of you on my bended knees kneeling here before you i implore you to give it up
734599 sure my darlin you dont know what it is you are asking how could i give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades if you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me besides if i wanted to how could i do it you dont suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets
734600 ive thought of that jack ive planned it all father has saved some money he is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives he is ready to go we would fly together to philadelphia or new york where we would be safe from them
734601 the lodge has a long arm do you think it could not stretch from here to philadelphia or new york
734602 well then to the west or to england or to germany where father came from anywhere to get away from this val ley of fear
734603 sure it is the second time i have heard the valley so named
734604 the shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you
734605 it darkens every moment of our lives do you suppose that ted baldwin has ever forgiven us if it were not that he fears you what do you suppose our chances would be if you saw the look in those dark hungry eyes of his when they fall on me
734606 by gar id teach him better manners if i caught him at it but see here little girl i cant leave here i cant take that from me once and for all but if you will leave me to find my own way i will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it
734607 well well its just how you look at it but if youll give me six months ill work it so that i can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face
734608 well it may be seven or eight but within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us
734609 they chose us because neither i nor the boy here drink
734610 they can count on us saying no more than we should you must not take it amiss but it is the orders of the county delegate that we obey
734611 thats true enough and well talk till the cows come home of the killing of charlie williams or of simon bird or any other job in the past but till the work is done we say nothing
734612 there are half a dozen about here that i have a word to say to
734613 i suppose it isnt jack knox of ironhill that you are after id go some way to see him get his deserts
734614 well if you wont tell us we cant make you but id be glad to know
734615 what is it but a war between us and them and we hit back where we best can
734616 ive got a job thats worthy of you at last youll have the doing of it in your own hands
734617 you can take two men with you manders and reilly they have been warned for service well never be right in this district until chester wilcox has been settled and youll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him
734618 ill do my best anyhow who is he and where shall i find him
734619 hes the chief foreman of the iron dike company hes a
734620 what in thunder has that to do with you carnaway was about his house at night and he shot him thats enough for me and you youve got to settle the thing right
734621 theres these two women and the children do they go up too
734622 what sort of fools talk is this do you back out
734623 easy councillor easy what have i ever said or done that you should think i would be after standing back from an order of the bodymaster of my own lodge if its right or if its wrong its for you to decide
734624 well you had best give me a night or two that i may see the
734625 i leave it with you it will be a great day when you bring us the news its just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees
734626 hes my man and ill get him sure if i have to wait a year for him
734627 i cant forget that i spoke my heart to you once and that you kept it to yourself even though the boss himself came to ask you about it
734628 what else could i do if you trusted me it wasnt that i agreed with what you said
734629 i know that well but you are the one that i can speak to and be safe ive a secret here
734630 and it is just burning the life out of me i wish it had come to any one of you but me if i tell it it will mean murder for sure if i dont it may bring the end of us all god help me but i am near out of my wits over it
734631 i can tell it to you all in one sentence
734632 isnt the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us
734633 no no its no man of the district as you say we know them and it is little that they can do but youve heard of pinkertons
734634 well you can take it from me youve no show when they are on your trail its not a take it or miss it government con cern its a dead earnest business proposition thats out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them if a pinkerton man is deep in this business we are all destroyed
734635 ah its the first thought that came to you so it will be up at the lodge didnt i say to you that it would end in murder
734636 sure what is murder isnt it common enough in these parts
734637 it is indeed but its not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered id never rest easy again and yet its our own necks that may be at stake in gods name what shall i do
734638 you wont gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake lets have the facts who is the fellow where is he how did you hear of him why did you come to me
734639 i came to you for you are the one man that would advise me i told you that i had a store in the east before i came here i left good friends behind me and one of them is in the telegraph service heres a letter that i had from him yesterday its this part from the top of the page you can read it yourself
734640 but this man your friend has he any other person that he would be likely to write to
734641 well i dare say he knows one or two more
734642 i was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow birdy edwards then we could get on his trail
734643 well its possible but i should not think he knew him he is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business how would he know this pinkerton man
734644 ive got him what a fool i was not to know it lord but were in luck we will fix him before he can do any harm see here morris will you leave this thing in my hands
734645 ill do that you can stand right back and let me run it even your name need not be mentioned ill take it all on myself as if it were to me that this letter has come will that content you
734646 then leave it at that and keep your head shut now ill get down to the lodge and well soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself
734647 the less you know friend morris the easier your con science will be and the better you will sleep ask no questions and let these things settle themselves i have hold of it now
734648 its him or us i guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley why brother morris well have to elect you bodymaster yet for youve surely saved the lodge
734649 sure it is not very bad my sweetheart and yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse
734650 i promised you once that i would go some day i think the time is coming i had news to night bad news and i see trouble coming
734651 well a pinkerton but sure you wouldnt know what that is acushla nor what it may mean to the likes of me im too deep in this thing and i may have to get out of it quick you said you would come with me if i went
734652 im an honest man in some things ettie i wouldnt hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where i always see you would you trust me
734653 well then listen to what i say and do as i order you for indeed its the only way for us things are going to happen in this valley i feel it in my bones there may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves im one anyhow if i go by day or night its you that must come with me
734654 no no you shall come with me if this valley is closed to me and i can never come back how can i leave you behind and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message its with me you must come i know a good woman in the place i come from and its there id leave you till we can get married will you come
734655 god bless you for your trust in me its a fiend out of hell that i should be if i abused it now mark you ettie it will be just a word to you and when it reaches you you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till i come for you
734656 theres business here that wants a solomon in judg ment to set it right
734657 they both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man crabbe over at stylestown and whos to say which fired the bullet
734658 its a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence now brother we attend you
734659 i am the bearer of ill news this day but it is better that it should be known and discussed than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all i have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction and that at this very moment there is a pinkerton detective one birdy edwards at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us and send every man in this room into a felons cell that is the situation for the discussion of which i have made a claim of urgency
734660 it is in this letter which has come into my hands
734661 it is a matter of honour with me that i can give no further particulars about the letter nor put it into your hands but i assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge i put the case before you as it has reached me
734662 that i have heard of birdy edwards and that he has the name of being the best man in the pinkerton service
734663 i believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands
734664 if we act quickly and wisely we can cut this thing short if i have your confidence and your help it is little that we have to fear
734665 what have we to fear anyhow what can he know of our affairs
734666 you might say so if all were as stanch as you councillor but this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought he will get at our secrets maybe has got them already theres only one sure cure
734667 you and i have had our differences but you have said the true word to night
734668 i would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge god forbid that i should throw a doubt on anyone here but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man there would be an end of any chance of our getting him i would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee mr chairman yourself if i might suggest it and brother baldwin here and five more then i can talk freely of what i know and of what i advise should be done
734669 i need not tell you that he is not here under that name hes a brave man but not a crazy one he passes under the name of steve wilson and he is lodging at hobsons patch
734670 because i fell into talk with him i thought little of it at the
734671 ill tell you he got out at hobsons patch and so did i i
734672 see here said the operator after hed gone out i guess we should charge double rates for this i guess you should said i he had filled the form with stuff that might have been chinese for all we could make of it he fires a sheet of this off every day said the clerk yes said i its special news for his paper and hes scared that the others should tap it that was what the operator thought and what i thought at the time but i think differently now
734673 but what do you allow that we should do about it
734674 id start this next minute if i knew where we could find him
734675 hes in hobsons patch but i dont know the house ive got a plan though if youll only take my advice
734676 ill go to the patch to morrow morning ill find him through the operator he can locate him i guess well then ill tell him that im a freeman myself ill offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price you bet hell tumble to it ill tell him the papers are at my house and that its as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about hell see that thats horse sense let him come at ten oclock at night and he shall see everything that will fetch him sure
734677 you can plan the rest for yourselves widow macnamaras is a lonely house shes as true as steel and as deaf as a post theres only scanlan and me in the house if i get his promise and ill let you know if i do id have the whole seven of you come to me by nine oclock well get him in if ever he gets out alive well he can talk of birdy edwardss luck for the rest of his days
734678 theres going to be a vacancy at pinkertons or im mis taken leave it at that mcmurdo at nine to morrow well be with you you once get the door shut behind him and you can leave the rest with us
734679 hes been here some time six weeks at the least i guess he didnt come into these parts to look at the prospect if he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back i should expect that he has got results and that he has passed them on
734680 true as steel every man of them and yet by the lord there is that skunk morris what about him if any man gives us away it would be he ive a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him
734681 i wont deny that i have a liking for morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm he has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters and though he may not see them the same as you or i he never seemed the sort that squeals but still it is not for me to stand between him and you
734682 but whatever you do must be to morrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair is settled up we cant afford to set the police buzzing to day of all days
734683 and well learn from birdy edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first did he seem to scent a trap
734684 if he could get on a good trail of the scowrers hes ready to follow it into hell i took his money
734685 and as much more when he has seen all my papers
734686 well there are no papers but i filled him up about constitu tions and books of rules and forms of membership he expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves
734687 didnt he ask you why you didnt bring him the papers
734688 as if i would carry such things and me a suspected man and captain marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot
734689 i guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you we could put him down an old shaft when weve done with him but however we work it we cant get past the man living at hobsons patch and you being there to day
734690 if we handle it right they can never prove the killing
734691 no one can see him come to the house after dark and ill lay to it that no one will see him go now see here councillor ill show you my plan and ill ask you to fit the others into it you will all come in good time very well he comes at ten he is to tap three times and me to open the door for him then ill get behind him and shut it hes our man then
734692 yes but the next step wants considering hes a hard propo sition hes heavily armed ive fooled him proper and yet he is likely to be on his guard suppose i show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone there is going to be shooting and somebody is going to be hurt
734693 and the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it
734694 this is how i should work it you will all be in the big room same as you saw when you had a chat with me ill open the door for him show him into the parlour beside the door and leave him there while i get the papers that will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping then i will go back to him with some faked papers as he is reading them i will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm youll hear me call and in you will rush the quicker the better for he is as strong a man as i and i may have more than i can manage but i allow that i can hold him till you come
734695 the lodge will owe you a debt for this i guess when i move out of the chair i can put a name to the man thats coming after me
734696 and if i were you mike scanlan i would take a night off and keep clear of it there will be bloody work here before morning
734697 its not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me when i saw manager dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than i could stand im not made for it same as you or mcginty if the lodge will think none the worse of me ill just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening
734698 if he is strapped to that we will have the truth out of him
734699 not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat its a pity there are no shutters to your windows
734700 sure no one can spy upon us now its close upon the hour
734701 maybe he wont come maybe hell get a sniff of danger
734702 he is as eager to come as you can be to see him hark to that
734703 and you baldwin if you dont take your hand off your pistol youll cheat the hangman yet pull it out or by the lord that made me there that will do there are forty armed men round this house and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have take their pistols marvin
734704 id like to say a word to you before we separate
734705 i guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse ill give you something to think over between now and then you know me now for what i am at last i can put my cards on the table i am birdy edwards of pinkertons i was chosen to break up your gang i had a hard and dangerous game to play not a soul not one soul not my nearest and dearest knew that i was playing it only captain marvin here and my employers knew that but its over to night thank god and i am the winner
734706 maybe you think that the game is not over yet well i take
734707 still i had to carry out my job and i came to the coal
734708 so i joined your infernal lodge and i took my share in your councils maybe they will say that i was as bad as you they can say what they like so long as i get you but what is the truth the night i joined you beat up old man stanger i could not warn him for there was no time but i held your hand baldwin when you would have killed him if ever i have suggested things so as to keep my place among you they were things which i knew i could prevent i could not save dunn and menzies for i did not know enough but i will see that their murderers are hanged i gave chester wilcox warning so that when i blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding there was many a crime that i could not stop but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road or was down in town when you went for him or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out youll see my work
734709 ay john mcginty you may call me that if it eases your
734710 ive nothing more to say to you except that when my time comes ill die the easier when i think of the work i have done in this valley now marvin ill keep you no more take them in and get it over
734711 there are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped there is no safety for your husband in england
734712 its poor douglas they tell me his name is edwards but he will always be jack douglas of benito canon to me i told you that they started together for south africa in the palmyra three weeks ago
734713 the ship reached cape town last night i received this cable
734714 so i think also these infernal scowrers this cursed vindic
734715 there is a master hand here it is no case of sawed off shotguns and clumsy six shooters you can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush i can tell a moriarty when i see one this crime is from london not from america
734716 because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed a great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man it is crushing the nut with the triphammer an absurd extravagance of energy but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same
734717 how came this man to have anything to do with it
734718 i can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants these americans were well advised having an english job to do they took into partnership as any foreign criminal could do this great consul tant in crime from that moment their man was doomed at first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim then he would indicate how the matter might be treated finally when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent he would step in himself with a master touch you heard me warn this man at birlstone manor house that the coming danger was greater than the past was i right
734719 do not tell me that we have to sit down under this do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil
734720 i dont say that he cant be beat but you must give me time you must give me time
734721 a seven per cent solution would you care to try it
734722 my constitution has not got over the afghan campaign yet i cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it
734723 i suppose that its influence is physically a bad one i find it however so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment
734724 count the cost your brain may as you say be roused and excited but it is a pathological and morbid process which involves increased tissue change and may at last leave a permanent weakness you know too what a black reaction comes upon you surely the game is hardly worth the candle why should you for a mere passing pleasure risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed remember that i speak not only as one comrade to another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable
734725 rebels at stagnation give me problems give me work give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis and i am in my own proper atmosphere i can dispense then with artificial stimulants but i abhor the dull routine of existence i crave for mental exaltation that is why i have chosen my own particular profession or rather created it for i am the only one in the world
734726 i am the last and highest court of appeal in detection when gregson or lestrade or athelney jones are out of their depths which by the way is their normal state the matter is laid before me i examine the data as an expert and pronounce a specialists opinion i claim no credit in such cases my name figures in no newspaper the work itself the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers is my highest reward but you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the jefferson hope case
734727 honestly i cannot congratulate you upon it detection is or ought to be an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner you have attempted to tinge it with romanticism which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid
734728 some facts should be suppressed or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them the only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which i succeeded in unravelling it
734729 i was consulted last week by francois le villard 1 who as you probably know has come rather to the front lately in the french detective service he has all the celtic power of quick intuition but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art the case was concerned with a will and possessed some features of interest i was able to refer him to two parallel cases the one at riga in 1857 and the other at st louis in 1871 which have suggested to him the true solution here is the letter which i had this morning acknowledging my assistance
734730 he has considerable gifts himself he possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective he has the power of observation and that of deduction he is only wanting in knowledge and that may come in time he is now translating my small works into french
734731 yes i have been guilty of several monographs they are all upon technical subjects here for example is one upon the distinction between the ashes of the various tobaccoes in it i enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar cigarette and pipe tobacco with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash it is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue if you can say definitely for example that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an indian lunkah it obviously narrows your field of search to the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a trichinopoly and the white fluff of as there is between a cabbage and a potato
734732 i appreciate their importance here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of paris as a preserver of impresses here too is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand with lithotypes of the hands of slaters sailors cork cutters compositors weavers and diamond polishers that is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective especially in cases of unclaimed bodies or in discovering the antecedents of criminals but i weary you with my hobby
734733 it is of the greatest interest to me especially since i have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it but you spoke just now of observation and deduction surely the one to some extent implies the other
734734 for example observation shows me that you have been to the wigmore street post office this morning but deduction lets me know that when there you despatched a telegram
734735 right on both points but i confess that i dont see how you arrived at it it was a sudden impulse upon my part and i have mentioned it to no one
734736 so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep just opposite the seymour street office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering the earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found as far as i know nowhere else in the neighborhood so much is observation the rest is deduction
734737 why of course i knew that you had not written a letter since i sat opposite to you all morning i see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post cards what could you go into the post office for then but to send a wire eliminate all other factors and the one which remains must be the truth
734738 the thing however is as you say of the simplest would you think me impertinent if i were to put your theories to a more severe test
734739 it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine i should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me
734740 i have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it now i have here a watch which has recently come into my possession would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner
734741 the watch has been recently cleaned which robs me of my most suggestive facts
734742 subject to your correction i should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother who inherited it from your father
734743 that you gather no doubt from the h w upon the back
734744 quite so the w suggests your own name the date of the watch is nearly fifty years back and the initials are as old as the watch so it was made for the last generation jewelry usually descends to the eldest son and he is most likely to have the same name as the father your father has if i remember right been dead many years it has therefore been in the hands of your eldest brother
734745 he was a man of untidy habits very untidy and careless he was left with good prospects but he threw away his chances lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity and finally taking to drink he died that is all i can gather
734746 i could not have believed that you would have descended to this you have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way you cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch it is unkind and to speak plainly has a touch of charlatanism in it
734747 pray accept my apologies viewing the matter as an abstract problem i had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you i assure you however that i never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch
734748 then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts they are absolutely correct in every particular
734749 ah that is good luck i could only say what was the balance of probability i did not at all expect to be so accurate
734750 no no i never guess it is a shocking habit destructive to the logical faculty what seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend for example i began by stating that your brother was careless when you observe the lower part of that watch case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects such as coins or keys in the same pocket surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man neither is it a very far fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects
734751 it is very customary for pawnbrokers in england when they take a watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin point upon the inside of the case it is more handy than a label as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed there are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case inference that your brother was often at low water secondary inference that he had occasional bursts of prosperity or he could not have redeemed the pledge finally i ask you to look at the inner plate which contains the key hole look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole marks where the key has slipped what sober mans key could have scored those grooves but you will never see a drunkards watch without them he winds it at night and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand where is the mystery in all this
734752 i regret the injustice which i did you i should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty may i ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present
734753 none hence the cocaine i cannot live without brain work what else is there to live for stand at the window here was ever such a dreary dismal unprofitable world see how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun colored houses what could be more hopelessly prosaic and material what is the use of having powers doctor when one has no field upon which to exert them crime is commonplace existence is commonplace and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth
734754 hum i have no recollection of the name ask the young lady to step up mrs hudson dont go doctor i should prefer that you remain
734755 because you once enabled my employer mrs cecil forrester to unravel a little domestic complication she was much impressed by your kindness and skill
734756 i believe that i was of some slight service to her the case however as i remember it was a very simple one
734757 she did not think so but at least you cannot say the same of mine i can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which i find myself
734758 would be good enough to stop he might be of inestimable service to me
734759 he disappeared upon the 3d of december 1878 nearly ten years ago
734760 remained at the hotel there was nothing in it to suggest a clue some clothes some books and a considerable number of curiosities from the andaman islands he had been one of the officers in charge of the convict guard there
734761 only one that we know of major sholto of his own regiment the 34th bombay infantry the major had retired some little time before and lived at upper norwood we communicated with him of course but he did not even know that his brother officer was in england
734762 i have not yet described to you the most singular part about six years ago to be exact upon the 4th of may 1882 an advertisement appeared in the times asking for the address of miss mary morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward there was no name or address appended i had at that time just entered the family of mrs cecil forrester in the capacity of governess by her advice i published my address in the advertisement column the same day there arrived through the post a small card board box addressed to me which i found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl no word of writing was enclosed since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box containing a similar pearl without any clue as to the sender they have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value you can see for yourselves that they are very handsome
734763 yes and no later than to day that is why i have come to you this morning i received this letter which you will perhaps read for yourself
734764 the envelope too please post mark london s w date july 7 4 hum mans thumb mark on corner probably postman best quality paper envelopes at sixpence a packet particular man in his stationery no address be at the third pillar from the left outside the lyceum theatre to night at seven oclock if you are distrustful bring two friends you are a wronged woman and shall have justice do not bring police if you do all will be in vain your unknown friend well really this is a very pretty little mystery what do you intend to do miss morstan
734765 then we shall most certainly go you and i and yes why dr watson is the very man your correspondent says two friends he and i have worked together before
734766 i have led a retired life and have no friends whom i could appeal to if i am here at six it will do i suppose
734767 there is one other point however is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl box addresses
734768 you are certainly a model client you have the correct intuition let us see now
734769 but there can be no question as to the authorship see how the irrepressible greek e will break out and see the twirl of the final s they are undoubtedly by the same person i should not like to suggest false hopes miss morstan but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father
734770 i expected to hear you say so we shall look out for you then at six pray allow me to keep the papers i may look into the matter before then it is only half past three au revoir then
734771 not to allow your judgment to be biassed by personal qualities a client is to me a mere unit a factor in a problem the emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning i assure you that the most winning woman i ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance money and the most repellent man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the london poor
734772 i never make exceptions an exception disproves the rule have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting what do you make of this fellows scribble
734773 a man of business habits and some force of character
734774 they hardly rise above the common herd that d might be an a and that l an e men of character always differentiate their long letters however illegibly they may write there is vacillation in his k s and self esteem in his capitals i am going out now i have some few references to make let me recommend this book one of the most remarkable ever penned it is winwood reades martyrdom of man i shall be back in an hour
734775 well that would be too much to say i have discovered a suggestive fact that is all it is however very suggestive the details are still to be added i have just found on consulting the back files of the times that major sholto of upper norwood late of the 34th bombay infantry died upon the 28th of april 1882
734776 i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggests
734777 no you surprise me look at it in this way then captain morstan disappears the only person in london whom he could have visited is major sholto major sholto denies having heard that he was in london four years later sholto dies within a week of his death captain morstans daughter receives a valuable present which is repeated from year to year and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the presents begin immediately after sholtos death unless it is that sholtos heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts
734778 but what a strange compensation and how strangely made why too should he write a letter now rather than six years ago again the letter speaks of giving her justice what justice can she have it is too much to suppose that her father is still alive there is no other injustice in her case that you know of
734779 but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here is a four wheeler and miss morstan is inside are you all ready then we had better go down for it is a little past the hour
734780 his letters were full of allusions to the major he and papa were in command of the troops at the andaman islands so they were thrown a great deal together by the way a curious paper was found in papas desk which no one could understand i dont suppose that it is of the slightest importance but i thought you might care to see it so i brought it with me it is here
734781 it has at some time been pinned to a board the diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls corridors and passages at one point is a small cross done in red ink and above it is 3 37 from left in faded pencil writing in the left hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching beside it is written in very rough and coarse characters the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar no i confess that i do not see how this bears upon the matter yet it is evidently a document of importance it has been kept carefully in a pocket book for the one side is as clean as the other
734782 it was in his pocket book that we found it
734783 preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of use to us i begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than i at first supposed i must reconsider my ideas
734784 i am miss morstan and these two gentlemen are my friends
734785 but i was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police officer
734786 now vincent square now we come out on the vauxhall bridge road we are making for the surrey side apparently yes i thought so now we are on the bridge you can catch glimpses of the river
734787 priory road lark hall lane stockwell place robert street cold harbor lane our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions
734788 your servant gentlemen pray step into my little sanctum a small place miss but furnished to my own liking an oasis of art in the howling desert of south london
734789 have you your stethoscope might i ask you would you have the kindness i have grave doubts as to my mitral valve if you would be so very good the aortic i may rely upon but i should value your opinion upon the mitral
734790 i am a great sufferer and i have long had suspicions as to that valve i am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted had your father miss morstan refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart he might have been alive now
734791 and what is more i can do you justice and i will too whatever brother bartholomew may say i am so glad to have your friends here not only as an escort to you but also as witnesses to what i am about to do and say the three of us can show a bold front to brother bartholomew but let us have no outsiders no police or officials we can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves without any interference nothing would annoy brother bartholomew more than any publicity
734792 whatever you may choose to say will go no further
734793 may i offer you a glass of chianti miss morstan or of tokay i keep no other wines shall i open a flask no well then i trust that you have no objection to tobacco smoke to the mild balsamic odor of the eastern tobacco i am a little nervous and i find my hookah an invaluable sedative
734794 when i first determined to make this communication to you
734795 i might have given you my address but i feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you i took the liberty therefore of making an appointment in such a way that my man williams might be able to see you first i have complete confidence in his discretion and he had orders if he were dissatisfied to proceed no further in the matter you will excuse these precautions but i am a man of somewhat retiring and i might even say refined tastes and there is nothing more unaesthetic 5 than a policeman i have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism i seldom come in contact with the rough crowd i live as you see with some little atmosphere of elegance around me i may call myself a patron of the arts it is my weakness the landscape is a genuine corot and though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that salvator rosa there cannot be the least question about the bouguereau i am partial to the modern french school
734796 but i am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me it is very late and i should desire the interview to be as short as possible
734797 for we shall certainly have to go to norwood and see brother bartholomew we shall all go and try if we can get the better of brother bartholomew he is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me i had quite high words with him last night you cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry
734798 if we are to go to norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once
734799 my father was as you may have guessed major john sholto
734800 i very well remember the sensation which was caused by the
734801 early in 1882 my father received a letter from india which
734802 when we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and
734803 i have only one thing he said which weighs upon my
734804 i will tell you how morstan died he continued he had
734805 for a long time i sat half distracted wondering what i
734806 i was still pondering over the matter when looking up
734807 no one need know that you have killed him let us hide him away and who is the wiser
734808 i heard you quarrel and i heard the blow but my lips are sealed all are asleep in the house let us put him away together
734809 we searched the garden that night but found no sign of the intruder save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower bed but for that one trace we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild fierce face we soon however had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us the window of my fathers room was found open in the morning his cupboards and boxes had been rifled and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words the sign of the four scrawled across it what the phrase meant or who our secret visitor may have been we never knew as far as we can judge none of my fathers property had been actually stolen though everything had been turned out my brother and i naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life but it is still a complete mystery to us
734810 were as you may imagine much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of for weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without discovering its whereabouts it was maddening to think that the hiding place was on his very lips at the moment that he died we could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out over this chaplet my brother bartholomew and i had some little discussion the pearls were evidently of great value and he was averse to part with them for between friends my brother was himself a little inclined to my fathers fault he thought too that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble it was all that i could do to persuade him to let me find out miss morstans address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute
734811 that was the view which i took of it though brother bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light we had plenty of money ourselves i desired no more besides it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion le mauvais gout mene au crime 6 the french have a very neat way of putting these things our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that i thought it best to set up rooms for myself so i left pondicherry lodge taking the old khitmutgar and williams with me yesterday however i learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred the treasure has been discovered i instantly communicated with miss morstan and it only remains for us to drive out to norwood and demand our share i explained my views last night to brother bartholomew so we shall be expected if not welcome visitors
734812 it is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you but as miss morstan remarked just now it is late and we had best put the matter through without delay
734813 how do you think he found out where the treasure was he had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere in doors so he worked out all the cubic space of the house and made measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for among other things he found that the height of the building was seventy four feet but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms and making every allowance for the space between which he ascertained by borings he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet there were four feet unaccounted for these could only be at the top of the building he knocked a hole therefore in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room and there sure enough he came upon another little garret above it which had been sealed up and was known to no one in the centre stood the treasure chest resting upon two rafters he lowered it through the hole and there it lies he computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling
734814 it is i mcmurdo you surely know my knock by this time
734815 that you mr thaddeus but who are the others i had no orders about them from the master
734816 no mcmurdo you surprise me i told my brother last night that i should bring some friends
734817 he haint been out o his room to day mr thaddeus and i have no orders you know very well that i must stick to regulations i can let you in but your friends they must just stop where they are
734818 if i guarantee them that is enough for you there is the young lady too she cannot wait on the public road at this hour
734819 folk may be friends o yours and yet no friends o the masters he pays me well to do my duty and my duty ill do i dont know none o your friends
734820 i dont think you can have forgotten me dont you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at alisons rooms on the night of your benefit four years back
734821 gods truth how could i have mistook you if instead o standin there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross hit of yours under the jaw id ha known you without a question ah youre one that has wasted your gifts you have you might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy
734822 you see watson if all else fails me i have still one of the scientific professions open to me
734823 our friend wont keep us out in the cold now i am sure
734824 in you come sir in you come you and your friends
734825 very sorry mr thaddeus but orders are very strict had to be certain of your friends before i let them in
734826 there must be some mistake i distinctly told bartholomew that we should be here and yet there is no light in his window i do not know what to make of it
734827 yes he has followed my fathers custom he was the favorite son you know and i sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me that is bartholomews window up there where the moonshine strikes it is quite bright but there is no light from within i think
734828 but i see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door
734829 ah that is the housekeepers room that is where old mrs bernstone sits she can tell us all about it but perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two for if we all go in together and she has had no word of our coming she may be alarmed but hush what is that
734830 she is the only woman in the house wait here i shall be back in a moment
734831 oh mr thaddeus sir i am so glad you have come i am so glad you have come mr thaddeus sir
734832 it looks as though all the moles in england had been let loose in it i have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near ballarat where the prospectors had been at work
734833 these are the traces of the treasure seekers you must remember that they were six years looking for it no wonder that the grounds look like a gravel pit
734834 it does me good to see you oh but i have been sorely tried this day
734835 master has locked himself in and will not answer me
734836 all day i have waited to hear from him for he often likes to be alone but an hour ago i feared that something was amiss so i went up and peeped through the key hole you must go up mr thaddeus you must go up and look for yourself i have seen mr bartholomew sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years but i never saw him with such a face on him as that
734837 it is a thorn you may pick it out but be careful for it is poisoned
734838 it clears every instant i only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case
734839 they have robbed him of the treasure there is the hole through which we lowered it i helped him to do it i was the last person who saw him i left him here last night and i heard him lock the door as i came down stairs
734840 it was ten oclock and now he is dead and the police will be called in and i shall be suspected of having had a hand in it oh yes i am sure i shall but you dont think so gentlemen surely you dont think that it was i is it likely that i would have brought you here if it were i oh dear oh dear i know that i shall go mad
734841 take my advice and drive down to the station to report the matter to the police offer to assist them in every way we shall wait here until your return
734842 we have half an hour to ourselves let us make good use of it my case is as i have told you almost complete but we must not err on the side of over confidence simple as the case seems now there may be something deeper underlying it
734843 just sit in the corner there that your footprints may not complicate matters now to work in the first place how did these folk come and how did they go the door has not been opened since last night how of the window
734844 window is snibbed on the inner side framework is solid no hinges at the side let us open it no water pipe near roof quite out of reach yet a man has mounted by the window it rained a little last night here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill and here is a circular muddy mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table see here watson this is really a very pretty demonstration
734845 it is something much more valuable to us it is the impression of a wooden stump you see here on the sill is the boot mark a heavy boot with a broad metal heel and beside it is the mark of the timber toe
734846 quite so but there has been some one else a very able and efficient ally could you scale that wall doctor
734847 without aid it is so but suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which i see in the corner securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall then i think if you were an active man you might swarm up wooden leg and all you would depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside and get away in the way that he originally came as a minor point it may be noted
734848 that our wooden legged friend though a fair climber was not a professional sailor his hands were far from horny my lens discloses more than one blood mark especially towards the end of the rope from which i gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand
734849 but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever how about this mysterious ally how came he into the room
734850 there are features of interest about this ally he lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace i fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country though parallel cases suggest themselves from india and if my memory serves me from senegambia
734851 the door is locked the window is inaccessible was it through the chimney
734852 how often have i said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth we know that he did not come through the door the window or the chimney we also know that he could not have been concealed in the room as there is no concealment possible whence then did he come
734853 of course he did he must have done so if you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our researches to the room above the secret room in which the treasure was found
734854 this is a trap door which leads out on to the roof i can press it back and here is the roof itself sloping at a gentle angle this then is the way by which number one entered let us see if we can find some other traces of his individuality
734855 but the thing is quite natural my memory failed me or i should have been able to foretell it there is nothing more to be learned here let us go down
734856 you know my methods apply them and it will be instructive to compare results
734857 i think that there is nothing else of importance here but i will look
734858 we ought to have very little trouble now number one has had the misfortune to tread in the creasote 7 you can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil smelling mess the carboy has been cracked you see and the stuff has leaked out
734859 i know a dog that would follow that scent to the worlds end if a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire how far can a specially trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this it sounds like a sum in the rule of three the answer should give us the but hallo here are the accredited representatives of the law
734860 just put your hand here on this poor fellows arm and here on his leg what do you feel
734861 quite so they are in a state of extreme contraction far exceeding the usual rigor mortis coupled with this distortion of the face this hippocratic smile or risus sardonicus as the old writers called it what conclusion would it suggest to your mind
734862 that was the idea which occurred to me the instant i saw the drawn muscles of the face on getting into the room i at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system as you saw i discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp you observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair now examine this thorn
734863 with all these data you should be able to draw some just inference but here are the regulars so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat
734864 heres a pretty business but who are all these why the house seems to be as full as a rabbit warren
734865 its mr sherlock holmes the theorist remember you ill never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the bishopgate jewel case its true you set us on the right track but youll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance
734866 oh come now come never be ashamed to own up but what is all this bad business bad business stern facts here no room for theories how lucky that i happened to be out at norwood over another case i was at the station when the message arrived what dyou think the man died of
734867 oh this is hardly a case for me to theorize over
734868 no no still we cant deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes dear me door locked i understand jewels worth half a million missing how was the window
734869 well well if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter thats common sense man might have died in a fit but then the jewels are missing ha i have a theory these flashes come upon me at times just step outside sergeant and you mr sholto your friend can remain what do you think of this holmes sholto was on his own confession with his brother last night the brother died in a fit on which sholto walked off with the treasure hows that
734870 on which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside
734871 hum theres a flaw there let us apply common sense to the matter this thaddeus sholto was with his brother there was a quarrel so much we know the brother is dead and the jewels are gone so much also we know no one saw the brother from the time thaddeus left him his bed had not been slept in thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind his appearance is well not attractive you see that i am weaving my web round thaddeus the net begins to close upon him
734872 you are not quite in possession of the facts yet
734873 this splinter of wood which i have every reason to believe to be poisoned was in the mans scalp where you still see the mark this card inscribed as you see it was on the table and beside it lay this rather curious stone headed instrument how does all that fit into your theory
734874 house is full of indian curiosities thaddeus brought this up and if this splinter be poisonous thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man the card is some hocus pocus a blind as like as not the only question is how did he depart ah of course here is a hole in the roof
734875 facts are better than mere theories after all my view of the case is confirmed there is a trap door communicating with the roof and it is partly open
734876 well whoever noticed it it shows how our gentleman got away inspector
734877 ask mr sholto to step this way mr sholto it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you i arrest you in the queens name as being concerned in the death of your brother
734878 i think that i can engage to clear you of the charge
734879 dont promise too much mr theorist dont promise too much
734880 you may find it a harder matter than you think
734881 not only will i clear him mr jones but i will make you a
734882 i hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them a word with you watson
734883 has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey
734884 it is not right that miss morstan should remain in this stricken house
734885 no you must escort her home she lives with mrs cecil forrester in lower camberwell so it is not very far i will wait for you here if you will drive out again or perhaps you are too tired
734886 by no means i dont think i could rest until i know more of this fantastic business i have seen something of the rough side of life but i give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to night has shaken my nerve completely i should like however to see the matter through with you now that i have got so far
734887 we shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow jones to exult over any which he may choose to construct when you have dropped miss morstan i wish you to go on to no 3 pinchin lane down near the waters edge at lambeth the third house on the right hand side is a sherman is the name you will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window knock old sherman up and tell him with my compliments that i want toby at once you will bring toby back in the cab with you
734888 yes a queer mongrel with a most amazing power of scent i would rather have tobys help than that of the whole detective force of london
734889 it is one now i ought to be back before three if i can get a fresh horse
734890 shall see what i can learn from mrs bernstone and from the indian servant who mr thaddeus tells me sleeps in the next garret then i shall study the great joness methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms wir sind gewohnt dass die menschen verhohnen was sie nicht verstehen goethe is always pithy
734891 if you kick up any more row ill open the kennels and let out forty three dogs upon you
734892 if youll let one out its just what i have come for
734893 so help me gracious i have a wiper in this bag an ill drop it on your ead if you dont hook it
734894 now stand clear for when i say three down goes the wiper
734895 step in sir keep clear of the badger for he bites ah naughty naughty would you take a nip at the gentleman
734896 dont mind that sir its only a slow worm it haint got no fangs so i gives it the run o the room for it keeps the beetles down you must not mind my bein just a little short wi you at first for im guyed at by the children and theres many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up what was it that mr sherlock holmes wanted sir
734897 good dog then athelney jones has gone we have had an immense display of energy since you left he has arrested not only friend thaddeus but the gatekeeper the housekeeper and the indian servant we have the place to ourselves but for a sergeant up stairs leave the dog here and come up
734898 now tie this bit of card 10 round my neck so as to hang it in front of me thank you now i must kick off my boots and stockings just you carry them down with you watson i am going to do a little climbing and dip my handkerchief into the creasote that will do now come up into the garret with me for a moment
734899 not at all look here this is the print of a right foot in the dust now i make one with my naked foot beside it what is the chief difference
734900 your toes are all cramped together the other print has each toe distinctly divided
734901 quite so that is the point bear that in mind now would you kindly step over to that flap window and smell the edge of the wood work i shall stay over here as i have this handkerchief in my hand
734902 that is where he put his foot in getting out if you can trace him i should think that toby will have no difficulty now run downstairs loose the dog and look out for blondin
734903 this is the place what is that black thing down there
734904 confound the fellow its a most break neck place i ought to be able to come down where he could climb up the water pipe feels pretty firm here goes anyhow
734905 tiles were loosened the whole way along and in his hurry he had dropped this it confirms my diagnosis as you doctors express it
734906 look out that you dont prick yourself im delighted to have them for the chances are that they are all he has there is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long i would sooner face a martini bullet myself are you game for a six mile trudge watson
734907 here you are doggy good old toby smell it toby smell it
734908 you see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster what a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight and twenty hours start
734909 that i depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical i have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways this however is the readiest and since fortune has put it into our hands i should be culpable if i neglected it it has however prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be there might have been some credit to be gained out of it but for this too palpable clue
734910 i assure you holmes that i marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case even more than i did in the jefferson hope murder the thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable how for example could you describe with such confidence the wooden legged man
734911 pshaw my dear boy it was simplicity itself i dont wish to be theatrical it is all patent and above board two officers who are in command of a convict guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure a map is drawn for them by an englishman named jonathan small you remember that we saw the name upon the chart in captain morstans possession he had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically called it aided by this chart the officers or one of them gets the treasure and brings it to england leaving we will suppose some condition under which he received it unfulfilled now then why did not jonathan small get the treasure himself the answer is obvious the chart is dated at a time when morstan was brought into close association with convicts jonathan small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away
734912 it is more than that it is the only hypothesis which covers the facts let us see how it fits in with the sequel major sholto remains at peace for some years happy in the possession of his treasure then he receives a letter from india which gives him a great fright what was that
734913 a letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free
734914 or had escaped that is much more likely for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was it would not have been a surprise to him what does he do then he guards himself against a wooden legged man a white man mark you for he mistakes a white tradesman for him and actually fires a pistol at him now only one white mans name is on the chart the others are hindoos or mohammedans there is no other white man therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden legged man is identical with jonathan small does the reasoning strike you as being faulty
734915 well now let us put ourselves in the place of jonathan small let us look at it from his point of view he comes to england with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him he found out where sholto lived and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house there is this butler lal rao whom we have not seen mrs bernstone gives him far from a good character small could not find out however where the treasure was hid for no one ever knew save the major and one faithful servant who had died suddenly small learns that the major is on his death bed in a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him he runs the gauntlet of the guards makes his way to the dying mans window and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons mad with hate however against the dead man he enters the room that night searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card he had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder but from the point of view of the four associates something in the nature of an act of justice whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal do you follow all this
734916 now what could jonathan small do he could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure possibly he leaves england and only comes back at intervals then comes the discovery of the garret and he is instantly informed of it we again trace the presence of some confederate in the household jonathan with his wooden leg is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of bartholomew sholto he takes with him however a rather curious associate who gets over this difficulty but dips his naked foot into creasote whence come toby and a six mile limp for a half pay officer with a damaged tendo achillis
734917 but it was the associate and not jonathan who committed the crime
734918 quite so and rather to jonathans disgust to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room he bore no grudge against bartholomew sholto and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged he did not wish to put his head in a halter there was no help for it however the savage instincts of his companion had broken out and the poison had done its work so jonathan small left his record lowered the treasure box to the ground and followed it himself that was the train of events as far as i can decipher them of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle aged and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the andamans his height is readily calculated from the length of his stride and we know that he was bearded his hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon thaddeus sholto when he saw him at the window i dont know that there is anything else
734919 ah well there is no great mystery in that but you will know all about it soon enough how sweet the morning air is see how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the london cloud bank it shines on a good many folk but on none i dare bet who are on a stranger errand than you and i how small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature are you well up in your jean paul
734920 that was like following the brook to the parent lake he makes one curious but profound remark it is that the chief proof of mans real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness it argues you see a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility there is much food for thought in richter you have not a pistol have you
734921 it is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair jonathan i shall leave to you but if the other turns nasty i shall shoot him dead
734922 they surely would not take a cab or go off in a balloon
734923 if you consider how much creasote is carted about london in one day it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed it is much used now especially for the seasoning of wood poor toby is not to blame
734924 we must get on the main scent again i suppose
734925 yes and fortunately we have no distance to go evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of knights place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions we took the wrong one it only remains to follow the other
734926 we must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creosote barrel came from
734927 i had thought of that but you notice that he keeps on the pavement whereas the barrel passed down the roadway no we are on the true scent now
734928 these fellows are sharper than i expected they seem to have covered their tracks there has i fear been preconcerted management here
734929 come back you young imp for if your father comes home and finds you like that hell let us hear of it
734930 what a rosy cheeked young rascal now jack is there anything you would like
734931 here you are then catch a fine child mrs smith
734932 lor bless you sir he is that and forward he gets amost too much for me to manage specially when my man is away days at a time
734933 i am sorry for that for i wanted to speak to mr smith
734934 hes been away since yesterday mornin sir and truth to tell i am beginnin to feel frightened about him but if it was about a boat sir maybe i could serve as well
734935 why bless you sir it is in the steam launch that he has gone thats what puzzles me for i know there aint more coals in her than would take her to about woolwich and back if hed been away in the barge id ha thought nothin for many a time a job has taken him as far as gravesend and then if there was much doin there he might ha stayed over but what good is a steam launch without coals
734936 he might have bought some at a wharf down the river
734937 he might sir but it werent his way many a time ive heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags besides i dont like that wooden legged man wi his ugly face and outlandish talk what did he want always knockin about here for
734938 yes sir a brown monkey faced chap thats called moren once for my old man it was him that roused him up yesternight and whats more my man knew he was comin for he had steam up in the launch i tell you straight sir i dont feel easy in my mind about it
734939 you are frightening yourself about nothing how could you possibly tell that it was the wooden legged man who came in the night i dont quite understand how you can be so sure
734940 his voice sir i knew his voice which is kind o thick and foggy he tapped at the winder about three it would be show a leg matey says he time to turn out guard my old man woke up jim thats my eldest and away they went without so much as a word to me i could hear the wooden leg clackin on the stones
734941 couldnt say i am sure sir i didnt hear no one else
734942 i am sorry mrs smith for i wanted a steam launch and i have heard good reports of the let me see what is her name
734943 ah shes not that old green launch with a yellow line very broad in the beam
734944 no indeed shes as trim a little thing as any on the river shes been fresh painted black with two red streaks
734945 thanks i hope that you will hear soon from mr smith i am going down the river and if i should see anything of the aurora i shall let him know that you are uneasy a black funnel you say
734946 ah of course it was the sides which were black
734947 is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you if you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster if you listen to them under protest as it were you are very likely to get what you want
734948 i would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the aurora
734949 my dear fellow it would be a colossal task she may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and greenwich below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing places for miles it would take you days and days to exhaust them if you set about it alone
734950 no i shall probably call athelney jones in at the last moment he is not a bad fellow and i should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally but i have a fancy for working it out myself now that we have gone so far
734951 worse and worse our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels and they would be off out of the country as it is they are likely enough to leave but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry joness energy will be of use to us there for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent
734952 take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hours sleep it is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to night again stop at a telegraph office cabby we will keep toby for he may be of use to us yet
734953 you remember the baker street division of the detective police force whom i employed in the jefferson hope case
734954 this is just the case where they might be invaluable if they fail i have other resources but i shall try them first that wire was to my dirty little lieutenant wiggins and i expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast
734955 the energetic jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them but you have had enough of the case better have your ham and eggs first
734956 mr bartholomew sholto of pondicherry lodge upper norwood was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play as far as we can learn no actual traces of violence were found upon mr sholtos person but a valuable collection of indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off the discovery was first made by mr sherlock holmes and dr watson who had called at the house with mr thaddeus sholto brother of the deceased by a singular piece of good fortune mr athelney jones the well known member of the detective police force happened to be at the norwood police station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm his trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals with the gratifying result that the brother thaddeus sholto has already been arrested together with the housekeeper mrs bernstone an indian butler named lal rao and a porter or gatekeeper named mcmurdo it is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house for mr joness well known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building and so through a trap door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found this fact which has been very clearly made out proves conclusively that it was no mere hap hazard burglary the prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind we cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate
734957 i think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime
734958 so do i i wouldnt answer for our safety now if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy
734959 no its not quite so bad as that it is the unofficial force the baker street irregulars
734960 and brought em on sharp three bob and a tanner for tickets
734961 in future they can report to you wiggins and you to me i cannot have the house invaded in this way however it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions i want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the aurora owner mordecai smith black with two red streaks funnel black with a white band she is down the river somewhere i want one boy to be at mordecai smiths landing stage opposite millbank to say if the boat comes back you must divide it out among yourselves and do both banks thoroughly let me know the moment you have news is that all clear
734962 the old scale of pay and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat heres a day in advance now off you go
734963 if the launch is above water they will find her
734964 they can go everywhere see everything overhear every one i expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her in the mean while we can do nothing but await results we cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the aurora or mr mordecai smith
734965 toby could eat these scraps i dare say are you going to bed holmes
734966 no i am not tired i have a curious constitution i never remember feeling tired by work though idleness exhausts me completely i am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us if ever man had an easy task this of ours ought to be wooden legged men are not so common but the other man must i should think be absolutely unique
734967 i have no wish to make a mystery of him to you anyway but you must have formed your own opinion now do consider the data diminutive footmarks toes never fettered by boots naked feet stone headed wooden mace great agility small poisoned darts what do you make of all this
734968 perhaps one of those indians who were the associates of jonathan small
734969 when first i saw signs of strange weapons i was inclined to think so but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views some of the inhabitants of the indian peninsula are small men but none could have left such marks as that the hindoo proper has long and thin feet the sandal wearing mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others because the thong is commonly passed between these little darts too could only be shot in one way they are from a blow pipe now then where are we to find our savage
734970 the aborigines of the andaman islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth though some anthropologists prefer the bushmen of africa the digger indians of america and the terra del fuegians the average height is rather below four feet although many full grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this they are a fierce morose and intractable people though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained mark that watson now then listen to this they are naturally hideous having large misshapen heads small fierce eyes and distorted features their feet and hands however are remarkably small so intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the british officials have failed to win them over in any degree they have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews braining the survivors with their stone headed clubs or shooting them with their poisoned arrows these massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast nice amiable people watson if this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn i fancy that even as it is jonathan small would give a good deal not to have employed him
734971 but how came he to have so singular a companion
734972 ah that is more than i can tell since however we had already determined that small had come from the andamans it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him no doubt we shall know all about it in time look here watson you look regularly done lie down there on the sofa and see if i can put you to sleep
734973 unfortunately no i confess that i am surprised and disappointed i expected something definite by this time wiggins has just been up to report he says that no trace can be found of the launch it is a provoking check for every hour is of importance
734974 can i do anything i am perfectly fresh now and quite ready for another nights outing
734975 no we can do nothing we can only wait if we go ourselves the message might come in our absence and delay be caused you can do what you will but i must remain on guard
734976 then i shall run over to camberwell and call upon mrs cecil forrester she asked me to yesterday
734977 well of course on miss morstan too they were anxious to hear what happened
734978 women are never to be entirely trusted not the best of them
734979 all right good luck but i say if you are crossing the river you may as well return toby for i dont think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now
734980 an injured lady half a million in treasure a black cannibal and a wooden legged ruffian they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl
734981 why mary your fortune depends upon the issue of this search i dont think that you are nearly excited enough just imagine what it must be to be so rich and to have the world at your feet
734982 it is for mr thaddeus sholto that i am anxious
734983 nothing else is of any consequence but i think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout it is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge
734984 no sir he has gone to his room sir do you know sir
734985 well hes that strange sir after you was gone he walked and he walked up and down and up and down until i was weary of the sound of his footstep then i heard him talking to himself and muttering and every time the bell rang out he came on the stair head with what is that mrs hudson and now he has slammed off to his room but i can hear him walking away the same as ever i hope hes not going to be ill sir i ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine but he turned on me sir with such a look that i dont know how ever i got out of the room
734986 i dont think that you have any cause to be uneasy mrs hudson
734987 i have seen him like this before he has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless
734988 this infernal problem is consuming me it is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle when all else had been overcome i know the men the launch everything and yet i can get no news i have set other agencies at work and used every means at my disposal the whole river has been searched on either side but there is no news nor has mrs smith heard of her husband i shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft but there are objections to that
734989 or that mrs smith has put us on a wrong scent
734990 no i think that may be dismissed i had inquiries made and there is a launch of that description
734991 i have considered that possibility too and there is a search party who will work up as far as richmond if no news comes to day i shall start off myself to morrow and go for the men rather than the boat but surely surely we shall hear something
734992 i have been turning it over in my mind and i can see only one way out of it it is worth trying at all events
734993 no you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative i am loath to go for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day though wiggins was despondent about it last night i want you to open all notes and telegrams and to act on your own judgment if any news should come can i rely upon you
734994 i am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me for i can hardly tell yet where i may find myself if i am in luck however i may not be gone so very long i shall have news of some sort or other before i get back
734995 friend sholto is safe at any rate i wonder what the fresh clue may be though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder
734996 lost whereas mordecai smith boatman and his son jim left smiths wharf at or about three oclock last tuesday morning in the steam launch aurora black with two red stripes funnel black with a white band the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to mrs smith at smiths wharf or at 221 b baker street as to the whereabouts of the said mordecai smith and the launch aurora
734997 yes and i cannot be sure when he will be back but perhaps you would care to wait take that chair and try one of these cigars
734998 well half a glass it is very hot for the time of year and i have had a good deal to worry and try me you know my theory about this norwood case
734999 well i have been obliged to reconsider it i had my net drawn tightly round mr sholto sir when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it he was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken from the time that he left his brothers room he was never out of sight of some one or other so it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap doors its a very dark case and my professional credit is at stake i should be very glad of a little assistance
735000 your friend mr sherlock holmes is a wonderful man sir
735001 hes a man who is not to be beat i have known that young man go into a good many cases but i never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon he is irregular in his methods and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories but on the whole i think he would have made a most promising officer and i dont care who knows it i have had a wire from him this morning by which i understand that he has got some clue to this sholto business here is his message
735002 if i have not returned wait for me i am close on the track of the sholto gang you can come with us to night if you want to be in at the finish
735003 this sounds well he has evidently picked up the scent again
735004 even the best of us are thrown off sometimes of course this may prove to be a false alarm but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip but there is some one at the door perhaps this is he
735005 no but i am acting for him you can tell me any message you have for him
735006 it was to him himself i was to tell it
735007 but i tell you that i am acting for him was it about mordecai smiths boat
735008 yes i knows well where it is an i knows where the men he is after are an i knows where the treasure is i knows all about it
735009 no no i aint goin to lose a whole day to please no one if mr holmes aint here then mr holmes must find it all out for himself i dont care about the look of either of you and i wont tell a word
735010 you have important information and you must not walk off we shall keep you whether you like or not until our friend returns
735011 i come here to see a gentleman and you two who i never saw in my life seize me and treat me in this fashion
735012 we shall recompense you for the loss of your time sit over here on the sofa and you will not have long to wait
735013 i think that you might offer me a cigar too
735014 here he is wig whiskers eyebrows and all i thought my disguise was pretty good but i hardly expected that it would stand that test
735015 you would have made an actor and a rare one you had the proper workhouse cough and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week i thought i knew the glint of your eye though you didnt get away from us so easily you see
735016 i have been working in that get up all day
735017 you see a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases so i can only go on the war path under some simple disguise like this you got my wire
735018 it has all come to nothing i have had to release two of my prisoners and there is no evidence against the other two
735019 never mind we shall give you two others in the place of them but you must put yourself under my orders you are welcome to all the official credit but you must act on the lines that i point out is that agreed
735020 well then in the first place i shall want a fast police boat a steam launch to be at the westminster stairs at seven oclock
735021 that is easily managed there is always one about there but i can step across the road and telephone to make sure
735022 then i shall want two stanch men in case of resistance
735023 there will be two or three in the boat what else
735024 when we secure the men we shall get the treasure i think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs let her be the first to open it eh watson
735025 however the whole thing is irregular and i suppose we must wink at it the treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation
735026 certainly that is easily managed one other point i should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of jonathan small himself you know i like to work the detail of my cases out there is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him either here in my rooms or elsewhere as long as he is efficiently guarded
735027 well you are master of the situation i have had no proof yet of the existence of this jonathan small however if you can catch him i dont see how i can refuse you an interview with him
735028 only that i insist upon your dining with us it will be ready in half an hour i have oysters and a brace of grouse with something a little choice in white wines watson you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper
735029 to the success of our little expedition and now it is high time we were off have you a pistol watson
735030 you had best take it then it is well to be prepared i see that the cab is at the door i ordered it for half past six
735031 is there anything to mark it as a police boat
735032 to the tower tell them to stop opposite to jacobsons yard
735033 we ought to be able to catch anything on the river
735034 well hardly that but there are not many launches to beat us
735035 we shall have to catch the aurora and she has a name for being a clipper i will tell you how the land lies watson you recollect how annoyed i was at being balked by so small a thing
735036 well i gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis one of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest so it is when i had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which i was at work at i came back to our problem of the sholtos and thought the whole matter out again my boys had been up the river and down the river without result the launch was not at any landing stage or wharf nor had it returned yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed i knew that this man small had a certain degree of low cunning but i did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse that is usually a product of higher education i then reflected that since he had certainly been in london some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over pondicherry lodge he could hardly leave at a moments notice but would need some little time if it were only a day to arrange his affairs that was the balance of probability at any rate
735037 it is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition
735038 no i hardly think so this lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it but a second consideration struck me jonathan small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion however much he may have top coated him would give rise to gossip and possibly be associated with this norwood tragedy he was quite sharp enough to see that they had started from their head quarters under cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it was broad light now it was past three oclock according to mrs smith when they got the boat it would be quite bright and people would be about in an hour or so therefore i argued they did not go very far they paid smith well to hold his tongue reserved his launch for the final escape and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure box in a couple of nights when they had time to see what view the papers took and whether there was any suspicion they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at gravesend or in the downs where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to america or the colonies
735039 but the launch they could not have taken that to their lodgings
735040 quite so i argued that the launch must be no great way off in spite of its invisibility i then put myself in the place of small and looked at it as a man of his capacity would he would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track how then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted i wondered what i should do myself if i were in his shoes i could only think of one way of doing it i might hand the launch over to some boat builder or repairer with directions to make a trifling change in her she would then be removed to his shed or yard and so be effectually concealed while at the same time i could have her at a few hours notice
735041 it is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked however i determined to act on the idea i started at once in this harmless seamans rig and inquired at all the yards down the river i drew blank at fifteen but at the sixteenth jacobsons i learned that the aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden legged man with some trivial directions as to her rudder there aint naught amiss with her rudder said the foreman there she lies with the red streaks at that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the missing owner he was rather the worse for liquor i should not of course have known him but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch i want her to night at eight oclock said he eight oclock sharp mind for i have two gentlemen who wont be kept waiting they had evidently paid him well for he was very flush of money chucking shillings about to the men i followed him some distance but he subsided into an ale house so i went back to the yard and happening to pick up one of my boys on the way i stationed him as a sentry over the launch he is to stand at the waters edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start we shall be lying off in the stream and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men treasure and all
735042 you have planned it all very neatly whether they are the right men or not
735043 but if the affair were in my hands i should have had a body of police in jacobsons yard and arrested them when they came down
735044 which would have been never this man small is a pretty shrewd fellow he would send a scout on ahead and if anything made him suspicious he would lie snug for another week
735045 but you might have stuck to mordecai smith and so been led to their hiding place
735046 in that case i should have wasted my day i think that it is a hundred to one against smith knowing where they live as long as he has liquor and good pay why should he ask questions they send him messages what to do no i thought over every possible course and this is the best
735047 cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters
735048 suppose we go down stream a short way and lie in wait for them
735049 it is certainly ten to one that they go down stream but we cannot be certain from this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they can hardly see us it will be a clear night and plenty of light we must stay where we are see how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight
735050 dirty looking rascals but i suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him you would not think it to look at them there is no a priori probability about it a strange enigma is man
735051 some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal
735052 he remarks that while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty you can for example never foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to individuals vary but percentages remain constant so says the statistician but do i see a handkerchief surely there is a white flutter over yonder
735053 and going like the devil full speed ahead engineer make after that launch with the yellow light by heaven i shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us
735054 heap it on stokers make her do all she can if we burn the boat we must have them
735055 we shall be up with her in a very few minutes
735056 i dont believe that i can swing over the job i give you my word on the book that i never raised hand against mr sholto it was that little hell hound tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him i had no part in it sir i was as grieved as if it had been my blood relation i welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it was done and i could not undo it again
735057 and you had best take a pull out of my flask for you are very wet how could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower mr sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope
735058 you seem to know as much about it as if you were there sir the truth is that i hoped to find the room clear i knew the habits of the house pretty well and it was the time when mr sholto usually went down to his supper i shall make no secret of the business the best defence that i can make is just the simple truth now if it had been the old major i would have swung for him with a light heart i would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar but its cursed hard that i should be lagged over this young sholto with whom i had no quarrel whatever
735059 you are under the charge of mr athelney jones of scotland yard he is going to bring you up to my rooms and i shall ask you for a true account of the matter you must make a clean breast of it for if you do i hope that i may be of use to you i think i can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room
735060 that he was sir i never got such a turn in my life as when i saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as i climbed through the window it fairly shook me sir id have half killed tonga for it if he had not scrambled off that was how he came to leave his club and some of his darts too as he tells me which i dare say helped to put you on our track though how you kept on it is more than i can tell i dont feel no malice against you for it but it does seem a queer thing
735061 that i who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the andamans and am like to spend the other half digging drains at dartmoor it was an evil day for me when first i clapped eyes upon the merchant achmet and had to do with the agra treasure which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it to him it brought murder to major sholto it brought fear and guilt to me it has meant slavery for life
735062 i think i shall have a pull at that flask holmes well i think we may all congratulate each other pity we didnt take the other alive but there was no choice i say holmes you must confess that you cut it rather fine it was all we could do to overhaul her
735063 but i certainly did not know that the aurora was such a clipper
735064 smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her he swears he knew nothing of this norwood business
735065 not a word i chose his launch because i heard that she was a flier we told him nothing but we paid him well and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel the esmeralda at gravesend outward bound for the brazils
735066 well if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him if we are pretty quick in catching our men we are not so quick in condemning them
735067 and shall land you dr watson with the treasure box i need hardly tell you that i am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this it is most irregular but of course an agreement is an agreement i must however as a matter of duty send an inspector with you since you have so valuable a charge you will drive no doubt
735068 it is a pity there is no key that we may make an inventory first you will have to break it open where is the key my man
735069 hum there was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble we have had work enough already through you however doctor i need not warn you to be careful bring the box back with you to the baker street rooms you will find us there on our way to the station
735070 i thought that mrs forrester had come back very early but i never dreamed that it might be you what news have you brought me
735071 i have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world i have brought you a fortune
735072 yes this is the great agra treasure half of it is yours and half is thaddeus sholtos you will have a couple of hundred thousand each think of that an annuity of ten thousand pounds there will be few richer young ladies in england is it not glorious
735073 not to me but to my friend sherlock holmes with all the will in the world i could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius as it was we very nearly lost it at the last moment
735074 pray sit down and tell me all about it dr watson
735075 i am all right again it was a shock to me to hear that i had placed my friends in such horrible peril
735076 it was nothing i will tell you no more gloomy details let us turn to something brighter there is the treasure what could be brighter than that i got leave to bring it with me thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it
735077 the box alone must be of some value where is the key
735078 where there is no money there is no pay this nights work would have been worth a tenner each to sam brown and me if the treasure had been there
735079 he will see that you are rewarded treasure or no
735080 yes i have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it
735081 it is my treasure and if i cant have the loot ill take darned good care that no one else does i tell you that no living man has any right to it unless it is three men who are in the andaman convict barracks and myself i know now that i cannot have the use of it and i know that they cannot i have acted all through for them as much as for myself its been the sign of four with us always well i know that they would have had me do just what i have done and throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of sholto or morstan it was not to make them rich that we did for achmet youll find the treasure where the key is and where little tonga is when i saw that your launch must catch us i put the loot away in a safe place there are no rupees for you this journey
735082 if you had wished to throw the treasure into the thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all
735083 easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover
735084 the man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river now that they are scattered over five miles or so it may be a harder job it went to my heart to do it though i was half mad when you came up with us however theres no good grieving over it ive had ups in my life and ive had downs but ive learned not to cry over spilled milk
735085 if you had helped justice instead of thwarting it in this way you would have had a better chance at your trial
735086 a pretty justice whose loot is this if it is not ours where is the justice that i should give it up to those who have never earned it look how i have earned it twenty long years in that fever ridden swamp all day at work under the mangrove tree all night chained up in the filthy convict huts bitten by mosquitoes racked with ague bullied by every cursed black faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man that was how i earned the agra treasure and you talk to me of justice because i cannot bear to feel that i have paid this price only that another may enjoy it i would rather swing a score of times or have one of tongas darts in my hide than live in a convicts cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine
735087 we have not heard your story and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side
735088 well sir you have been very fair spoken to me though i
735089 i wasnt destined to do much soldiering however i had
735090 i was as you can imagine pretty down on my luck at this
735091 well i was never in lucks way long suddenly without a
735092 as it proved however there was no great safety there
735093 the city of agra is a great place swarming with fanatics
735094 the river washes along the front of the old fort and so
735095 well i was pretty proud at having this small command given
735096 the third night of my watch was dark and dirty with a
735097 my first thought was that these fellows were in league with
735098 listen to me sahib said the taller and fiercer of the
735099 how can i decide said i you have not told me what you
735100 it is nothing against the fort said he we only ask
735101 but what is the treasure then i asked i am as ready
735102 you will swear then said he by the bones of your father
735103 i will swear it i answered provided that the fort is
735104 then my comrade and i will swear that you shall have a
735105 no dost akbar must have his share we can tell the tale
735106 there is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much
735107 in worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a
735108 consider sahib said he that if this man is taken by
735109 it is well he answered handing me back my firelock
735110 does your brother know then of what you will do i asked
735111 the plan is his he has devised it we will go to the
735112 the rain was still falling steadily for it was just the
735113 suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the
735114 an iron box he answered which contains one or two
735115 i could not trust myself to speak longer with the man the
735116 take him to the main guard said i the two sikhs closed
735117 i could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors suddenly it ceased and i heard voices and a scuffle with the sound of blows a moment later there came to my horror a rush of footsteps coming in my direction with the loud breathing of a running man i turned my lantern down the long straight passage and there was the fat man running like the wind with a smear of blood across his face and close at his heels bounding like a tiger the great black bearded sikh with a knife flashing in his hand i have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant he was gaining on the sikh and i could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet my heart softened to him but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter i cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit ere he could stagger to his feet the sikh was upon him and buried his knife twice in his side the man never uttered moan nor moved muscle but lay where he had fallen i think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall you see gentlemen that i am keeping my promise i am telling you every word of the business just exactly as it happened whether it is in my favor or not
735118 i should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains besides it was my life or his when once he was in the fort if he had got out the whole business would come to light and i should have been court martialled and shot as likely as not for people were not very lenient at a time like that
735119 well we carried him in abdullah akbar and i a fine
735120 it lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked
735121 after we had counted our treasures we put them back into
735122 well theres no use my telling you gentlemen what came of
735123 it came about in this way when the rajah put his jewels
735124 it was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in
735125 at last it seemed to me to have come i was changed from
735126 the surgeon dr somerton was a fast sporting young chap
735127 well there was one thing which very soon struck me and
735128 one night he lost even more heavily than usual i was
735129 its all up morstan he was saying as they passed my hut
735130 nonsense old chap said the other slapping him upon the
735131 well small what is it he asked taking his cheroot
735132 i wanted to ask you sir said i who is the proper
735133 half a million small he gasped looking hard at me to
735134 quite that sir in jewels and pearls it lies there
735135 you think then sir that i should give the information
735136 well well you must not do anything rash or that you
735137 i told him the whole story with small changes so that he
735138 this is a very important matter small he said at last
735139 two nights later he and his friend captain morstan came to
735140 i want you just to let captain morstan hear that story
735141 it rings true eh said he its good enough to act
735142 look here small said the major we have been talking
735143 why as to that gentlemen i answered trying also to be
735144 hum said he a fifth share that is not very tempting
735145 but how can we gain your freedom you know very well that
735146 nothing of the sort i answered i have thought it all
735147 none or all i answered we have sworn it the four of
735148 you see morstan said he small is a man of his word
735149 its a dirty business the other answered yet as you
735150 well small said the major we must i suppose try and
735151 not so fast said i growing colder as he got hot
735152 nonsense he broke in what have three black fellows to
735153 black or blue said i they are in with me and we all
735154 well the matter ended by a second meeting at which
735155 well gentlemen i weary you with my long story and i know
735156 well i have set my mind on many things in this life and
735157 tonga for that was his name was a fine boatman and
735158 he was stanch and true was little tonga no man ever had
735159 well if i were to tell you all the adventures that my
735160 one day however i got word that he was dying i hurried
735161 we earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor tonga
735162 i dont know that i have anything else to tell you i had heard a waterman speak of the speed of smiths launch the aurora so i thought she would be a handy craft for our escape i engaged with old smith and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship he knew no doubt that there was some screw loose but he was not in our secrets all this is the truth and if i tell it to you gentlemen it is not to amuse you for you have not done me a very good turn but it is because i believe the best defence i can make is just to hold back nothing but let all the world know how badly i have myself been served by major sholto and how innocent i am of the death of his son
735163 a fitting wind up to an extremely interesting case there is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative except that you brought your own rope that i did not know by the way i had hoped that tonga had lost all his darts yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat
735164 he had lost them all sir except the one which was in his blow pipe at the time
735165 is there any other point which you would like to ask about
735166 you are a man to be humored and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime but duty is duty and i have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me i shall feel more at ease when we have our story teller here safe under lock and key the cab still waits and there are two inspectors down stairs i am much obliged to you both for your assistance of course you will be wanted at the trial good night to you
735167 ill take particular care that you dont club me with your wooden leg whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the andaman isles
735168 well and there is the end of our little drama
735169 i fear that it may be the last investigation in which i shall have the chance of studying your methods miss morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective
735170 have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice
735171 not at all i think she is one of the most charming young ladies i ever met and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing she had a decided genius that way witness the way in which she preserved that agra plan from all the other papers of her father but love is an emotional thing and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which i place above all things i should never marry myself lest i bias my judgment
735172 that my judgment may survive the ordeal but you look weary
735173 yes the reaction is already upon me i shall be as limp as a rag for a week
735174 how terms of what in another man i should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor
735175 there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow i often think of those lines of old goethe schade dass die natur nur einen mensch aus dir schuf denn zum wurdigen mann war und zum schelmen der stoff 14 by the way a propos 15 of this norwood business you see that they had as i surmised a confederate in the house who could be none other than lal rao the butler so jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul
735176 you have done all the work in this business i get a wife out of it jones gets the credit pray what remains for you
735177 sensed a little hostility and a little arrogance and a little bit of condescension there and that was just my natural reaction
735178 to james mortimer m r c s from his friends of the c c h
735179 how did you know what i was doing i believe you have eyes in the back of your head
735180 i have at least a well polished silver plated coffee pot in front of me
735181 that dr mortimer is a successful elderly medical man well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation
735182 i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot
735183 because this stick though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it the thick iron ferrule is worn down so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it
735184 and then again there is the friends of the c c h i should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance and which has made him a small presentation in return
735185 i am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities it may be that you are not yourself luminous but you are a conductor of light some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it i confess my dear fellow that i am very much in your debt
735186 there are certainly one or two indications upon the stick it gives us the basis for several deductions
735187 i trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have overlooked
735188 i am afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusions were erroneous when i said that you stimulated me i meant to be frank that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth not that you are entirely wrong in this instance the man is certainly a country practitioner and he walks a good deal
735189 no no my dear watson not all by no means all i would suggest for example that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from an hospital than from a hunt and that when the initials c c are placed before that hospital the words charing cross very naturally suggest themselves
735190 the probability lies in that direction and if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor
735191 well then supposing that c c h does stand for charing cross hospital what further inferences may we draw
735192 do none suggest themselves you know my methods apply them
735193 i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country
735194 i think that we might venture a little farther than this look at it in this light on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made when would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will obviously at the moment when dr mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself we know there has been a presentation we believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice is it then stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change
735195 now you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital since only a man well established in a london practice could hold such a position and such a one would not drift into the country what was he then if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior student and he left five years ago the date is on the stick so your grave middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air my dear watson and there emerges a young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absent minded and the possessor of a favourite dog which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff
735196 as to the latter part i have no means of checking you
735197 but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the mans age and professional career
735198 mortimer james m r c s 1882 grimpen dartmoor devon house surgeon from 1882 to 1884 at charing cross hospital winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology with essay entitled is disease a reversion corresponding member of the swedish pathological society author of some freaks of atavism lancet 1882 do we progress journal of psychology march 1883 medical officer for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow
735199 but a country doctor as you very astutely observed i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences as to the adjectives i said if i remember right amiable unambitious and absent minded it is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials only an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country and only an absent minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting card after waiting an hour in your room
735200 has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible the dogs jaw as shown in the space between these marks is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff it may have been yes by jove it is a curly haired spaniel
735201 my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that
735202 for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very doorstep and there is the ring of its owner dont move i beg you watson he is a professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me now is the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life and you know not whether for good or ill what does dr james mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime come in
735203 i was not sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office i would not lose that stick for the world
735204 from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage
735205 only that you have disarranged our little deductions your marriage you say
735206 yes sir i married and so left the hospital and with it all hopes of a consulting practice it was necessary to make a home of my own
735207 come come we are not so far wrong after all
735208 a dabbler in science mr holmes a picker up of shells on
735209 glad to meet you sir i have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend you interest me very much mr holmes i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well marked supra orbital development would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure a cast of your skull sir until the original is available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum it is not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull
735210 you are an enthusiast in your line of thought i perceive sir as i am in mine
735211 i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes have no hesitation in lighting one
735212 that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again to day
735213 no sir no though i am happy to have had the opportunity
735214 indeed sir may i inquire who has the honour to be the first
735215 to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly
735216 i said sir to the precisely scientific mind but as a
735217 i think dr mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance
735218 you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject i put that at 1730
735219 this family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in devonshire i may say that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant he was a strong minded man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as i am myself yet he took this document very seriously and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him
735220 you will observe watson the alternative use of the long s and the short it is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date
735221 yes it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the baskerville family
735222 but i understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me
735223 most modern a most practical pressing matter which must be decided within twenty four hours but the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair with your permission i will read it to you
735224 of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have
735225 know then that in the time of the great rebellion the
735226 it chanced that some little time later hugo left his guests
735227 now for some space the revellers stood agape unable to
735228 they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
735229 the company had come to a halt more sober men as you may
735230 such is the tale my sons of the coming of the hound which
735231 this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john
735232 now mr holmes we will give you something a little more recent this is the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that date
735233 the facts of the case are simple sir charles baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall the evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom on the 4th of may sir charles had declared his intention of starting next day for london and had ordered barrymore to prepare his luggage that night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar he never returned at twelve oclock barrymore finding the hall door still open became alarmed and lighting a lantern went in search of his master the day had been wet and sir charless footmarks were easily traced down the alley half way down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor there were indications that sir charles had stood for some little time here he then proceeded down the alley and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered one fact which has not been explained is the statement of barrymore that his masters footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor gate and that he appeared from thence onwards to have been walking upon his toes one murphy a gipsy horse dealer was on the moor at no great distance at the time but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came no signs of violence were to be discovered upon sir charless person and though the doctors evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that dr mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea 2 and death from cardiac exhaustion this explanation was borne out by the post mortem examination which showed long standing organic disease and the coroners jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence it is well that this is so for it is obviously of the utmost importance that sir charless heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair it might have been difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall it is understood that the next of kin is mr henry baskerville if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskervilles younger brother the young man when last heard of was in america and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune
735234 those are the public facts mr holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville
735235 for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest i had observed some newspaper comment at the time but i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch with several interesting english cases this article you say contains all the public facts
735236 the moor is very sparsely inhabited and those who live
735237 within the last few months it became increasingly plain to
735238 i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening
735239 it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to
735240 on the night of sir charless death barrymore the butler who made the discovery sent perkins the groom on horseback to me and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event i checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest i followed the footsteps down the yew alley i saw the spot at the moor gate where he seemed to have waited i remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point i noted that there were no other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally i carefully examined the body which had not been touched until my arrival sir charles lay on his face his arms out his fingers dug into the ground and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn to his identity there was certainly no physical injury of any kind but one false statement was made by barrymore at the inquest he said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body he did not observe any but i did some little distance off but fresh and clear
735241 mr holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound
735242 the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought i dont suppose i should have done so had i not known this legend
735243 there are two lines of old yew hedge 12ft high and impenetrable the walk in the centre is about 8ft across
735244 yes there is a strip of grass about 6ft broad on either side
735245 i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate
735246 yes the wicket gate which leads on to the moor
735247 so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate
735248 there is an exit through a summer house at the far end
735249 now tell me dr mortimer and this is important the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass
735250 were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate
735251 yes they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor gate
735252 you interest me exceedingly another point was the wicket gate closed
735253 and what marks did you see by the wicket gate
735254 it was all very confused sir charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes
735255 excellent this is a colleague watson after our own heart but the marks
735256 he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel i could discern no others
735257 it is evidently a case of extraordinary interest and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert that gravel page upon which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants oh dr mortimer dr mortimer to think that you should not have called me in you have indeed much to answer for
735258 i could not call you in mr holmes without disclosing
735259 there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless
735260 since the tragedy mr holmes there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of nature
735261 i find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal known to science they all agreed that it was a huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral i have cross examined these men one of them a hard headed countryman one a farrier and one a moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly corresponding to the hell hound of the legend i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night
735262 and you a trained man of science believe it to be supernatural
735263 in a modest way i have combated evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious a task yet you must admit that the footmark is material
735264 the original hound was material enough to tug a mans throat out and yet he was diabolical as well
735265 i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists but now dr mortimer tell me this if you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate sir charless death and that you desire me to do it
735266 i did not say that i desired you to do it
735267 by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville who arrives at waterloo station
735268 yes on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada from the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of sir charless will
735269 none the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder the second brother who died young is the father of this lad henry the third rodger was the black sheep of the family he came of the old masterful baskerville strain and was the very image they tell me of the family picture of old hugo he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and died there in 1876 of yellow fever henry is the last of the baskervilles in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this morning now mr holmes what would you advise me to do with him
735270 why should he not go to the home of his fathers
735271 it seems natural does it not and yet consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate i feel sure that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place and yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak country side depends upon his presence all the good work which has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall i fear lest i should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that is why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice
735272 in your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an unsafe abode for a baskerville that is your opinion
735273 at least i might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so
735274 exactly but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing
735275 you put the matter more flippantly mr holmes than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things your advice then as i understand it is that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london he comes in fifty minutes what would you recommend
735276 i recommend sir that you take a cab call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville
735277 and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up my mind about the matter
735278 how long will it take you to make up your mind
735279 twenty four hours at ten oclock to morrow dr mortimer i will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you
735280 only one more question dr mortimer you say that before sir charles baskervilles death several people saw this apparition upon the moor
735281 no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid but this is splendid really unique from some points of view when you pass bradleys would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco thank you it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning
735282 i suppose it is pretty thick now that you mention it
735283 open the window then you have been at your club all day i perceive
735284 there is a delightful freshness about you watson which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense a gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day he returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots he has been a fixture therefore all day he is not a man with intimate friends where then could he have been is it not obvious
735285 the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes where do you think that i have been
735286 exactly my body has remained in this arm chair and has i regret to observe consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco after you left i sent down to stamfords for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit has hovered over it all day i flatter myself that i could find my way about
735287 here you have the particular district which concerns us that is baskerville hall in the middle
735288 exactly i fancy the yew alley though not marked under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you perceive upon the right of it this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr mortimer has his headquarters within a radius of five miles there are as you see only a very few scattered dwellings here is lafter hall which was mentioned in the narrative there is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton if i remember right was his name here are two moorland farmhouses high tor and foulmire then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown between and around these scattered points extends the desolate lifeless moor this then is the stage upon which tragedy has been played and upon which we may help to play it again
735289 yes the setting is a worthy one if the devil did desire
735290 the devils agents may be of flesh and blood may they not there are two questions waiting for us at the outset the one is whether any crime has been committed at all the second is what is the crime and how was it committed of course if dr mortimers surmise should be correct and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature there is an end of our investigation but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one i think well shut that window again if you dont mind it is a singular thing but i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think but that is the logical outcome of my convictions have you turned the case over in your mind
735291 yes i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day
735292 it has certainly a character of its own there are points of distinction about it that change in the footprints for example what do you make of that
735293 mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley
735294 he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley
735295 he was running watson running desperately running for his life running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face
735296 there lies our problem there are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run
735297 i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor if that were so and it seems most probable only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it if the gipsys evidence may be taken as true he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be then again whom was he waiting for that night and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house
735298 the man was elderly and infirm we can understand his taking an evening stroll but the ground was damp and the night inclement is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as dr mortimer with more practical sense than i should have given him credit for deduced from the cigar ash
735299 i think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every evening on the contrary the evidence is that he avoided the moor that night he waited there it was the night before he made his departure for london the thing takes shape watson it becomes coherent might i ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning
735300 and the strange thing is mr sherlock holmes that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning i should have come on my own i understand that you think out little puzzles and ive had one this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give to it
735301 pray take a seat sir henry do i understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london
735302 nothing of much importance mr holmes only a joke as like as not it was this letter if you can call it a letter which reached me this morning
735303 who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel
735304 no one could have known we only decided after i met dr mortimer
735305 there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel
735306 hum someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements
735307 as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor
735308 perhaps you will tell me mr holmes what in thunder is the meaning of that and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs
735309 what do you make of it dr mortimer you must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this at any rate
735310 no sir but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural
735311 it seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs
735312 you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry i promise you that
735313 we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening have you yesterdays times watson
735314 might i trouble you for it the inside page please with the leading articles
735315 capital article this on free trade permit me to give you an extract from it you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our imports and lower the general conditions of life in this island what do you think of that watson
735316 i dont know much about the tariff and things of that kind
735317 but it seems to me weve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned
735318 on the contrary i think we are particularly hot upon the trail sir henry watson here knows more about my methods than you do but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence
735319 and yet my dear watson there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other you your your life reason value keep away from the dont you see now whence these words have been taken
735320 if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that keep away and from the are cut out in one piece
735321 really mr holmes this exceeds anything which i could have imagined
735322 i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper but that you should name which and add that it came from the leading article is really one of the most remarkable things which i have ever known how did you do it
735323 i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimaux
735324 but this is my special hobby and the differences are equally obvious there is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a times article and the slovenly print of an evening halfpenny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimaux the detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime though i confess that once when i was very young i confused the leeds mercury with the western morning news but a times leader is entirely distinctive and these words could have been taken from nothing else as it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterdays issue
735325 so far as i can follow you then mr holmes
735326 that is so someone then cut out the message with a pair
735327 with gum on to the paper but i want to know why the word moor should have been written
735328 because he could not find it in print the other words were all simple and might be found in any issue but moor would be less common
735329 why of course that would explain it have you read anything else in this message mr holmes
735330 there are one or two indications and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues the address you observe is printed in rough characters but the times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated we may take it therefore that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known or come to be known by you again you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line but that some are much higher than others life for example is quite out of its proper place that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter on the whole i incline to the latter view since the matter was evidently important and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless if he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry since any letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel did the composer fear an interruption and from whom
735331 we are coming now rather into the region of guess work
735332 say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely it is the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculations now you would call it a guess no doubt but i am almost certain that this address has been written in an hotel
735333 if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble the pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address showing that there was very little ink in the bottle now a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state and the combination of the two must be quite rare but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get anything else yes i have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels round charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message halloa halloa whats this
735334 it is a blank half sheet of paper without even a watermark upon it i think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in london
735335 i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel
735336 we are coming to that you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter
735337 i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting
735338 i dont know much of british life yet for i have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada but i hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here
735339 it is only mislaid you will find it when you return to the hotel what is the use of troubling mr holmes with trifles of this kind
735340 well he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine
735341 however foolish the incident may seem you have lost one of your boots you say
735342 well mislaid it anyhow i put them both outside my door last night and there was only one in the morning i could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them the worst of it is that i only bought the pair last night in the strand and i have never had them on
735343 if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be cleaned
735344 they were tan boots and had never been varnished that was why i put them out
735345 then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots
735346 i did a good deal of shopping dr mortimer here went round with me you see if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways out west among other things i bought these brown boots gave six dollars for them and had one stolen before ever i had them on my feet
735347 i confess that i share dr mortimers belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found
735348 it seems to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at
735349 dr mortimer i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us
735350 well i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance
735351 of course ive heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery its the pet story of the family though i never thought of taking it seriously before but as to my uncles death well it all seems boiling up in my head and i cant get it clear yet you dont seem quite to have made up your mind whether its a case for a policeman or a clergyman
735352 and now theres this affair of the letter to me at the hotel i suppose that fits into its place
735353 it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor
735354 that someone is not ill disposed towards you since they warn you of danger
735355 or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away
735356 well of course that is possible also i am very much indebted to you dr mortimer for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall
735357 do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings
735358 which ever it is my answer is fixed there is no devil in hell mr holmes and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer
735359 i have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me its a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind now look here mr holmes its half past eleven now and i am going back right away to my hotel suppose you and your friend dr watson come round and lunch with us at two ill be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me
735360 then you may expect us shall i have a cab called
735361 id prefer to walk for this affair has flurried me rather
735362 then we meet again at two oclock au revoir and good morning
735363 your hat and boots watson quick not a moment to lose
735364 not for the world my dear watson i am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine our friends are wise for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk
735365 theres our man watson come along well have a good look at him if we can do no more
735366 was ever such bad luck and such bad management too watson watson if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes
735367 well it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen if they had followed him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the second you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the window while dr mortimer was reading his legend
735368 i was looking out for loiterers in the street but i saw none we are dealing with a clever man watson this matter cuts very deep and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us i am conscious always of power and design when our friends left i at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant so wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them it has however one obvious disadvantage
735369 my dear watson clumsy as i have been you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number 2704 is our man but that is no use to us for the moment
735370 i fail to see how you could have done more
735371 on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction i should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for as it is by an indiscreet eagerness which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man
735372 the shadow has departed and will not return we must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision could you swear to that mans face within the cab
735373 and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it was a false one a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features come in here watson
735374 ah wilson i see you have not forgotten the little case in which i had the good fortune to help you
735375 no sir indeed i have not you saved my good name and perhaps my life
735376 my dear fellow you exaggerate i have some recollection wilson that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright who showed some ability during the investigation
735377 could you ring him up thank you and i should be glad to have change of this five pound note
735378 thank you now cartwright there are the names of twenty three hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross do you see
735379 you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling here are twenty three shillings
735380 you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday you will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it you understand
735381 but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the times with some holes cut in it with scissors here is a copy of the times it is this page you could easily recognise it could you not
735382 in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give a shilling here are twenty three shillings you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the times among it the odds are enormously against your finding it there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies let me have a report by wire at baker street before evening and now watson it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no 2704 and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel
735383 he asked me to show you up at once when you came
735384 have you any objection to my looking at your register
735385 surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know
735386 a lawyer is he not grey headed and walks with a limp
735387 no sir this is mr johnson the coal owner a very active gentleman not older than yourself
735388 no sir he has used this hotel for many years and he is very well known to us
735389 ah that settles it mrs oldmore too i seem to remember the name excuse my curiosity but often in calling upon one friend one finds another
735390 she is an invalid lady sir her husband was once mayor of gloucester she always comes to us when she is in town
735391 thank you i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance we have established a most important fact by these questions watson
735392 we know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel that means that while they are as we have seen very anxious to watch him they are equally anxious that he should not see them now this is a most suggestive fact
735393 it suggests halloa my dear fellow what on earth is the matter
735394 seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel
735395 theyll find theyve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful by thunder if that chap cant find my missing boot there will be trouble i can take a joke with the best mr holmes but theyve got a bit over the mark this time
735396 but surely you said that it was a new brown boot
735397 so it was sir and now its an old black one
735398 thats just what i do mean to say i only had three pairs in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leathers which i am wearing last night they took one of my brown ones and to day they have sneaked one of the black well have you got it speak out man and dont stand staring
735399 no sir i have made inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it
735400 well either that boot comes back before sundown or ill see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel
735401 it shall be found sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found
735402 mind it is for its the last thing of mine that ill lose
735403 i just dont attempt to explain it it seems the very maddest queerest thing that ever happened to me
735404 well i dont profess to understand it yet this case of yours is very complex sir henry when taken in conjunction with your uncles death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts so deep but we hold several threads in our hands and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth we may waste time in following the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right
735405 i think that your decision is a wise one i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be if their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you did not know dr mortimer that you were followed this morning from my house
735406 that unfortunately is what i cannot tell you have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a black full beard
735407 no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charless butler is a man with a full black beard
735408 we had best ascertain if he is really there or if by any possibility he might be in london
735409 give me a telegraph form is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall which is the nearest telegraph office grimpen very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr barrymore to be delivered into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not
735410 by the way dr mortimer who is this barrymore anyhow
735411 he is the son of the old caretaker who is dead they have looked after the hall for four generations now so far as i know he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county
735412 its clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do
735413 yes sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will
735414 that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir charles for i also had a thousand pounds left to me
735415 there were many insignificant sums to individuals and a large number of public charities the residue all went to sir henry
735416 i had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved
735417 sir charles had the reputation of being rich but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities the total value of the estate was close on to a million
735418 dear me it is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game and one more question dr mortimer supposing that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate
735419 since rodger baskerville sir charless younger brother died unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who are distant cousins james desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmorland
735420 thank you these details are all of great interest have you met mr james desmond
735421 yes he once came down to visit sir charles he is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refused to accept any settlement from sir charles though he pressed it upon him
735422 and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charless thousands
735423 he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed he would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he likes with it
735424 no mr holmes i have not ive had no time for it was only yesterday that i learned how matters stood but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate that was my poor uncles idea how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property house land and dollars must go together
735425 quite so well sir henry i am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay there is only one provision which i must make you certainly must not go alone
735426 but dr mortimer has his practice to attend to and his house is miles away from yours with all the good will in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be always by your side
735427 is it possible that you could come yourself mr holmes
735428 if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present instant one of the most revered names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor
735429 if my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place no one can say so more confidently than i
735430 well now that is real kind of you dr watson
735431 you see how it is with me and you know just as much about the matter as i do if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through ill never forget it
735432 i do not know how i could employ my time better
735433 when a crisis comes as it will do i will direct how you shall act i suppose that by saturday all might be ready
735434 then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the 10 30 train from paddington
735435 in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching
735436 have just heard that barrymore is at the hall baskerville
735437 visited twenty three hotels as directed but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of times cartwright
735438 there go two of my threads watson there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you we must cast round for another scent
735439 exactly i have wired to get his name and address from the official registry i should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question
735440 i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for 2 704
735441 ive driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint i came here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had against me
735442 i have nothing in the world against you my good man
735443 on the contrary i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions
735444 first of all your name and address in case i want you again
735445 john clayton 3 turpey street the borough my cab is out of shipleys yard near waterloo station
735446 now clayton tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten oclock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down regent street
735447 why theres no good my telling you things for you seem to know as much as i do already
735448 the truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him to anyone
735449 my good fellow this is a very serious business and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me you say that your fare told you that he was a detective
735450 oh he mentioned his name did he that was imprudent what was the name that he mentioned
735451 i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own he got home upon me very prettily that time so his name was sherlock holmes was it
735452 excellent tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred
735453 he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square he said that he was a detective and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions i was glad enough to agree first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here
735454 well i couldnt be sure of that but i daresay my fare
735455 until we got three quarters down regent street then my gentleman threw up the trap and he cried that i should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go i whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes then he paid up his two guineas like a good one and away he went into the station only just as he was leaving he turned round and said it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr sherlock holmes thats how i come to know the name
735456 well he wasnt altogether such an easy gentleman to describe id put him at forty years of age and he was of a middle height two or three inches shorter than you sir he was dressed like a toff and he had a black beard cut square at the end and a pale face i dont know as i could say more than that
735457 well then here is your half sovereign theres another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information good night
735458 snap goes our third thread and we end where we began
735459 the cunning rascal he knew our number knew that sir henry baskerville had consulted me spotted who i was in regent street conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver and so sent back this audacious message i tell you watson this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel ive been checkmated in london i can only wish you better luck in devonshire but im not easy in my mind about it
735460 about sending you its an ugly business watson an ugly dangerous business and the more i see of it the less i like it yes my dear fellow you may laugh but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more
735461 i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions watson
735462 i wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorizing
735463 anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case and especially the relations between young baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of sir charles i have made some inquiries myself in the last few days but the results have i fear been negative one thing only appears to be certain and that is that mr james desmond who is the next heir is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution does not arise from him i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor
735464 would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore couple
735465 by no means you could not make a greater mistake if they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspects then there is a groom at the hall if i remember right there are two moorland farmers there is our friend dr mortimer whom i believe to be entirely honest and there is his wife of whom we know nothing there is this naturalist stapleton and there is his sister who is said to be a young lady of attractions there is mr frankland of lafter hall who is also an unknown factor and there are one or two other neighbours these are the folk who must be your very special study
735466 most certainly keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions
735467 i can swear to one thing and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days we have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch and no one could have escaped our notice
735468 except yesterday afternoon i usually give up one day to pure amusement when i come to town so i spent it at the museum of the college of surgeons
735469 and i went to look at the folk in the park
735470 i beg sir henry that you will not go about alone some great misfortune will befall you if you do did you get your other boot
735471 bear in mind sir henry one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted
735472 ive been over a good part of the world since i left it dr watson
735473 but i have never seen a place to compare with it
735474 i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county
735475 it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county
735476 a glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the celt which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment poor sir charless head was of a very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics but you were very young when you last saw baskerville hall were you not
735477 i was a boy in my teens at the time of my fathers death and had never seen the hall for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast thence i went straight to a friend in america i tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr watson and im as keen as possible to see the moor
735478 are you then your wish is easily granted for there is your first sight of the moor
735479 theres a convict escaped from princetown sir hes been out three days now and the warders watch every road and every station but theyve had no sight of him yet the farmers about here dont like it sir and thats a fact
735480 well i understand that they get five pounds if they can give information
735481 yes sir but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut you see it isnt like any ordinary convict this is a man that would stick at nothing
735482 no no the yew alley is on the other side
735483 its no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this
735484 its enough to scare any man ill have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you wont know it again with a thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall door
735485 no i must go i shall probably find some work awaiting me i would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be a better guide than i good bye and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service
735486 is it not the very picture of an old family home to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived it strikes me solemn to think of it
735487 would you wish dinner to be served at once sir
735488 in a very few minutes sir you will find hot water in your rooms my wife and i will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff
735489 i only meant sir that sir charles led a very retired life and we were able to look after his wants you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need changes in your household
735490 do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave
735491 but your family have been with us for several generations have they not i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection
735492 i feel that also sir and so does my wife but to tell the truth sir we were both very much attached to sir charles and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us i fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at baskerville hall
735493 i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business sir charless generosity has given us the means to do so and now sir perhaps i had best show you to your rooms
735494 i suppose one can tone down to it but i feel a bit out of the picture at present i dont wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this however if it suits you we will retire early to night and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning
735495 i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame
735496 we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive so we took a grey view of the place now we are fresh and well so it is all cheerful once more
735497 and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination
735498 did you for example happen to hear someone a woman i think sobbing in the night
735499 that is curious for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i heard something of the sort i waited quite a time but there was no more of it so i concluded that it was all a dream
735500 i heard it distinctly and i am sure that it was really the sob of a woman
735501 there are only two women in the house sir henry
735502 one is the scullery maid who sleeps in the other wing the other is my wife and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her
735503 i had the telegram delivered to mr barrymore exactly as directed
735504 my boy here james you delivered that telegram to mr barrymore at the hall last week did you not
735505 well he was up in the loft at the time so that i could not put it into his own hands but i gave it into mrs barrymores hands and she promised to deliver it at once
735506 no sir i tell you he was in the loft
735507 if you didnt see him how do you know he was in the loft
735508 well surely his own wife ought to know where he is
735509 didnt he get the telegram if there is any mistake it is for mr barrymore himself to complain
735510 you will i am sure excuse my presumption dr watson
735511 here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions you may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend mortimer i am stapleton of merripit house
735512 your net and box would have told me as much
735513 for i knew that mr stapleton was a naturalist but how did you know me
735514 i have been calling on mortimer and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed as our road lay the same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his journey
735515 we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here it is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind but i need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the country side sir henry has i suppose no superstitious fears in the matter
735516 of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family
735517 it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor
735518 the story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end
735519 his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart i fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley i feared that some disaster might occur for i was very fond of the old man and i knew that his heart was weak
735520 you think then that some dog pursued sir charles and that he died of fright in consequence
735521 it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr watson
735522 the records of your detective have reached us here and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity if you are here then it follows that mr sherlock holmes is interesting himself in the matter and i am naturally curious to know what view he may take
735523 may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself
735524 he cannot leave town at present he has other cases which engage his attention
735525 what a pity he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us but as to your own researches if there is any possible way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will command me if i had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice
735526 i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend sir henry and that i need no help of any kind
735527 you are perfectly right to be wary and discreet i am justly reproved for what i feel was an unjustifiable intrusion and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again
735528 a moderate walk along this moor path brings us to merripit house
735529 perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister
735530 you never tire of the moor you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains it is so vast and so barren and so mysterious
735531 i have only been here two years the residents would call me a new comer we came shortly after sir charles settled but my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round and i should think that there are few men who know it better than i do
735532 very hard you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it do you observe anything remarkable about that
735533 you would naturally think so and the thought has cost folk their lives before now you notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it
735534 a false step yonder means death to man or beast only yesterday i saw one of the moor ponies wander into it he never came out i saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog hole but it sucked him down at last even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it but after these autumn rains it is an awful place and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive by george there is another of those miserable ponies
735535 the mire has him two in two days and many more perhaps for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutch its a bad place the great grimpen mire
735536 yes there are one or two paths which a very active man can take i have found them out
735537 but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place
735538 well you see the hills beyond they are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire which has crawled round them in the course of years that is where the rare plants and the butterflies are if you have the wit to reach them
735539 for gods sake put such an idea out of your mind
735540 your blood would be upon my head i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that i am able to do it
735541 the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for its prey ive heard it once or twice before but never quite so loud
735542 you are an educated man you dont believe such nonsense as that
735543 what do you think is the cause of so strange a sound
735544 bogs make queer noises sometimes its the mud settling or the water rising or something
735545 well perhaps it was did you ever hear a bittern booming
735546 its a very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all things are possible upon the moor yes i should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns
735547 its the weirdest strangest thing that ever i heard in my life
735548 yes its rather an uncanny place altogether look at the hill side yonder what do you make of those
735549 no they are the homes of our worthy ancestors prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor and as no one in particular has lived there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them these are his wigwams with the roofs off you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside
735550 but it is quite a town when was it inhabited
735551 he grazed his cattle on these slopes and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe look at the great trench in the opposite hill that is his mark yes you will find some very singular points about the moor dr watson oh excuse me an instant it is surely cyclopides
735552 but for gods sake do what i ask you go back and never set foot upon the moor again
735553 can you not tell when a warning is for your own good go back to london start to night get away from this place at all costs hush my brother is coming not a word of what i have said would you mind getting that orchid for me among the yonder we are very rich in orchids on the moor though of course you are rather late to see the beauties of the place
735554 yes i was chasing a cyclopides he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn what a pity that i should have missed him
735555 yes i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor
735556 only a humble commoner but his friend my name is dr watson
735557 i talked as if dr watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor
735558 it cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids but you will come on will you not and see merripit house
735559 and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl
735560 it was in the north country the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of living with youth of helping to mould those young minds and of impressing them with ones own character and ideals was very dear to me however the fates were against us a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died it never recovered from the blow and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up and yet if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys i could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong tastes for botany and zoology i find an unlimited field of work here and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am all this dr watson has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window
735561 it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister
735562 we have books we have our studies and we have interesting neighbours dr mortimer is a most learned man in his own line poor sir charles was also an admirable companion we knew him well and miss him more than i can tell do you think that i should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry
735563 then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so we may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings will you come upstairs dr watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera i think it is the most complete one in the south west of england by the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready
735564 i have run all the way in order to cut you off dr watson
735565 i had not even time to put on my hat i must not stop or my brother may miss me i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir henry please forget the words i said which have no application whatever to you
735566 i am sir henrys friend and his welfare is a very close concern of mine tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should return to london
735567 a womans whim dr watson when you know me better you will understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or do
735568 no no i remember the thrill in your voice i remember the look in your eyes please please be frank with me miss stapleton for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me life has become like that great grimpen mire with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track tell me then what it was that you meant and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry
735569 my brother and i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles we knew him very intimately for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over his family and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed i was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here and i felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run that was all which i intended to convey
735570 but i do if you have any influence with sir henry take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family the world is wide why should he wish to live at the place of danger
735571 because it is the place of danger that is sir henrys nature i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move
735572 i cannot say anything definite for i do not know anything definite
735573 i would ask you one more question miss stapleton if you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said there is nothing to which he or anyone else could object
735574 my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited for he thinks that it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor he would be very angry if he knew that i had said anything which might induce sir henry to go away but i have done my duty now and i will say no more i must get back or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you good bye
735575 i was in the box room at the time and my wife brought it up to me
735576 no i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it
735577 i could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning sir henry
735578 i trust that they do not mean that i have done anything to forfeit your confidence
735579 i knew that barrymore walked about nights and i had a mind to speak to him about it
735580 two or three times i have heard his steps in the passage coming and going just about the hour you name
735581 perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window
735582 perhaps he does if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he were here
735583 i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest
735584 the man is rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that well sit up in my room to night and wait until he passes
735585 that depends on whether you are going on the moor
735586 well you know what my instructions are i am sorry to intrude but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor
735587 holmes with all his wisdom did not foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the moor you understand me i am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport i must go out alone
735588 you dont mean to say that you came after me in spite of all
735589 you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private
735590 but by thunder the whole country side seems to have been out to see me do my wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that where had you engaged a seat
735591 quite in the back row eh but her brother was well up to the front did you see him come out on us
735592 did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers
735593 i daresay not i always thought him sane enough until to day but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a strait jacket whats the matter with me anyhow youve lived near me for some weeks watson tell me straight now is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that i loved
735594 he cant object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he has this down on what has he against me i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers
735595 that and a deal more i tell you watson ive only known her these few weeks but from the first i just felt that she was made for me and she too she was happy when she was with me and that ill swear theres a light in a womans eyes that speaks louder than words but he has never let us get together and it was only to day for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few words with her alone she was glad to meet me but when she did it was not love that she would talk about and she wouldnt have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it she kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i had left it i told her that since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it and that if she really wanted me to go the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me with that i offered in as many words to marry her but before she could answer down came this brother of hers running at us with a face on him like a madman he was just white with rage and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury what was i doing with the lady how dared i offer her attentions which were distasteful to her did i think that because i was a baronet i could do what i liked if he had not been her brother i should have known better how to answer him as it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as i was not ashamed of and that i hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife that seemed to make the matter no better so then i lost my temper too and i answered him rather more hotly than i should perhaps considering that she was standing by so it ended by his going off with her as you saw and here am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county just tell me what it all means watson and ill owe you more than ever i can hope to pay
735596 i dont say now that he isnt a crazy man
735597 i cant forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done
735598 his sister is everything in his life he says that is natural enough and i am glad that he should understand her value they have always been together and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him he had not understood he said that i was becoming attached to her but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so and that she might be taken away from him it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did he was very sorry for all that had passed and he recognised how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the ladys friendship during that time without claiming her love this i promised and so the matter rests
735599 it was the window sir i go round at night to see that they are fastened
735600 we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later come now no lies what were you doing at that window
735601 i was doing no harm sir i was holding a candle to the window
735602 and why were you holding a candle to the window
735603 dont ask me sir henry dont ask me i give you my word sir that it is not my secret and that i cannot tell it if it concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you
735604 see the other moves also now you rascal do you deny that it is a signal come speak up who is your confederate out yonder and what is this conspiracy that is going on
735605 it is my business and not yours i will not tell
735606 and you go in disgrace by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me
735607 we have to go eliza this is the end of it you can pack our things
735608 oh john john have i brought you to this it is my doing sir henry all mine he has done nothing except for my sake and because i asked him
735609 my unhappy brother is starving on the moor we cannot let him perish at our very gates the light is a signal to him that food is ready for him and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it
735610 i said that it was not my secret and that i could not tell it to you but now you have heard it and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you
735611 yes sir my name was selden and he is my younger brother we humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure and that he could do what he liked in it then as he grew older he met wicked companions and the devil entered into him until he broke my mothers heart and dragged our name in the dirt from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold but to me sir he was always the little curly headed boy that i had nursed and played with as an elder sister would that was why he broke prison sir he knew that i was here and that we could not refuse to help him when he dragged himself here one night weary and starving with the warders hard at his heels what could we do we took him in and fed him and cared for him then you returned sir and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over so he lay in hiding there but every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him every day we hoped that he was gone but as long as he was there we could not desert him that is the whole truth as i am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he has done all that he has
735612 well i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife forget what i have said go to your room you two and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning
735613 it may be so placed as to be only visible from here
735614 well it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to it and he is waiting this villain beside that candle by thunder watson i am going out to take that man
735615 then get your revolver and put on your boots the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his light and be off
735616 we must close in on him rapidly for he is said to be a desperate fellow we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist
735617 what would holmes say to this how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted
735618 i dont know its a sound they have on the moor i heard it once before
735619 oh they are ignorant people why should you mind what they call it
735620 they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles
735621 but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder i think
735622 it rose and fell with the wind isnt that the direction of the great grimpen mire
735623 well it was up there come now watson didnt you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound i am not a child you need not fear to speak the truth
735624 stapleton was with me when i heard it last he said that it might be the calling of a strange bird
735625 no no it was a hound my god can there be some truth in all these stories is it possible that i am really in danger from so dark a cause you dont believe it do you watson
735626 and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that and my uncle there was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay it all fits together i dont think that i am a coward watson but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood feel my hand
735627 i dont think ill get that cry out of my head what do you advise that we do now
735628 no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it we after the convict and a hell hound as likely as not after us come on well see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor
735629 wait here he must be near his light let us see if we can get a glimpse of him
735630 the moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped
735631 he thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he of his own free will had told us the secret
735632 and if i have i am sure that i beg your pardon at the same time i was very much surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing selden the poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track
735633 if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing
735634 you only told us or rather your wife only told us when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself
735635 i didnt think you would have taken advantage of it sir henry indeed i didnt
735636 the man is a public danger there are lonely houses scattered over the moor and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing you only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that look at mr stapletons house for example with no one but himself to defend it theres no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key
735637 hell break into no house sir i give you my solemn word upon that but he will never trouble anyone in this country again i assure you sir henry that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to south america for gods sake sir i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor they have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him you cant tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble i beg you sir to say nothing to the police
735638 if he were safely out of the country it would relieve the taxpayer of a burden
735639 but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes
735640 he would not do anything so mad sir we have provided him with all that he can want to commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding
735641 god bless you sir and thank you from my heart it would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again
735642 i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony watson but after what we have heard i dont feel as if i could give the man up so there is an end of it all right barrymore you can go
735643 youve been so kind to us sir that i should like to do the best i can for you in return i know something sir henry and perhaps i should have said it before but it was long after the inquest that i found it out ive never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man its about poor sir charless death
735644 i know why he was at the gate at that hour it was to meet a woman
735645 i cant give you the name sir but i can give you the initials her initials were l l
735646 well sir henry your uncle had a letter that morning he had usually a great many letters for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him but that morning as it chanced there was only this one letter so i took the more notice of it it was from coombe tracey and it was addressed in a womans hand
735647 well sir i thought no more of the matter and never would have done had it not been for my wife only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charless study it had never been touched since his death and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate the greater part of it was charred to pieces but one little slip the end of a page hung together and the writing could still be read though it was grey on a black ground it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said please please as you are a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten oclock beneath it were signed the initials l l
735648 no sir it crumbled all to bits after we moved it
735649 had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing
735650 well sir i took no particular notice of his letters i should not have noticed this one only it happened to come alone
735651 no sir no more than you have but i expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charless death
735652 i cannot understand barrymore how you came to conceal this important information
735653 well sir it was immediately after that our own trouble
735654 well sir i thought no good could come of it but now you have been kind to us and i feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter
735655 well watson what do you think of this new light
735656 it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before
735657 so i think but if we can only trace l l it should clear up the whole business we have gained that much we know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her what do you think we should do
735658 let holmes know all about it at once it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking i am much mistaken if it does not bring him down
735659 i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know
735660 can you then tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l l
735661 there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom i cant answer but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those wait a bit though
735662 there is laura lyons her initials are l l but she lives in coombe tracey
735663 exactly she married an artist named lyons who came sketching on the moor he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her the fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well so between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time
735664 i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance but it cannot be more for his own affairs are considerably involved whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad her story got about and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living stapleton did for one and sir charles for another i gave a trifle myself it was to set her up in a typewriting business
735665 has this precious relation of yours departed or is he still lurking out yonder
735666 i dont know sir i hope to heaven that he has gone for he has brought nothing but trouble here ive not heard of him since i left out food for him last and that was three days ago
735667 no sir but the food was gone when next i went that way
735668 so you would think sir unless it was the other man who took it
735669 selden told me of him sir a week ago or more hes in hiding too but hes not a convict so far as i can make out i dont like it dr watson i tell you straight sir that i dont like it
735670 now listen to me barrymore i have no interest in this matter but that of your master i have come here with no object except to help him tell me frankly what it is that you dont like
735671 theres foul play somewhere and theres black villainy brewing to that ill swear very glad i should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again
735672 look at sir charless death that was bad enough for all that the coroner said look at the noises on the moor at night theres not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it look at this stranger hiding out yonder and watching and waiting whats he waiting for what does it mean it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henrys new servants are ready to take over the hall
735673 can you tell me anything about him what did selden say did he find out where he hid or what he was doing
735674 he saw him once or twice but he is a deep one and gives nothing away at first he thought that he was the police but soon he found that he had some lay of his own a kind of gentleman he was as far as he could see but what he was doing he could not make out
735675 among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the old folk used to live
735676 selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings him all he needs i daresay he goes to coombe tracey for what he wants
735677 very good barrymore we may talk further of this some other time
735678 there is nothing in common between my father and me
735679 i owe him nothing and his friends are not mine if it were not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i might have starved for all that my father cared
735680 it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to see you
735681 i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness if i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation
735682 the object is to avoid a public scandal it is better that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control
735683 i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity
735684 yes once or twice when he came into coombe tracey he was a very retiring man and he preferred to do good by stealth
735685 but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he has done
735686 there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me one was mr stapleton a neighbour and intimate friend of sir charles he was exceedingly kind and it was through him that sir charles learned about my affairs
735687 did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you
735688 you do sir charles an injustice he did burn the letter but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned you acknowledge now that you wrote it
735689 i did write it why should i deny it i have no reason to be ashamed of it i wished him to help me i believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help so i asked him to meet me
735690 because i had only just learned that he was going to london next day and might be away for months there were reasons why i could not get there earlier
735691 but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house
735692 do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelors house
735693 no i swear it to you on all i hold sacred i never went something intervened to prevent my going
735694 you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death but you deny that you kept the appointment
735695 you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised if your position is innocent why did you in the first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that date
735696 because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal
735697 and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy your letter
735698 i did not say that i had read all the letter
735699 i quoted the postscript the letter had as i said been burned and it was not all legible i ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death
735700 the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation
735701 i will tell you then if you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it
735702 my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor the law is upon his side and every day i am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met it meant everything to me peace of mind happiness self respect everything i knew sir charless generosity and i thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me
735703 because i received help in the interval from another source
735704 why then did you not write to sir charles and explain this
735705 so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next morning
735706 you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me
735707 it is a great day for me sir one of the red letter days of my life
735708 i have brought off a double event i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it i have established a right of way through the centre of old middletons park slap across it sir within a hundred yards of his own front door what do you think of that well teach these magnates that they cannot ride rough shod over the rights of the commoners confound them and ive closed the wood where the fernworthy folk used to picnic these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles both cases decided dr watson and both in my favour i havent had such a day since i had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren
735709 look it up in the books sir it will repay reading frankland v morland court of queens bench it cost me l 200 7 but i got my verdict
735710 none sir none i am proud to say that i had no interest in the matter i act entirely from a sense of public duty i have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to night i told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions the county constabulary is in a scandalous state sir and it has not afforded me the protection to which i am entitled the case of frankland v regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public i told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my words have come true
735711 because i could tell them what they are dying to know but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way
735712 ha ha my boy a very much more important matter than that what about the convict on the moor
735713 i may not know exactly where he is but i am quite sure that i could help the police to lay their hands on him has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him
735714 but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor
735715 i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food
735716 youll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof he passes along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be going except to the convict
735717 i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his fathers dinner
735718 do you see that black tor over yonder well do you see the low hill beyond with the thorn bush upon it it is the stoniest part of the whole moor is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station your suggestion sir is a most absurd one
735719 you may be sure sir that i have very good grounds before i come to an opinion i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle every day and sometimes twice a day i have been able but wait a moment dr watson do my eyes deceive me or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside
735720 you will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself
735721 quick dr watson quick before he passes over the hill
735722 certainly there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand
735723 and what the errand is even a county constable could guess but not one word shall they have from me and i bind you to secrecy also dr watson not a word you understand
735724 they have treated me shamefully shamefully when the facts come out in frankland v regina i venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country nothing would induce me to help the police in any way for all they cared it might have been me instead of my effigy which these rascals burned at the stake surely you are not going you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion
735725 i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in
735726 i never was more glad to see anyone in my life
735727 the surprise was not all on one side i assure you i had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat still less that you were inside it until i was within twenty paces of the door
735728 no watson i fear that i could not undertake to recognise your footprint amid all the footprints of the world if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley oxford street i know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood you will see it there beside the path you threw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut
735729 i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was convinced that you were sitting in ambush a weapon within reach waiting for the tenant to return so you actually thought that i was the criminal
735730 i did not know who you were but i was determined to find out
735731 excellent watson and how did you localize me you saw me perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when i was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me
735732 and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one
735733 no your boy had been observed and that gave me a guide where to look
735734 the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt i could not make it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens
735735 ha i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies whats this paper so you have been to coombe tracey have you
735736 well done our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines and when we unite our results i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case
735737 well i am glad from my heart that you are here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves but how in the name of wonder did you come here and what have you been doing i thought that you were in baker street working out that case of blackmailing
735738 then you use me and yet do not trust me
735739 i think that i have deserved better at your hands holmes
735740 my dear fellow you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seemed to play a trick upon you in truth it was partly for your own sake that i did it and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself had i been with sir henry and you it is evident that my point of view would have been the same as yours and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard as it is i have been able to get about as i could not possibly have done had i been living at the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment
735741 for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery you would have wished to tell me something or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run i brought cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the express office and he has seen after my simple wants a loaf of bread and a clean collar what does man want more he has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet and both have been invaluable
735742 here are your reports my dear fellow and very well thumbed i assure you i made excellent arrangements and they are only delayed one day upon their way i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case
735743 and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs laura lyons it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone for i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter in fact if you had not gone to day it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone to morrow
735744 it fills up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair you are aware perhaps that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man stapleton
735745 there can be no doubt about the matter they meet they
735746 i am giving you some information now in return for all that you have given me the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is in reality his wife
735747 good heavens holmes are you sure of what you say how could he have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her
735748 sir henrys falling in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry he took particular care that sir henry did not make love to her as you have yourself observed i repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister
735749 because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman
735750 it is he then who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in london
735751 but are you sure of this holmes how do you know that the woman is his wife
735752 because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you and i daresay he has many a time regretted it since he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england now there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster there are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the man who had owned it the name was different had disappeared with his wife the descriptions agreed when i learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete
735753 if this woman is in truth his wife where does mrs laura lyons come in
735754 that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband in that case regarding stapleton as an unmarried man she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife
735755 why then we may find the lady of service it must be our first duty to see her both of us to morrow dont you think watson that you are away from your charge rather long your place should be at baskerville hall
735756 surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me what is the meaning of it all what is he after
735757 it is murder watson refined cold blooded deliberate murder do not ask me for particulars my nets are closing upon him even as his are upon sir henry and with your help he is already almost at my mercy there is but one danger which can threaten us it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so another day two at the most and i have my case complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child your mission to day has justified itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side hark
735758 come watson come great heavens if we are too late
735759 fool that i was to hold my hand and you watson see what comes of abandoning your charge but by heaven if the worst has happened well avenge him
735760 oh holmes i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate
735761 i am more to blame than you watson in order to have my case well rounded and complete i have thrown away the life of my client it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career but how could i know how could i know that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings
735762 that we should have heard his screams my god those screams and yet have been unable to save him where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant and stapleton where is he he shall answer for this deed
735763 he shall i will see to that uncle and nephew have been murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast save from what we heard we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry has evidently died from the fall but by heavens cunning as he is the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past
735764 our case is not complete the fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree it is not what we know but what we can prove if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet
735765 there will be plenty for us to do to morrow to night we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend
735766 we must send for help holmes we cannot carry him all the way to the hall good heavens are you mad
735767 it is not the baronet it is why it is my neighbour the convict
735768 it is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of sir henrys the boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all probability and so ran this man down there is one very singular thing however how came selden in the darkness to know that the hound was on his trail
735769 to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help by his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track how did he know
735770 a greater mystery to me is why this hound presuming that
735771 well then why this hound should be loose to night i suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would be there
735772 my difficulty is the more formidable of the two for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain for ever a mystery the question now is what shall we do with this poor wretchs body we cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens
735773 i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police
735774 exactly i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far halloa watson whats this its the man himself by all thats wonderful and audacious not a word to show your suspicions not a word or my plans crumble to the ground
735775 why dr watson thats not you is it you are the last man that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night but dear me whats this somebody hurt not dont tell me that it is our friend sir henry
735776 dear me what a very shocking affair how did he die
735777 he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry
735778 i heard a cry also that was what brought me out i was uneasy about sir henry
735779 because i had suggested that he should come over when he did not come i was surprised and i naturally became alarmed for his safety when i heard cries upon the moor by the way
735780 oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound and so on it is said to be heard at night upon the moor i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to night
735781 and what is your theory of this poor fellows death
735782 i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck
735783 we have been expecting you in these parts since dr watson came down you are in time to see a tragedy
735784 yes indeed i have no doubt that my friends explanation will cover the facts i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me to morrow
735785 i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us
735786 one cannot always have the success for which one hopes an investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours it has not been a satisfactory case
735787 i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in doing it i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning
735788 what a nerve the fellow has how he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot i told you in london watson and i tell you now again that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel
735789 and so was i at first but there was no getting out of it
735790 what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here
735791 it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measures at once like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us
735792 my dear watson you were born to be a man of action your instinct is always to do something energetic but supposing for arguments sake that we had him arrested to night what on earth the better off should we be for that we could prove nothing against him theres the devilish cunning of it if he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master
735793 not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture we should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence
735794 found dead without a mark upon him you and i know that he died of sheer fright and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it what signs are there of a hound where are the marks of its fangs of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him but we have to prove all this and we are not in a position to do it
735795 we are not much better off to night again there was no direct connection between the hound and the mans death we never saw the hound we heard it but we could not prove that it was running upon this mans trail there is a complete absence of motive no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one
735796 i have great hopes of what mrs laura lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her and i have my own plan as well sufficient for to morrow is the evil thereof but i hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last
735797 yes i see no reason for further concealment but one last word watson say nothing of the hound to sir henry let him think that seldens death was as stapleton would have us believe he will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to morrow when he is engaged if i remember your report aright to dine with these people
735798 then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone that will be easily arranged and now if we are too late for dinner i think that we are both ready for our suppers
735799 ive been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the morning
735800 i guess i should have some credit for i have kept my promise if i hadnt sworn not to go about alone i might have had a more lively evening for i had a message from stapleton asking me over there
735801 i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening
735802 by the way i dont suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck
735803 this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes i fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police
735804 that is unlikely there was no mark on any of them so far as i know
735805 thats lucky for him in fact its lucky for all of you since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter i am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household watsons reports are most incriminating documents
735806 have you made anything out of the tangle i dont know that watson and i are much the wiser since we came down
735807 i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long it has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business there are several points upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same
735808 weve had one experience as watson has no doubt told you we heard the hound on the moor so i can swear that it is not all empty superstition i had something to do with dogs when i was out west and i know one when i hear one if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain ill be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time
735809 i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help
735810 very good and i will ask you also to do it blindly without always asking the reason
735811 if you will do this i think the chances are that our little
735812 watson wont allow that i know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ now these are a really very fine series of portraits
735813 i dont pretend to know much about these things and id be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture i didnt know that you found time for such things
735814 i know what is good when i see it and i see it now thats a kneller ill swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds they are all family portraits i presume
735815 barrymore has been coaching me in them and i think i can say my lessons fairly well
735816 that is rear admiral baskerville who served under rodney in the west indies the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskerville who was chairman of committees of the house of commons under pitt
735817 and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet and the lace
735818 ah you have a right to know about him that is the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who started the hound of the baskervilles were not likely to forget him
735819 he seems a quiet meek mannered man enough but i daresay that there was a lurking devil in his eyes i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person
735820 theres no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date 1647 are on the back of the canvas
735821 ha you see it now my eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings it is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise
735822 yes it is an interesting instance of a throw back which appears to be both physical and spiritual a study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation the fellow is a baskerville that is evident
735823 exactly this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links we have him watson we have him and i dare swear that before to morrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies a pin a cork and a card and we add him to the baker street collection
735824 the nets are all in place and the drag is about to begin well know before the day is out whether we have caught our big lean jawed pike or whether he has got through the meshes
735825 i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden i think i can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter and i have also communicated with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut as a dog does at his masters grave if i had not set his mind at rest about my safety
735826 you look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff
735827 that is the exact situation watson was asking for orders
735828 very good you are engaged as i understand to dine with our friends the stapletons to night
735829 i hope that you will come also they are very hospitable people and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you
735830 i fear that watson and i must go to london
735831 yes i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture
735832 i hoped that you were going to see me through this business the hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone
735833 my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you you can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you but that urgent business required us to be in town we hope very soon to return to devonshire will you remember to give them that message
735834 immediately after breakfast we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you watson you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come
735835 i have a good mind to go to london with you
735836 because it is your post of duty because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told and i tell you to stay
735837 one more direction i wish you to drive to merripit house send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home
735838 but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do
735839 this time you may do it with safety if i had not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it but it is essential that you should do it
735840 and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit house to the grimpen road and is your natural way home
735841 very good i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon
735842 you will take this train to town cartwright the moment you arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he finds the pocket book which i have dropped he is to send it by registered post to baker street
735843 and ask at the station office if there is a message for me
735844 wire received coming down with unsigned warrant arrive five forty lestrade
735845 that is in answer to mine of this morning he is the best of the professionals i think and we may need his assistance now watson i think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance mrs laura lyons
735846 i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late sir charles baskerville
735847 my friend here dr watson has informed me of what you have communicated and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter
735848 you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten oclock we know that that was the place and hour of his death you have withheld what the connection is between these events
735849 in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all i wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs lyons we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr stapleton but his wife as well
735850 the fact is no longer a secret the person who has passed for his sister is really his wife
735851 prove it to me prove it to me and if you can do so
735852 here is a photograph of the couple taken in york four years ago it is indorsed mr and mrs vandeleur but you will have no difficulty in recognising him and her also if you know her by sight here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of mr and mrs vandeleur who at that time kept st olivers private school read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people
735853 this man had offered me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband he has lied to me the villain in every conceivable way not one word of truth has he ever told me and why why i imagined that all was for my own sake but now i see that i was never anything but a tool in his hands why should i preserve faith with him who never kept any with me why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts ask me what you like and there is nothing which i shall hold back one thing i swear to you and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest friend
735854 the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred and you can check me if i make any material mistake the sending of this letter was suggested to you by stapleton
735855 i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce
735856 and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment
735857 he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us
735858 he appears to be a very consistent character and then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper
735859 and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles
735860 he did he said that the death was a very mysterious one and that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out he frightened me into remaining silent
735861 but if he had kept faith with me i should always have done so with him
735862 i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape
735863 you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice we must wish you good morning now mrs lyons and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again
735864 our case becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us
735865 i shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in grodno in little russia in the year 66 and of course there are the anderson murders in north carolina but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own even now we have no clear case against this very wily man but i shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night
735866 we have two hours before we need think of starting i think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor never been there ah well i dont suppose you will forget your first visit
735867 as long as i have my trousers i have a hip pocket and as long as i have my hip pocket i have something in it
735868 good my friend and i are also ready for emergencies
735869 youre mighty close about this affair mr holmes whats the game now
735870 my word it does not seem a very cheerful place
735871 i see the lights of a house ahead of us
735872 that is merripit house and the end of our journey i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper
735873 yes we shall make our little ambush here get into this hollow lestrade you have been inside the house have you not watson can you tell the position of the rooms what are those latticed windows at this end
735874 the blinds are up you know the lie of the land best creep forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heavens sake dont let them know that they are watched
735875 where can she be then since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen
735876 very serious indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans he cant be very long now it is already ten oclock our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path
735877 if he isnt out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered in half an hour we wont be able to see our hands in front of us
735878 we dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us at all costs we must hold our ground where we are
735879 there is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent we owe you a deep apology sir henry for having exposed you to this fright i was prepared for a hound but not for such a creature as this and the fog gave us little time to receive him
735880 having first endangered it are you strong enough to stand
735881 give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for anything so now if you will help me up what do you propose to do
735882 to leave you here you are not fit for further adventures to night if you will wait one or other of us will go back with you to the hall
735883 its a thousand to one against our finding him at the house
735884 those shots must have told him that the game was up
735885 we were some distance off and this fog may have deadened them
735886 he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be certain no no hes gone by this time but well search the house and make sure
735887 here lestrade your brandy bottle put her in the chair she has fainted from ill usage and exhaustion
735888 no no i did not mean my husband sir henry is he safe
735889 thank god thank god oh this villain see how he has treated me
735890 but this is nothing nothing it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled i could endure it all ill usage solitude a life of deception everything as long as i could still cling to the hope that i had his love but now i know that in this also i have been his dupe and his tool
735891 tell us then where we shall find him if you have ever aided him in evil help us now and so atone
735892 there is but one place where he can have fled
735893 there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge that is where he would fly
735894 no one could find his way into the grimpen mire to night
735895 how can he see the guiding wands to night we planted them together he and i to mark the pathway through the mire oh if i could only have plucked them out to day then indeed you would have had him at your mercy
735896 exactly he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon his track he fled when he knew the game was up still clutching it and he hurled it away at this point of his flight we know at least that he came so far in safety
735897 by jove a curly haired spaniel poor mortimer will never see his pet again well i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out house at merripit but it was always a risk and it was only on the supreme day which he regarded as the end of all his efforts that he dared to do it this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed it was suggested of course by the story of the family hell hound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death no wonder the poor wretch of a convict ran and screamed even as our friend did and as we ourselves might have done when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track it was a cunning device for apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it as many have done upon the moor i said it in london watson and i say it again now that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder
735898 from the point of view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct although to us who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts it all appeared exceedingly complex i have had the advantage of two conversations with mrs stapleton and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us you will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my indexed list of cases
735899 perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory
735900 certainly though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the
735901 we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to
735902 the baronet himself told him about the family hound and so
735903 having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with
735904 but it was some time coming the old gentleman could not
735905 he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance
735906 driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in
735907 so much for the death of sir charles baskerville you
735908 it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence
735909 it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of
735910 then we had the visit from our friends next morning
735911 we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman from that moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london and that therefore there was no chance for him there he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet
735912 you have no doubt described the sequence of events correctly but there is one point which you have left unexplained what became of the hound when its master was in london
735913 i have given some attention to this matter and it is
735914 it was my game to watch stapleton it was evident
735915 i have already told you that your reports reached me
735916 by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a
735917 it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incompatible emotions it was at least absolutely effective at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder she was ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst that revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so cleverly concealed by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired on the day of the crisis however his wife turned suddenly against him she had learned something of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound was being kept in the out house on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner she taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance of warning sir henry and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronets death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew in this i fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation and that if we had not been there his doom would none the less have been sealed a woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly and now my dear watson without referring to my notes i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case i do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained
735918 he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound
735919 the beast was savage and half starved if its appearance did not frighten its victim to death at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered
735920 no doubt there only remains one difficulty if stapleton came into the succession how could he explain the fact that he the heir had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property how could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry
735921 it is a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer mrs stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions there were three possible courses he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty and now my dear watson we have had some weeks of severe work and for one evening i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels i have a box for les huguenots have you heard the de reszkes might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcinis for a little dinner on the way
735922 quel est le site que vous utilisez le plus souvent pour couter une station de radio exclusivement sur internet
735923 quel est le site le plus utilis par les qu b cois pour regarder une station de t l vision exclusivement sur internet
735924 i suppose watson we must look upon you as a man of letters
735925 some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible if you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long suffering public you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal think of that little affair of the red headed men that was grotesque enough in the outset and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery or again there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips which led straight to a murderous conspiracy the word puts me on the alert
735926 oh man of course no woman would ever send a reply paid telegram she would have come
735927 my dear watson you know how bored i have been since we locked up colonel carruthers my mind is like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built life is commonplace the papers are sterile audacity and romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world can you ask me then whether i am ready to look into any new problem however trivial it may prove but here unless i am mistaken is our client
735928 i have had a most singular and unpleasant experience mr holmes
735929 never in my life have i been placed in such a situation it is most improper most outrageous i must insist upon some explanation
735930 may i ask in the first place why you came to me at all
735931 well sir it did not appear to be a matter which concerned
735932 quite so but in the second place why did you not come at once
735933 your telegram was dispatched about one but no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the mo ment of your waking
735934 you are right mr holmes i never gave a thought to my toilet i was only too glad to get out of such a house but i have been running round making inquiries before i came to you i went to the house agents you know and they said that mr garcias rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at wisteria lodge
735935 you are like my friend dr watson who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost please arrange your thoughts and let me know in their due sequence exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry in search of advice and assistance
735936 im sure it must look very bad mr holmes and i am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before but i will tell you the whole queer business and when i have done so you will admit i am sure that there has been enough to excuse me
735937 we are hunting together mr holmes and our trail lay in this direction
735938 are you mr john scott eccles of popham house lee
735939 exactly mr holmes we picked up the scent at charing cross post office and came on here
735940 but why do you follow me what do you want
735941 we wish a statement mr scott eccles as to the events which led up to the death last night of mr aloysius garcia of wisteria lodge near esher
735942 good god this is awful you dont mean you dont mean that i am suspected
735943 a letter of yours was found in the dead mans pocket and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house
735944 all you desire is a plain statement is it not
735945 and it is my duty to warn mr scott eccles that it may be used against him
735946 mr eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered
735947 in some way we struck up quite a friendship this young
735948 he had described his household to me before i went there
735949 i drove to the place about two miles on the south side of
735950 one thing comes back to my memory which may have a
735951 and now i come to the amazing part of my tale when i woke it was broad daylight i glanced at my watch and the time was nearly nine i had particularly asked to be called at eight so i was very much astonished at this forgetfulness i sprang up and rang for the servant there was no response i rang again and again with the same result then i came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order i huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water you can imagine my surprise when i found that there was no one there i shouted in the hall there was no answer then i ran from room to room all were deserted my host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before so i knocked at the door no reply i turned the handle and walked in the room was empty and the bed had never been slept in he had gone with the rest the foreign host the foreign footman the foreign cook all had vanished in the night that was the end of my visit to wisteria lodge
735952 your experience is so far as i know perfectly unique
735953 i was furious my first idea was that i had been the victim of some absurd practical joke i packed my things banged the hall door behind me and set off for esher with my bag in my hand i called at allan brothers the chief land agents in the village and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented it struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me and that the main object must be to get out of the rent it is late in march so quarter day is at hand but this theory would not work the agent was obliged to me for my warning but told me that the rent had been paid in advance then i made my way to town and called at the spanish embassy the man was unknown there after this i went to see melville at whose house i had first met garcia but i found that he really knew rather less about him than i did finally when i got your reply to my wire i came out to you since i gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases but now mr inspector i understand from what you said when you entered the room that you can carry the story on and that some tragedy has occurred i can assure you that every word i have said is the truth and that outside of what i have told you i know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man my only desire is to help the law in every possible way
735954 i am sure of it mr scott eccles i am sure of it
735955 i am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice for example there was that note which arrived during dinner did you chance to observe what became of it
735956 yes i did garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire
735957 it was a dog grate mr holmes and he overpitched it i picked this out unburned from the back of it
735958 you must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper
735959 i did mr holmes its my way shall i read it mr gregson
735960 the note is written upon ordinary cream laid paper without
735961 our own colours green and white green open white shut main stair first corridor seventh right green baize godspeed d it is a womans writing done with a sharp pointed pen but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else it is thicker and bolder as you see
735962 i must compliment you mr baynes upon your attention to detail in your examination of it a few trifling points might perhaps be added the oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve link what else is of such a shape the scissors were bent nail scissors short as the two snips are you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each
735963 i thought i had squeezed all the juice out of it but i see there was a little over
735964 im bound to say that i make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand and that a woman as usual was at the bottom of it
735965 i am glad you found the note since it corroborates my story
735966 but i beg to point out that i have not yet heard what has happened to mr garcia nor what has become of his household
735967 that is easily answered he was found dead this morning upon oxshott common nearly a mile from his home his head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instrument which had crushed rather than wounded it is a lonely corner and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot he had appar ently been struck down first from behind but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead it was a most furious assault there are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals
735968 but it is really uncommonly hard upon me i had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end how do i come to be mixled up with the case
735969 the only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death it was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead mans name and address it was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it i wired to mr gregson to run you down in london while i examined wisteria lodge then i came into town joined mr gregson and here we are
735970 we had best put this matter into an official shape you will come round with us to the station mr scott eccles and let us have your statement in writing
735971 certainly i will come at once but i retain your services mr holmes i desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth
735972 i suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you mr baynes
735973 you appear to have been very prompt and business like in all that you have done was there any clue may i ask as to the exact hour that the man met his death
735974 he had been there since one oclock there was rain about that time and his death had certainly been before the rain
735975 his voice is unmistakable i could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour
735976 on the face of it the case is not a very complex one though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features a fur ther knowledge of facts is necessary before i would venture to give a final and definite opinion by the way mr baynes did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examina tion of the house
735977 one or two vely remarkable things perhaps when i have finished at the police station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them
735978 you will show these gentlemen out mrs hudson and kindly send the boy with this telegram he is to pay a five shilling reply
735979 i can make nothing of this mystification of scott eccles
735980 well taken with the disappearance of the mans compan ions i should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice
735981 that is certainly a possible point of view on the face of it you must admit however that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest they had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week
735982 quite so why did they fly there is a big fact another big fact is the remarkable experience of our client scott eccles now my dear watson is it beyond the limits of human ingenu ity to furnish an explanation which would cover both these big facts if it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology why then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis if the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution
735983 you must admit my dear watson that the idea of a joke is impossible there were grave events afoot as the sequel showed and the coaxing of scott eccles to wisteria lodge had some connection with them
735984 let us take it link by link there is on the face of it something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young spaniard and scott eccles it was the former who forced the pace he called upon eccles at the other end of london on the very day after he first met him and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to esher now what did he want with eccles what could eccles supply i see no charm in the man he is not particularly intelligent not a man likely to be congenial to a quick witted latin why then was he picked out from all the other people whom garcia met as particu larly suited to his purpose has he any one outstanding quality i say that he has he is the very type of conventional british respectability and the very man as a witness to impress another briton you saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement extraordinary as it was
735985 nothing as things turned out but everything had they gone another way that is how i read the matter
735986 exactly my dear watson he might have proved an alibi we will suppose for arguments sake that the household of wisteria lodge are confederates in some design the attempt whatever it may be is to come off we will say before one oclock by some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got scott eccles to bed earlier than he thought but in any case it is likely that when garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve if garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation here was this irreproachable englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in his house all the time it was an insurance against the worst
735987 yes yes i see that but how about the disappearance of the others
735988 i have not all my facts yet but i do not think there are any insuperable difficulties still it is an error to argue in front of your data you find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories
735989 how did it run our own colours green and white sounds like racing green open white shut that is clearly a signal main stair first corridor seventh right green baize this is an assignation we may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all it was clearly a dangerous quest she would not have said godspeed had it not been so d that should be a guide
735990 the man was a spaniard i suggest that d stands for dolores a common female name in spain
735991 good watson very good but quite inadmissible a spaniard would write to a spaniard in spanish the writer of this note is certainly english well we can only possess our souls in pa tience until this excellent inspector comes back for us meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness
735992 this is a very obvious way of limiting our field of opera tions
735993 no doubt baynes with his methodical mind has already adopted some similar plan
735994 well my dear fellow we have already arrived at the conclu sion that the message received by garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation now if the obvious reading of it is correct and in order to keep this tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one it is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from oxshott since garcia was walking in that direction and hoped according to my reading of the facts to be back in wisteria lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi which would only be valid up to one oclock as the number of large houses close to oxshott must be limited i adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by scott eccles and obtaining a list of them here they are in this telegram and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them
735995 i am glad you have come sir it has been a long evening and l dont think my nerve is as good as it was
735996 your nerve walters i should not have thought you had a nerve in your body
735997 well sir its this lonely silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen then when you tapped at the window i thought it had come again
735998 the devil sir for all i know it was at the window
735999 it was just about two hours ago the light was just fading i was sitting reading in the chair i dont know what made me look up but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane lord sir what a face it was ill see it in my dreams
736000 tut tut walters this is not talk for a police constable
736001 i know sir i know but it shook me sir and theres no use to deny it it wasnt black sir nor was it white nor any colour that i know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it then there was the size of it it was twice yours sir and the look of it the great staring goggle eyes and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast i tell you sir i couldnt move a finger nor get my breath till it whisked away and was gone out i ran and through the shrubbery but thank god there was no one there
736002 if i didnt know you were a good man walters i should put a black mark against you for this if it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank god that he could not lay his hands upon him i suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves
736003 a number twelve shoe i should say if he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant
736004 he seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road
736005 whoever he may have been and whatever he may have wanted hes gone for the present and we have more immediate things to attend to now mr holmes with your permission i will show you round the house
736006 but now mr holmes i invite your attention to the kitchen
736007 something has been killed and something has been burned we raked all these out of the fire we had a doctor in this morning he says that they are not human
736008 i must congratulate you inspector on handling so distinc tive and instructive a case your powers if i may say so without offence seem superior to your opportunities
736009 youre right mr holmes we stagnate in the provinces a case of this sort gives a man a chance and i hope that i shall take it what do you make of these bones
736010 curious mr baynes very curious i should say almost unique
736011 yes sir there must have been some very strange people with some very strange ways in this house one of them is dead did his companions follow him and kill him if they did we should have them for every port is watched but my own views are different yes sir my own views are very different
736012 and ill work it myself mr holmes its only due to my own credit to do so your name is made but i have still to make mine i should be glad to be able to say afterwards that i had solved it without your help
736013 do you follow your path and i will follow mine my results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them i think that i have seen all that i wish in this house and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere au revoir and good luck
736014 im sure watson a week in the country will be invaluable to you
736015 it is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again with a spud a tin box and an elementary book on botany there are instructive days to be spent
736016 great excitement was caused in esher and the neigh bouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the oxshott murder it will be remembered that mr garcia of wiste ria lodge was found dead on oxshott common his body showing signs of extreme violence and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled which appeared to show their participation in the crime it was suggested but never proved that the deceased gentleman may have had valu ables in the house and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime every effort was made by inspector baynes who has the case in hand to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared it was certain from the first how ever that they would eventually be detected as the cook from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window was a man of most remarkable appearance being a huge and hideous mulatto with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type this man has been seen since the crime for he was detected and pursued by constable walters on the same evening when he had the audacity to revisit wisteria lodge inspector baynes considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely therefore to be repeated abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery the man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which constable downing was badly bitten by the savage we understand that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police and that great developments are hoped from his capture
736017 yes baynes ive seen it pray dont think it a liberty if i give you a word of friendly warning
736018 i have looked into this case with some care and i am not convinced that you are on the right lines i dont want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure
736019 we agreed to work on our own lines mr holmes thats what i am doing
736020 no sir i believe you mean well by me but we all have our own systems mr holmes you have yours and maybe i have mine
736021 youre welcome always to my news this fellow is a perfect savage as strong as a cart horse and as fierce as the devil he chewed downings thumb nearly off before they could master him he hardly speaks a word of english and we can get nothing out of him but grunts
736022 and you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master
736023 i didnt say so mr holmes i didnt say so we all have our little ways you try yours and i will try mine thats the agreement
736024 i cant make the man out he seems to be riding for a fall well as he says we must each try our own way and see what comes of it but theres something in inspector baynes which i cant quite understand
736025 we will go back to the note which was handed in to garcia
736026 we can now see a reason for the disappearance of garcias household they were all confederates in the same unknown crime if it came off when garcia returned any possible suspi cion would be warded off by the englishmans evidence and all would be well but the attempt was a dangerous one and if garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed it had been arranged therefore that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt that would fully explain the facts would it not
736027 we can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious something which he could not bear to part with had been left behind that would explain his persistence would it not
736028 the next step is the note received by garcia at the dinner it
736029 a singular set of people watson the man himself the most
736030 these two men close and confidential friends are the centre
736031 so much i learned partly from village gossip and partly from
736032 curious people watson i dont pretend to understand it all
736033 well now watson let us judge the situation by this new
736034 if she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and
736035 you will appreciate the difficulty of the situation watson there is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant our whole scheme might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate the womans disappearance counts for nothing since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week and yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life all i can do is to watch the house and leave my agent warner on guard at the gates we cant let such a situation continue if the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves
736036 i know which is her room it is accessible from the top of an outhouse my suggestion is that you and i go to night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery
736037 theyve gone mr holmes they went by the last train the lady broke away and ive got her in a cab downstairs
736038 i watched at the gate same as you advised mr holmes
736039 when the carriage came out i followed it to the station she was like one walking in her sleep but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled they pushed her into the carriage she fought her way out again i took her part got her into a cab and here we are i shant forget the face at the carriage window as i led her away id have a short life if he had his way the black eyed scowling yellow devil
736040 why sir youve got me the very evidence i want
736041 i was on the same scent as you from the first
736042 why mr holmes when you were crawling in the shrub bery at high gable i was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below it was just who would get his evidence first
736043 i was sure henderson as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger i arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him i knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of getting at miss burnet
736044 you will rise high in your profession you have instinct and intuition
736045 ive had a plain clothes man waiting at the station all the week wherever the high gable folk go he will keep them in sight but he must have been hard put to it when miss burnet broke away however your man picked her up and it all ends well we cant arrest without her evidence that is clear so the sooner we get a statement the better
736046 is don murillo once called the tiger of san pedro
736047 if you look it up you will find that the san pedro colours are green and white same as in the note mr holmes henderson he called himself but i traced him back paris and rome and madrid to barcelona where his ship came in in 86 theyve been looking for him all the time for their revenge but it is only now that they have begun to find him out
736048 once already his life has been attempted but some evil spirit shielded him now again it is the noble chivalrous garcia who has fallen while the monster goes safe but another will come and yet another until some day justice will be done that is as certain as the rise of sun
736049 how can an english lady join in such a murderous affair
736050 i join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained what does the law of england care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in san pedro or for the shipload of treasure which this man has stolen to you they are like crimes committed in some other planet but we know we have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering to us there is no fiend in hell like juan murillo and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance
736051 he was as you say i have heard that he was atrocious but how are you affected
736052 i will tell you it all this villains policy was to murder on
736053 then came the downfall af the tyrant he escaped as you
736054 but here also the ministers of justice were waiting knowing
736055 but everything went wrong with us in some way i had
736056 all would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done i have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance i was confined to my room terrorized by the most horrible threats cruelly ill used to break my spirit see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when i tried to call from the window for five days this cruel imprisonment continued with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together this afternoon a good lunch was brought me but the moment after i took it i knew that i had been drugged in a sort of dream i remember being half led half carried to the carriage in the same state i was conveyed to the train only then when the wheels were almost moving did i suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands i sprang out they tried to drag me back and had it not been for the help of this good man who led me to the cab i should never have broken away now thank god i am beyond their power forever
736057 a plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of self defence there may be a hundred crimes in the background but it is only on this one that they can be tried
736058 i think better of the law than that self defence is one thing to entice a man in cold blood with the object of murdering him is another whatever danger you may fear from him no no we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of high gable at the next guildford assizes
736059 it will not be possible for you to present it in that compact form which is dear to your heart it covers two conti nents concerns two groups of mysterious persons and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our friend scott eccles whose inclusion shows me that the deceased garcia had a scheming mind and a well developed instinct of self preservation it is remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we with our worthy collaborator the inspector have kept our close hold on the essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path is there any point which is not quite clear to you
736060 i think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it the man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of san pedro and this was his fetish when his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat already occupied no doubt by a confederate the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture but the mulattos heart was with it and he was driven back to it next day when on reconnoitring through the window he found policeman walters in possession he waited three days longer and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more inspector baynes who with his usual astuteness had minimized the incident before me had really recognized its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked any other point watson
736061 the torn bird the pail of blood the charred bones all the mystery of that weird kitchen
736062 i spent a morning in the british museum reading up on that
736063 so you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual it is grotesque watson
736064 but as i have had occasion to remark there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible
736065 look out of this window watson see how the figures loom up are dimly seen and then blend once more into the cloud bank the thief or the murderer could roam london on such a day as the tiger does the jungle unseen until he pounces and then evident only to his victim
736066 this great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that
736067 it is fortunate for this community that i am not a criminal
736068 suppose that i were brooks or woodhouse or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life how long could i survive against my own pursuit a summons a bogus appointment and all would be over it is well they dont have days of fog in the latin countries the countries of assassination by jove here comes something at last to break our dead monotony
736069 why not it is as if you met a tram car coming down a country lane mycroft has his rails and he runs on them his pall mall lodgings the diogenes club whitehall that is his cycle once and only once he has been here what upheaval can possibly have derailed him
736070 it recalls nothing to my mind but that mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion a planet might as well leave its orbit by the way do you know what mycroft is
736071 you told me that he had some small office under the british government
736072 i did not know you quite so well in those days one has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state you are right in thinking that he is under the british government you would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the british government
736073 i thought i might surprise you mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year remains a subordinate has no ambitions of any kind will receive neither honour nor title but remains the most indispensable man in the country
736074 well his position is unique he has made it for himself there has never been anything like it before nor will be again he has the tidiest and most orderly brain with the greatest capacity for storing facts of any man living the same great powers which i have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business the conclusions of every department are passed to him and he is the central exchange the clearing house which makes out the balance all other men are special ists but his specialism is omniscience we will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the navy india canada and the bimetallic question he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each but only mycroft can focus them all and say offhand how each factor would affect the other they began by using him as a short cut a convenience now he has made himself an essential in that great brain of his everything is pigeon holed and can be handed out in an instant again and again his word has decided the national policy he lives in it he thinks of nothing else save when as an intellectual exercise he unbends if i call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems but jupiter is descending to day what on earth can it mean who is cadogan west and what is he to mycroft
736075 yes yes here he is sure enough cadogan west was the young man who was found dead on the under ground on tuesday morning
736076 this must be serious watson a death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one what in the world can he have to do with it the case was featureless as i remember it the young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself he had not been robbed and there was no particular reason to suspect violence is that not so
736077 and a good many fresh facts have come out looked at more closely i should certainly say that it was a curious case
736078 judging by its effect upon my brother i should think it must be a most extraordinary one
736079 the mans name was arthur cadogan west he was twenty seven years of age unmarried and a clerk at woolwich arsenal
736080 he left woolwich suddenly on monday night was last seen by his fiancee miss violet westbury whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7 30 that evening there was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action the next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate layer named mason just outside aldgate station on the underground system in london
736081 the body was found at six on the tuesday morning it was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward at a point close to the station where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs the head was badly crushed an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train the body could only have come on the line in that way had it been carried down from any neighbouring street it must have passed the station barriers where a collector is always standing this point seems absolutely certain
736082 very good the case is definite enough the man dead or alive either fell or was precipitated from a train so much is clear to me continue
736083 the trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east some being purely metropolitan and some from willesden and outly ing junctions it can be stated for certain that this young man when he met his death was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state
736084 no ticket dear me watson this is really very singular according to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a metropolitan train without exhibiting ones ticket presumably then the young man had one was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came it is possible or did he drop it in the carriage that also is possible but the point is of curious interest i understand that there was no sign of robbery
736085 apparently not there is a list here of his possessions his purse contained two pounds fifteen he had also a check book on the woolwich branch of the capital and counties bank through this his identity was established there were also two dress circle tickets for the woolwich theatre dated for that very evening also a small packet of technical papers
736086 there we have it at last watson british government woolwich arsenal technical papers brother mycroft the chain is complete but here he comes if i am not mistaken to speak for himself
736087 i extremely dislike altering my habits but the powers that be would take no denial in the present state of siam it is most awkward that i should be away from the office but it is a real crisis i have never seen the prime minister so upset as to the admiralty it is buzzing like an overturned bee hive have you read up the case
736088 we have just done so what were the technical papers
736089 ah theres the point fortunately it has not come out the press would be furious if it did the papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the bruce partington submarine
736090 surely you have heard of it i thought everyone had heard of it
736091 its importance can hardly be exaggerated it has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets you may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a operation two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the estimates and was ex pended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention every effort has been made to keep the secret the plans which are exceed ingly intricate comprising some thirty separate patents each essential to the working of the whole are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal with burglar proof doors and windows under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office if the chief construc tor of the navy desired to consult them even he was forced to go to the woolwich office for the purpose and yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of london from an official point of view its simply awful
736092 no sherlock no thats the pinch we have not ten papers were taken from woolwich there were seven in the pocket of cadogan west the three most essential are gone stolen vanished you must drop everything sherlock never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police court its a vital international problem that you have to solve why did cadogan west take the papers where are the missing ones how did he die how came his body where it was found how can the evil be set right find an answer to all these questions and you will have done good service for your country
736093 why do you not solve it yourself mycroft you can see as far as i
736094 possibly sherlock but it is a question of getting details
736095 but the problem certainly presents some points of interest and i shall be very pleased to look into it some more facts please
736096 i have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper together with a few addresses which you will find of service the actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert sir james walter whose decorations and sub titles fill two lines of a book of reference he has grown gray in the service is a gentleman a favoured guest in the most exalted houses and above all a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion he is one of two who have a key of the safe i may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during work ing hours on monday and that sir james left for london about three oclock taking his key with him he was at the house of admiral sinclair at barclay square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred
736097 yes his brother colonel valentine walter has testified to his departure from woolwich and admiral sinclair to his arrival in london so sir james is no longer a direct factor in the problem
736098 the senior clerk and draughtsman mr sidney johnson he is a man of forty married with five children he is a silent morose man but he has on the whole an excellent record in the public service he is unpopular with his colleagues but a hard worker according to his own account corroborated only by the word of his wife he was at home the whole of monday evening after office hours and his key has never left the watch chain upon which it hangs
736099 he has been ten years in the service and has done good work he has the reputation of being hot headed and impetuous but a straight honest man we have nothing against him he was next to sidney johnson in the office his duties brought him into daily personal contact with the plans no one else had the handling of them
736100 well it is surely perfectly clear who took them away they are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk cadogan west that seems final does it not
736101 it does sherlock and yet it leaves so much unexplained in the first place why did he take them
736102 he could have got several thousands for them very easily
736103 can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to london except to sell them
736104 then we must take that as our working hypothesis young
736105 several false keys he had to open the building and the room
736106 he had then several false keys he took the papers to london to sell the secret intending no doubt to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed while in london on this treasonable mission he met his end
736107 we will suppose that he was travelling back to woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment
736108 aldgate where the body was found is considerably past the station for london bridge which would be his route to woolwich
736109 many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass london bridge there was someone in the carriage for example with whom he was havitlg an absorbing interview this interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life possibly he tried to leave the carriage fell out on the line and so met his end the other closed the door there was a thick fog and nothing could be seen
736110 no better explanation can be given with our present knowl edge and yet consider sherlock how much you leave un touched we will suppose for arguments sake that young cadogan west had determined to convey these papers to lon don he would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre escorted his fiancee halfway there and then suddenly disappeared
736111 a very singular one that is objection no 1 objection no 2 we will suppose that he reaches london and sees the foreign agent he must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered he took away ten only seven were in his pocket what had become of the other three he certainly would not leave them of his own free will then again where is the price of his treason one would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket
736112 i have no doubt at all as to what occurred he took the papers to sell them he saw the agent they could not agree as to price he started home again but the agent went with him in the train the agent murdered him took the more essential papers and threw his body from the carriage that would account for everything would it not
736113 the ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agents house therefore he took it from the murdered mans pocket
736114 your theory holds together but if this is true then the case is at an end on the one hand the traitor is dead on the other the plans of the bruce partington submarine are presumably already on the con tinent what is there for us to do
736115 all my instincts are against this explanation use your powers go to the scene of the crime see the people concerned leave no stone unturned in all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country
736116 come watson and you lestrade could you favour us with your company for an hour or two we will begin our investigation by a visit to aldgate station good bye mycroft i shall let you have a report before evening but i warn you in advance that you have little to expect
736117 it could not have fallen from above for these as you see are all blank walls therefore it could only have come from a train and that train so far as we can trace it must have passed about midnight on monday
736118 have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence
736119 there are no such signs and no ticket has been found
736120 a passenger who passed aldgate in an ordinary metropolitan train about 11 40 on monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud as of a body striking the line just before the train reached the station there was dense fog however and nothing could be seen he made no report of it at the time why whatever is the matter with mr holmes
736121 i suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this
736122 and a curve too points and a curve by jove if it were only so
736123 an idea an indication no more but the case certainly grows in interest unique perfectly unique and yet why not i do not see any indications of bleeding on the line
736124 the bone was crushed but there was no great external injury
736125 and yet one would have expected some bleeding would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog
736126 i fear not mr holmes the train has been broken up before now and the carriages redistributed
736127 that every carriage has been carefully examined i saw to it myself
736128 as it happens it was not the carriages which i desired to examine watson we have done all we can here we need not trouble you any further mr lestrade i think our investigations must now carry us to woolwich
736129 we certainly owe brother mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case
736130 i am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities
736131 the end is dark to me also but i have hold of one idea which may lead us far the man met his death elsewhere and his body was on the roof of a carriage
736132 remarkable is it not but consider the facts is it a coinci dence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off the points would affect no object inside the train either the body fell from the roof or a very curious coincidence has occurred but now consider the question of the blood of course there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere each fact is suggestive in itself together they have a cumulative force
736133 exactly we could not explain the absence of a ticket this would explain it everything fits together
736134 but suppose it were so we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death indeed it becomes not simpler but stranger
736135 we have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make
736136 i think that sir james walter claims our first attention
736137 perhaps you would care to step in sir and see his brother colonel valentine
736138 my brother sir james was a man of very sensitive honour and he could not survive such an affair it broke his heart he was always so proud of the efficiency of his department and this was a crush ing blow
736139 we had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up
736140 i assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us he had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police naturally he had no doubt that cadogan west was guilty but all the rest was inconceivable
736141 i know nothing myself save what i have read or heard i have no desire to be discourteous but you can understand mr holmes that we are much disturbed at present and i must ask you to hasten this interview to an end
736142 i wonder if the death was natural or whether the poor old fellow killed himself if the latter may it be taken as some sign of self reproach for duty neglected we must leave that question to the future now we shall turn to the cadogan wests
736143 i have not shut an eye since the tragedy thinking thinking thinking night and day what the true meaning of it can be arthur was the most single minded chivalrous patriotic man upon earth he would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a state secret confided to his keeping it is absurd impossible preposterous to anyone who knew him
736144 no his needs were very simple and his salary ample he had saved a few hundreds and we were to marry at the new year
736145 no signs of any mental excitement come miss westbury be absolutely frank with us
736146 i had a feeling that there was something on his mind
736147 only for the last week or so he was thoughtful and worried once i pressed him about it he admitted that there was some thing and that it was concerned with his official life it is too serious for me to speak about even to you said he i could get nothing more
736148 go on miss westbury even if it seems to tell against him go on we cannot say what it may lead to
736149 indeed i have nothing more to tell once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something he spoke one evening of the importance of the secret and i have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it
736150 he said that we were slack about such matters that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans
736151 we were to go to the theatre the fog was so thick that a cab was useless we walked and our way took us close to the office suddenly he darted away into the fog
736152 he gave an exclamation that was all i waited but he never returned then i walked home next morning after the office opened they came to inquire about twelve oclock we heard the terrible news oh mr holmes if you could only only save his honour it was so much to him
736153 it was black enough before against this young man but our inquiries make it blacker
736154 his coming marriage gives a motive for the crime he naturally wanted money the idea was in his head since he spoke about it he nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans it is all very bad
736155 but surely holmes character goes for something then again why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony
736156 exactly there are certainly objections but it is a formida ble case which they have to meet
736157 it is bad mr holmes very bad have you heard of the death of the chief
736158 the place is disorganized the chief dead cadogan west dead our papers stolen and yet when we closed our door on monday evening we were as efficient an office as any in the government service good god its dreadful to think of that west of all men should have done such a thing
736159 i can see no other way out of it and yet i would have trusted him as i trust myself
736160 there is but he has other departments to look after as well he is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man he saw nothing that evening of course the fog was very thick
736161 suppose that cadogan west wished to make his way into the building after hours he would need three keys would he not before he could reach the papers
736162 yes he would the key of the outer door the key of the office and the key of the safe
736163 i had no keys of the doors only of the safe
736164 was sir james a man who was orderly in his habits
736165 yes i think he was i know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring i have often seen them there
736166 then west if he is the culprit must have had a duplicate and yet none was found upon his body one other point if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals as was actually done
736167 it would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way
736168 but i suppose either sir james or you or west had that technical knowledge
736169 no doubt we had but i beg you wont try to drag me into the matter mr holmes what is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on west
736170 well it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies which would have equally served his turn
736171 every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable now there are three papers still missing they are as i under stand the vital ones
736172 do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers and without the seven others could construct a bruce partington submarine
736173 i reported to that effect to the admiralty but to day i have been over the drawings again and i am not so sure of it the double valves with the automatic self adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat of course they might soon get over the difficulty
736174 i think with your permission i will now take a stroll round me premises i do not recall any other question which i desired to ask
736175 the indications are ruined by the three days delay they may mean something or nothing well watson i do not think that woolwich can help us further it is a small crop which we have gathered let us see if we can do better in london
736176 i am not aware that in all our joint researches we
736177 the effect of our inquiries at woolwich has in the main been against young cadogan west but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis let us suppose for example that he had been approached by some foreign agent it might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancee very good we will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly in the fog caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office he was an impetuous man quick in his decisions everything gave way to his duty he followed the man reached the window saw the abstraction of the documents and pursued the thief in this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies this outsider had to take originals so far it holds together
736178 then we come into difficulties one would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young cadogan west would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm why did he not do so could it have been an official superior who took the papers that would explain wests conduct or could the chief have given west the slip in the fog and west started at once to london to head him off from his own rooms presuming that he knew where the rooms were the call must have been very pressing since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her our scent runs cold here and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of wests body with seven papers in his pocket on the roof of a metropolitan train my instinct now is to work from the other end if mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one
736179 that all the queens horses and all the queens men cannot avail in this matter
736180 things are turning a little in our direction at last why watson i do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off after all
736181 i am going out now it is only a reconnaissance i will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow do you stay here and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two if time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen abd begin your narrative of how we saved the state
736182 have you had something to eat then join me in a coffee and curacao try one of the proprietors cigars they are less poisonous than one would expect have you the tools
736183 excellent let me give you a short sketch of what i have done with some indication of what we are about to do now it must be evident to you watson that this young mans body was placed on the roof of the train that was clear from the instant that i determined the fact that it was from the roof and not from a carriage that he had fallen
736184 i should say it was impossible if you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded and there is no railing round them therefore we can say for certain that young cadogan west was placed on it
736185 that was the question which we had to answer there is only one possible way you are aware that the underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in the west end i had a vague memory that as i have travelled by it i have occasionally seen windows just above my head now suppose that a train halted under such a window would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof
736186 we must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail whatever remains however improbable must be the truth here all other contingencies have failed when i found that the leading international agent who had just left london lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the under ground i was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity
736187 yes that was it mr hugo oberstein of 13 caulfield gardens had become my objective i began my operations at gloucester road station where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back stair windows of caulfield gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact that owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways the underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot
736188 so far so far watson we advance but the goal is afar well having seen the back of caulfield gardens i visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown it is a considerable house unfurnished so far as i could judge in the upper rooms oberstein lived there with a single valet who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence we must bear in mind that oberstein has gone to the continent to dispose of his booty but not with any idea of flight for he had no reason to fear a warrant and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him yet that is precisely what we are about to make
736189 my dear fellow you shall keep watch in the street ill do the criminal part its not a time to stick at trifles think of mycrofts note of the admiralty the cabinet the exalted person who waits for news we are bound to go
736190 it is nearly half a mile but there is no hurry let us walk
736191 dont drop the instruments i beg your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication
736192 it is certainly bolted as well as locked we would do better in the area there is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude give me a hand watson and ill do the same for you
736193 you can see where they rested the body halloa watson what is this there can be no doubt that it is a blood mark
736194 here it is on the stone of the stair also the demon
736195 a masterpiece you have never risen to a greater height
736196 i cannot agree with you there from the moment that i conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof which surely was not a very abstruse one all the rest was inevitable if it were not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant our difficulties are still before us but perhaps we may find something here which may help us
736197 he has left nothing to incriminate him his dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed this is our last chance
736198 whats this watson eh whats this record of a series of
736199 hoped to hear sooner terms agreed to write fully to
736200 a fairly complete record watson if we could only get at the man at the other end
736201 well perhaps it wont be so difficult after all there is nothing more to be done here watson i think we might drive round to the offices of the daily telegraph and so bring a good days work to a conclusion
736202 we cant do these things in the force mr holmes
736203 no wonder you get results that are beyond us but some of these days youll go too far and youll find yourself and your friend in trouble
736204 for england home and beauty eh watson martyrs on the altar of our country but what do you think of it mycroft
736205 excellent sherlock admirable but what use will you make of it
736206 that was my idea when i put it in i think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight oclock to caulfield gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution
736207 you can write me down an ass this time watson
736208 this was not the bird that i was looking for
736209 the younger brother of the late sir james walter the head of the submarine department yes yes i see the fall of the cards he is coming to i think that you had best leave his examination to me
736210 how an english gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension but your whole correspondence and rela tions with oberstein are within our knowledge so also are the circumstances connected with the death of young cadogan west let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips
736211 that every essential is already known we know that you were pressed for money that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held and that you entered into a correspondence with oberstein who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the daily telegraph we are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on monday night but that you were seen and followed by young cadogan west who had probably some previous reason to suspect you he saw your theft but could not give the alarm as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in london leaving all his private concerns like the good citizen that he was he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house there he intervened and then it was colonel walter that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder
736212 i did not i did not before god i swear that i did not
736213 tell us then how cadogan west met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage
736214 i will i swear to you that i will i did the rest i confess it it was just as you say a stock exchange debt had to be paid i needed the money badly oberstein offered me five thousand it was to save myself from ruin but as to murder i am as innocent as you
736215 he had his suspicions before and he followed me as you describe i never knew it until i was at the very door it was thick fog and one could not see three yards i had given two taps and oberstein had come to the door the young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers oberstein had a short life preserver he always carried it with him as west forced his way after us into the house oberstein struck him on the head the blow was a fatal one he was dead within five minutes there he lay in the hall and we were at our wits end what to do then oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window but first he examined the papers which i had brought he said that three of them were essential and that he must keep them you cannot keep them said i there will be a dreadful row at woolwich if they are not returned i must keep them said he for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies then they must all go back together tonight said i he thought for a little and then he cried out that he had it three i will keep said he the others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man when he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account i could see no other way out of it so we did as he suggested we waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped it was so thick that nothing could be seen and we had no difficulty in lowering wests body on to the train that was the end of the matter so far as i was concerned
736216 he said nothing but he had caught me once with his keys and i think that he suspected i read in his eyes that he sus pected as you know he never held up his head again
736217 can you not make reparation it would ease your con science and possibly your punishment
736218 he said that letters to the hotel du louvre paris would eventually reach him
736219 i will do anything i can i owe this fellow no particular good will he has been my ruin and my downfall
736220 here are paper and pen sit at this desk and write to my
736221 with regard to our transaction you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing i have a tracing which will make it complete this has involved me in extra trouble however and i must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds i will not trust it to the post nor will i take anything but gold or notes i would come to you abroad but it would excite remark if i left the country at present therefore i shall expect to meet you in the smoking room of the charing cross hotel at noon on saturday remember that only english notes or gold will be taken that will do very well i shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man
736222 the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night it is the most unheard of business we can only regard it as a special providence that you should chance to be here at the time for in all england you are the one man we need
736223 well as you seem to have made the discovery whatever it may be and the vicar to have had it second hand perhaps you had better do the speaking
736224 and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from mr tregennis or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious affair i may explain then that our friend here spent last evening in the company of his two brothers owen and george and of his sister brenda at their house of tredannick wartha which is near the old stone cross upon the moor he left them shortly after ten oclock playing cards round the dining room table in excellent health and spirits this morning being an early riser he walked in that direction before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of dr richards who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent call to tredannick wartha mr mortimer tregennis naturally went with him when he arrived at tredannick wartha he found an extraordinary state of things his two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them the cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned down to their sockets the sister lay back stone dead in her chair while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing shouting and singing the senses stricken clean out of them all three of them the dead woman and the two demented men retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror a convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon there was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house except mrs porter the old cook and housekeeper who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night nothing had been stolen or disarranged and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses there is the situation mr holmes in a nutshell and if you can help us to clear it up you will have done a great work
736225 on the face of it it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature have you been there yourself mr roundhay
736226 no mr holmes mr tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage and i at once hurried over with him to consult you
736227 how far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred
736228 then we shall walk over together but before we start i must ask you a few questions mr mortimer tregennis
736229 it is a bad thing to speak of but i will answer you the truth
736230 well mr holmes i supped there as the vicar has said and my elder brother george proposed a game of whist afterwards we sat down about nine oclock it was a quarter past ten when i moved to go i left thern all round the table as merry as could be
736231 mrs porter had gone to bed so i let myself out i shut the hall door behind me the window of the room in which they sat was closed but the blind was not drawn down there was no change in door or window this morning nor any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house yet there they sat driven clean mad with terror and brenda lying dead of fright with her head hanging over the arm of the chair ill never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as i live
736232 the facts as you state them are certainly most remarkable
736233 i take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them
736234 it is not of this world something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds what human contrivance could do that
736235 that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this as to yourself mr tregenrlis i take it you were divided in some way from your family since they lived together and you had rooms apart
736236 that is so mr holmes though the matter is past and done with we were a family of tin miners at redruth but we sold out our venture to a company and so retired with enough to keep us i wont deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time but it was all forgiven and forgotten and we were the best of friends together
736237 looking back at the evening which you spent together does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy think carefully mr tregennis for any clue which can help me
736238 were they nervous people did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger
736239 you have nothing to add then which could assist me
736240 as we sat at the table my back was to the window and my brother george he being my partner at cards was facing it i saw him once look hard over my shoulder so i turned round and looked also the blind was up and the window shut but i could just make out the bushes on the lawn and it seemed to me for a moment that i saw something moving among them i couldnt even say if it was man or animal but i just thought there was something there when i asked him what he was looking at he told me that he had the same feeling that is all that i can say
736241 i am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning
736242 i am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast this morning i had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me he told me that old mrs porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message i sprang in beside him and we drove on when we got there we looked into that dreadful room the candles and the fire must have burned out hours before and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken the doctor said brenda must have been dead at least six hours there were no signs of violence she just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face george and owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes oh it was awful to see i couldnt stand it and the doctor was as white as a sheet indeed he fell into a chair in a sort of faint and we nearly had him on our hands as well
736243 i think perhaps we had better go down to tredannick wartha without further delay i confess that i have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem
736244 had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening
736245 i think watson that i shall resume that course of tobacco poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned
736246 with your permission gentlemen we will now return to our cottage for i am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here i will turn the facts over in my mind mr tregennis and should anything occur to me i will certainly communicate with you and the vicar in the meantime i wish you both good morning
736247 let us get a firm grip of the very little which we do
736248 our next obvious step is to check so far as we can the movements of
736249 if then mortimer tregennis disappeared from the scene and yet some outside person affected the cardplayers how can we reconstruct that person and how was such an impression of horror conveyed mrs porter may be eliminated she is evidently harmless is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses the only suggestion in this direction comes from mortimer tregennis himself who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden that is certainly remarkable as the night was rainy cloudy and dark anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen there is a three foot flowerborder outside this window but no indication of a footmark it is difficult to imagine then how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt you perceive our difficulties watson
736250 and yet with a little more material we may prove that they are not insurmountable
736251 i fancy that among your extensive archives watson you may find some which were nearly as obscure meanwhile we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man
736252 but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation my only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here i have come to know this family of tregennis very well indeed upon my cornish mothers side i could call them cousins and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me i may tell you that i had got as far as plymouth upon my way to africa but the news reached me this morning and i came straight back again to help in the inquiry
736253 quite so cousins of your mother was your baggage aboard the ship
736254 some of it but the main part at the hotel
736255 i see but surely this event could not have found its way into the plymouth morning papers
736256 it was mr roundhay the vicar who sent me the telegram which recalled me
736257 i may say in answer to your original question that i have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case but that i have every hope of reaching some conclusion it would be premature to say more
736258 perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction
736259 then i have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit
736260 i learned the name of it from the vicar and i wired to make certain that dr leon stemdales account was true it appears that he did indeed spend last night there and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to africa while he returned to be present at this investigation what do you make of that watson
736261 deeply interested yes there is a thread here which we have not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle cheer up watson for i am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand when it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us
736262 we are devil ridden mr holmes my poor parish is devilridden
736263 satan himself is loose in it we are given over into his hands
736264 mr mortimer tregennis died during the night and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family
736265 then watson we will postpone our breakfast mr roundhay we are
736266 i am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren
736267 i cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police but i should be exceedingly obliged mr roundhay if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sittingroom lamp each is suggestive and together they are almost conclusive if the police would desire further information i shall be happy to see any of them at the conage and now watson i think that perhaps we shall be better employed elsewhere
736268 that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us this concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it you will recollect that mortimer tregennis in describing the episode of his last visit to his brothers house remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair you had forgotten well i can answer for it that it was so now you will remember also that mrs porter the housekeeper told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window in the second case that of mortimer tregennis himself you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived though the servant had thrown open the window that servant i found upon inquiry was so ill that she had gone to her bed you will admit watson that these facts are very suggestive in each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere in each case also there is combustion going on in the room in the one case a fire in the other a lamp the fire was needed but the lamp was lit as a comparison of the oil consumed will show long after it was broad daylight why surely because there is some connection between three things the burning the stuffy atmosphere and finally the madness or death of those unfortunate people that is clear is it not
736269 at least we may accept it as a working hypothesis we will suppose then
736270 with this train of reasoning in my head i naturally looked about in mortimer tregenniss room to find some remains of this substance the obvious place to look was the talc shield or smoke guard of the lamp there sure enough i perceived a number of flaky ashes and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder which had not yet been consumed half of this i took as you saw and i placed it in an envelope
736271 it is not for me my dear watson to stand in the way of the official police force i leave them all the evidence which i found the poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it now watson we will light our lamp we will however take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society and you will seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless like a sensible man you determine to have nothing to do with the affair oh you will see it out will you i thought i knew my watson this chair i will place opposite yours so that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face the door we will leave ajar each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming is that all clear well then i take our powder or what remains of it from the envelope and i lay it above the burning lamp so now watson let us sit down and await developments
736272 i owe you both my thanks and an apology it was an unjustifiable experiment even for ones self and doubly so for a friend i am really very sorry
736273 that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you
736274 it would be superfluous to drive us mad my dear watson
736275 a candid observer would celtainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment i confess that i never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe
736276 we must give the room a little time to clear i take it watson that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced
736277 but the cause remains as obscure as before come into the arbour here and let us discuss it together that villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat i think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man mortimer tregennis having been the criminal in the first tragedy though he was the victim in the second one we must remember in the first place that there is some story of a family quarrel followed by a reconciliation how bitter that quarrel may have been or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell when i think of mortimer tregennis with the foxy face and the small shrewd beady eyes behind the spectacles he is not a man whom i should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition well in the next place you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy emanated from him he had a motive in misleading us finally if he did not throw this substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room who did do so the affair happened immediately after his departure had anyone else come in the family would certainly have risen from the table besides in peaceful cornwall visitors do not arrive after ten oclock at night we may take it then that all the evidence points to mortimer tregennis as the culprit
736278 well watson it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition the man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself there are however some cogent reasons against it forturlately there is one man in england who knows all about it and i have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips ah he is a little before his time perhaps you would kindly step this way dr leon sterndale we have been conducting a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor
736279 you sent for me mr holmes i had your note about an hour ago and i have come though i really do not know why i should obey your summons
736280 perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate
736281 meanwhile i am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence you will excuse this informal reception in the open air but my friend watson and i have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the cornish horror and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present perhaps since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping
736282 what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion
736283 i have lived so long among savages and beyond the law
736284 that i have got into the way of being a law to myself you would do well mr holmes not to forget it for i have no desire to do you an injury
736285 nor have i any desire to do you an injury dr sterndale surely the clearest proof of it is that knowing what i know i have sent for you and not for the police
736286 if this is bluff upon your part mr holmes you have chosen a bad man for your experiment let us have no more beating about the bush what do you mean
736287 and the reason why i tell you is that i hope frankness may beget frankness what my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence
736288 do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff
736289 i have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate we will pass that you came down here to ask me whom i suspected i refused to answer you you then went to the vicarage waited outside it for some time and finally returned to your cottage
736290 that is what you may expect to see when i follow you you spent a restless night at your cottage and you formed certain plans which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution leaving your door just as day was breaking you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate
736291 you then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage you were wearing i may remark the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet at the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge coming out under the window of the lodger tregennis it was now daylight but the household was not yet stirring you drew some of the gravel from your pocket and you threw it up at the window above you
736292 it took two or possibly three handfuls before the lodger came to the window you beckoned him to come down he dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting room you entered by the window there was an interview a short one during which you walked up and down the room then you passed out and closed the window standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred finally after the death of tregennis you withdrew as you had come now dr sterndale how do you justify such conduct and what were the motives for your actions if you prevaricate or trifle with me i give you my assurance that the matter will pass out ol my hands forever
736293 for years i have loved her for years she has loved me there is the secret of that cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at it has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me i could not marry her for i have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom by the deplorable laws of england i could not divorce for years brenda waited for years i waited and this is what we have waited for
736294 the vicar knew he was in our confidence he would tell you that she was an angel upon earth that was why he telegraphed to me and i returned what was my baggage or africa to me when i learned that such a fate had come upon my darling there you have the missing clue to my action mr holmes
736295 i understand that you are a doctor sir have you ever heard of this preparation
736296 for i believe that save for one sample in a laboratory at buda there is no other specimen in europe it has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopceia or into the literature of toxicology the root is shaped like a foot half human half goatlike hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary it is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine men in certain districts of west africa and is kept as a secret among them this particular specimen i obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the ubangi country
736297 i am about to tell you mr holmes all that actually occurred for you
736298 one day only a couple of weeks ago he came down to my cottage and i
736299 i thought no more of the matter until the vicars telegram reached me at
736300 should i appeal to the law where were my proofs i knew that the facts
736301 now i have told you all you have yourself supplied the rest i did as
736302 i had intended to bury myself in central africa my work there is but half finished
736303 some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change
736304 i think you must agree watson that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere our investigation has been independent and our action shall be so also you would not denounce the man
736305 i have never loved watson but if i did and if the woman i loved had met such an end i might act even as our lawless lion hunter has done who knows well watson i will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious the gravel upon the window sill was of course the starting point of my research it was unlike anything in the vicarage garden only when my attention had been drawn to dr sterndale and his cottage did i find its counterpart the lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain and now my dear watson i think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those chaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the cornish branch of the great celtic speech
736306 well mrs warren i cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness nor do i understand why i whose time is of some value should interfere in the matter i really have other things to engage me
736307 you arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year
736308 but he would never cease talking of it your kindness sir and the way in which you brought light into the darkness i remembered his words when i was in doubt and darkness myself i know you could if you only would
736309 well well mrs warren let us hear about it then you dont object to tobacco i take it thank you watson the matches you are uneasy as i understand because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him why bless you mrs warren if i were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end
736310 no doubt sir but this is different it frightens me mr holmes i cant sleep for fright to hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him its more than i can stand my husband is as nervous over it as i am but he is out at his work all day while i get no rest from it what is he hiding for what has he done except for the girl i am all alone in the house with him and its more than my nerves can stand
736311 if i take it up i must understand every detail
736312 take time to consider the smallest point may be the most essential you say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnights board and lodging
736313 he asked my terms sir i said fifty shillings a week there is a small sitting room and bedroom and all complete at the top of the house
736314 he said ill pay you five pounds a week if i can have it on
736315 well sir they were that he was to have a key of the house that was all right lodgers often have them also that he was to be left entirely to himself and never upon any excuse to be disturbed
736316 not in reason sir but this is out of all reason he has been there for ten days and neither mr warren nor i nor the girl has once set eyes upon him we can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down up and down night morning and noon but except on that first night he has never once gone out of the house
736317 yes sir and returned very late after we were all in bed he told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door i heard him come up the stair after midnight
736318 it was his particular direction that we should always when he rang leave his meal upon a chair outside his door then he rings again when he has finished and we take it down from the same chair if he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it
736319 yes sir prints it in pencil just the word nothing more heres one i brought to show you soap heres another match this is one he left the first morning daily gazette i leave that paper with his breakfast every morning
736320 this is certainly a little unusual seclusion i can understand but why print printing is a clumsy process why not write what would it suggest watson
736321 but why what can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word of his writing still it may be as you say then again why such laconic messages
736322 it opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation the words are written with a broad pointed violet tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern you will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done so that the s of soap is partly gone suggestive watson is it not
736323 exactly there was evidently some mark some thumbprint something which might give a clue to the persons identity now mrs warren you say that the man was of middle size dark and bearded what age would he be
736324 he spoke good english sir and yet i thought he was a foreigner by his accent
736325 very smartly dressed sir quite the gentleman dark clothes nothing you would note
736326 but surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning
736327 dear me that is certainly remarkable what about his luggage
736328 he had one big brown bag with him nothing else
736329 well we dont seem to have much material to help us do you say nothing has come out of that room absolutely nothing
736330 they were on his tray this morning i brought them because i had heard that you can read great things out of small ones
736331 the matches have of course been used to light cigarettes that is obvious from the shortness of the but end half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar but dear me this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable the gentleman was bearded and moustached you say
736332 i dont understand that i should say that only a clean shaven man could have smoked this why watson even your modest moustache would have been singed
736333 no no the end is matted i suppose there could not be two people in your rooms mrs warren
736334 no sir he eats so little that i often wonder it can keep life in one
736335 well i think we must wait for a little more material after
736336 there are certainly some points of interest in this case watson
736337 it may of course be trivial individual eccentricity or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface the first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them
736338 well apart from this cigarette end was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms he came back or someone came back when all witnesses were out of the way we have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out then again the man who took the rooms spoke english well this other however prints match when it should have been matches i can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary which would give the noun but not the plural the laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of english yes watson there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitu tion of lodgers
736339 ah there lies our problem there is one rather obvious line of investigation
736340 what a chorus of groans cries and bleatings what a rag bag of singular happen ings but surely the most valuable hunting ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual this person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired how is any news or any message to reach him from without obviously by advertisement through a newspaper there seems no other way and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only here are the daily gazette extracts of the last fortnight lady with a black boa at princes skating club that we may pass surely jimmy will not break his mothers heart that appears to be irrelevant if the lady who fainted in the brixton bus she does not interest me every day my heart longs bleat watson unmitigated bleat ah this is a little more possible listen to this be patient will find some sure means of communication mean while this column g that is two days after mrs warrens lodger arrived it sounds plausible does it not the mysterious one could understand english even if he could not print it let us see if we can pick up the trace again yes here we are three days later am making successful arrangements patience and prudence the clouds will pass g nothing for a week after that then comes something much more definite the path is clearing if i find chance signal message remember code agreed one a two b and so on you will hear soon g that was in yesterdays paper and there is nothing in its all very appropriate to mrs warrens lodger if we wait a little watson i dont doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible
736341 high red house with white stone facings third floor second window left after dusk g that is definite enough i think after breakfast we must make a little reconnais sance of mrs warrens neighbourhood ah mrs warren what news do you bring us this morning
736342 ah thats what we want to know it was this morning sir mr warren is a timekeeper at morton and waylights in tottenham court road he has to be out of the house before seven well this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him threw a coat over his head and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb they drove him an hour and then opened the door and shot him out he lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab when he picked himself up he found he was on hampstead heath so he took a bus home and there he lies now on the sofa while i came straight round to tell you what had happened
736343 did he observe the ap pearance of these men did he hear them talk
736344 no he is clean dazed he just knows that he was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by magic two at least were in it and maybe three
736345 well weve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before ive had enough of him moneys not every thing ill have him out of my house before the day is done
736346 wait a bit mrs warren do nothing rash i begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight it is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger it is equally clear that his enemies lying in wait for him near your door mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light on discovering their mistake they released him what they would have done had it not been a mistake we can only conjecture
736347 i have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours mrs warren
736348 i dont see how that is to be managed unless you break in the door i always hear him unlock it as i go down the stair after i leave the tray
736349 he has to take the tray in surely we could conceal ourselves and see him do it
736350 well sir theres the box room opposite i could arrange a
736351 then dr watson and i will come round in time for the present mrs warren good bye
736352 high red house with stone facings there is the signal station all right we know the place and we know the code so surely our task should be simple theres a to let card in that window it is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access well mrs warren what now
736353 i have it all ready for you if you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing ill put you there now
736354 i think watson we can discuss this business better in our own quarters
736355 there has been a substitution of lodgers what i did not foresee is that we should find a woman and no ordinary woman watson
736356 well she saw something to alarm her that is certain the general sequence of events is pretty clear is it not a couple seek refuge in london from a very terrible and instant danger the measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions the man who has some work which he must do desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it it is not an easy problem but he solved it in an original fashion and so effec tively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food the printed messages as is now evident were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing the man cannot come near the woman or he will guide their enemies to her since he cannot communicate with her direct he has recourse to the agony column of a paper so far all is clear
736357 ah yes watson severely practical as usual what is at the root of it all mrs warrens whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed this much we can say that it is no ordinary love escapade you saw the womans face at the sign of danger we have heard too of the attack upon the landlord which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger these alarms and the desperate need for secrecy argue that the matter is one of life or death the attack upon mr warren further shows that the enemy whoever they are are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male it is very curious and complex watson
736358 why should you go further in it what have you to gain from it
736359 what indeed it is art for arts sake watson i suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without though of a fee
736360 education never ends watson it is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last this is an instructive case there is neither money nor credit in it and yet one would wish to tidy it up when dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage ad vanced in our investigation
736361 yes i can see his shadow there he is again he has a candle in his hand now he is peering across he wants to be sure that she is on the lookout now he begins to flash take the message also watson that we may check each other a single flash that is a surely now then how many did you make it twenty so did i that should mean t at thats intelligible enough another t surely this is the beginning of a second word now then tenta dead stop that cant be all watson attenta gives no sense nor is it any better as three words at ten ta unless t a are a persons initials there it goes again whats that atte why it is the same message over again curious watson very curious now he is off once more at why he is repeating it for the third time attenta three times how often will he repeat it no that seems to be the finish he has withdrawn from the window what do you make of it watson
736362 why of course it is italian the a means that it is addressed to a woman beware beware beware hows that watson
736363 not a doubt of it it is a very urgent message thrice repeated to make it more so but beware of what wait a bit he is coming to the window once more
736364 there is some devilry going forward why should such a message stop in such a way i should put scotland yard in touch with this business and yet it is too pressing for us to leave
736365 we must define the situation a little more clearly it may bear some more innocent interpretation come watson let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it
736366 journeys end with lovers meet ings what brings you here
736367 different threads but leading up to the same tangle ive been taking the signals
736368 yes from that window they broke off in the middle we came over to see the reason but since it is safe in your hands i see no object in continuing the business
736369 ill do you this justice mr holmes that i was never in a case yet that i didnt feel stronger for having you on my side theres only the one exit to these flats so we have him safe
736370 well well we score over you for once mr holmes you must give us best this time
736371 i am on the trail of my life now mr holmes
736372 oh he has a european fame has he well weve learned all about him in america we know he is at the bottom of fifty murders and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on i tracked him over from new york and ive been close to him for a week in london waiting some excuse to get my hand on his collar mr gregson and i ran him to ground in that big tenement house and theres only the one door so he cant slip us theres three folk come out since he went in but ill swear he wasnt one of them
736373 i expect as usual he knows a good deal that we dont
736374 well it figures out that way does it not here he is sending out messages to an accomplice there are several of his gang in london then suddenly just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger he broke short off what could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street or in some way come to understand how close the danger was and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it what do you suggest mr holmes
736375 that we go up at once and see for ourselves
736376 that is good enough for the moment when we have him by the heels we can see if new york cant help us to keep him ill take the responsibility of arresting him now
736377 you say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting downstairs
736378 was there a fellow about thirty black bearded dark of middle size
736379 that is your man i fancy i can give you his description and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark that should be enough for you
736380 perhaps not that is why i thought it best to summon this lady to your aid
736381 but you you are police are you not you have killed giuseppe gorgiano is it not so
736382 he is my hus band gennaro lucca i am emilia lucca and we are both from new york where is gennaro he called me this moment from this window and i ran with all my speed
736383 your cipher was not difficult madam your presence here was desirable i knew that i had only to flash vieni and you would surely come
736384 now i see it my gennaro my splendid beautiful gennaro who has guarded me safe from all harm he did it with his own strong hand he killed the monster oh gennaro how wonderful you are what woman could ever be worthy of such a man
736385 i am not very clear yet who you are or what you are but youve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the yard
736386 i rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it you understand madam that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us what you say may be used in evidence but if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal and which he would wish to have known then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the whole story
736387 he was a devil and a monster and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him
736388 my suggestion is that we lock this door leave things as we found them go with this lady to her room and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us
736389 fortune was very good to us at first gennaro was able to do
736390 one night when gennaro returned from his work he brought
736391 he came again and again yet i was aware that gennaro was
736392 he told me and my own heart grew cold as ice as i listened
736393 that was bad enough but worse was to come i had noticed
736394 a few days later came the meeting gennaro returned from it
736395 all that night we sat together our arms round each other
736396 the rest gentlemen you know for yourselves we were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows gorgiano had his private reasons for vengeance but in any case we knew how ruthless cunning and untiring he could be both italy and america are full of stories of his dreadful powers if ever they were exerted it would be now my darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me for his own part he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the american and with the italian police i do not myself know where he lived or how all that i learned was through the columns of a newspaper but once as i looked through my window i saw two italians watching the house and i understood that in some way gorgiano had found out our retreat finally gennaro told me through the paper that he would signal to me from a certain window but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings which were suddenly interrupted it is very clear to me now that he knew gorgiano to be close upon him and that thank god he was ready for him when he came and now gentlemen i would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my gennaro for what he has done
736397 i dont know what your british point of view may be but i guess that in new york this ladys husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks
736398 she will have to come with me and see the chief
736399 if what she says is corroborated i do not think she or her husband has much to fear but what i cant make head or tail of mr holmes is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter
736400 education gregson education still seeking knowledge at the old university well watson you have one more specimen of the tragic and grotesque to add to your collection by the way it is not eight oclock and a wagner night at covent garden if we hurry we might be in time for the second act
736401 the bath why the relaxing and expen sive turkish rather than the invigorating home made article
736402 because for the last few days i have been feeling rheumatic
736403 i have no doubt the connection between my boots and a turkish bath is a perfectly self evident one to a logical mind and yet i should be obliged to you if you would indicate it
736404 it belongs to the same elementary class of deduction which i should illustrate if i were to ask you who shared your cab in your drive this morning
736405 i dont admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation
736406 bravo watson a very dignified and logical remonstrance let me see what were the points take the last one first the cab you observe that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes and if you had they would certainly have been symmetrical therefore it is clear that you sat at the side therefore it is equally clear that you had a companion
736407 equally childish you are in the habit of doing up your boots in a certain way i see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate double bow which is not your usual method of tying them you have therefore had them off who has tied them a bootmaker or the boy at the bath it is unlikely that it is the bootmaker since your boots are nearly new well what re mains the bath absurd is it not but for all that the turkish bath has served a purpose
736408 you say that you have had it because you need a change let me suggest that you take one how would lausanne do my dear watson first class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale
736409 is the drifting and friendless woman she is the most harmless and often the most useful of mortals but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in others she is helpless she is migratory she has sufficient means to take her from country to country and from hotel to hotel she is lost as often as not in a maze of obscure pensions and boarding houses she is a stray chicken in a world of foxes when she is gobbled up she is hardly missed i much fear that some evil has come to the lady frances carfax
736410 is the sole survivor of the direct family of the late earl of rufton the estates went as you may remember in the male line she was left with limited means but with some very remarkable old spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut diamonds to which she was fondly attached too attached for she refused to leave them with her banker and always carried them about with her a rather pathetic figure the lady frances a beautiful woman still in fresh mid dle age and yet by a strange chance the last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet
736411 ah what has happened to the lady frances is she alive or dead there is our problem she is a lady of precise habits and for four years it has been her invariable custom to write every second week to miss dobney her old governess who has long retired and lives in camberwell it is this miss dobney who has consulted me nearly five weeks have passed without a word the last letter was from the hotel national at lausanne lady frances seems to have left there and given no address the family are anxious and as they are exceedingly wealthy no sum wlll be spared if we can clear the matter up
736412 is miss dobney the only source of information surely she had other correspondents
736413 there is one correspondent who is a sure draw watson that is the bank single ladies must live and their passbooks are compressed diaries she banks at silvesters i have glanced over her account the last check but one paid her bill at lausanne but it was a large one and probably left her with cash in hand only one check has been drawn since
736414 to miss marie devine there is nothing to show where the check was drawn it was cashed at the credit lyonnais at montpellier less than three weeks ago the sum was fifty pounds
736415 that also i have been able to discover miss marie devine was the maid of lady frances carfax why she should have paid her this check we have not yet determined i have no doubt however that your researches will soon clear the matter up
736416 hence the health giving expedition to lausanne you know that i cannot possibly leave london while old abrahams is in such mortal terror of his life besides on general principles it is best that i should not leave the country scotland yard feels lonely without me and it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes go then my dear watson and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so extravagant a rate as two pence a word it waits your disposal night and day at the end of the continental wire
736417 you are not the only friend of lady frances carfax who is inquiring after her just now only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand
736418 none but he was an englishman though of an unusual type
736419 exactly that describes him very well he is a bulky bearded sunburned fellow who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers inn than in a fashionable hotel a hard fierce man i should think and one whom i should be sorry to offend
736420 the miscreant follows still there is the very man of whom i speak
736421 what have you done with her why have you pursued her i insist upon an answer
736422 a very pretty hash you have made of it i rather think you had better come back with me to london by the night express
736423 and a singularly consistent investigation you have made my dear watson
736424 i cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you have omitted the total effect of your proceeding has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing
736425 there is no perhaps about it i have done better here is the hon philip green who is a fellow lodger with you in this hotel and we may find him the starting point for a more successful investigation
736426 i had your note and i have come but what has this man to do with the matter
736427 this is my old friend and associate dr watson who is helping us in this affair
736428 i hope i didnt harm you when you accused me of hurting her i lost my grip of myself indeed im not responsible in these days my nerves are like live wires but this situation is beyond me what i want to know in the first place mr holmes is how in the world you came to hear of my existence at all
736429 i am in touch with miss dobney lady francess governess
736430 old susan dobney with the mob cap i remember her well
736431 and she remembers you it was in the days before before you found it better to go to south africa
736432 ah i see you know my whole story i need hide nothing from you i swear to you mr holmes that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than i had for frances i was a wild youngster i know not worse than others of my class but her mind was pure as snow she could not bear a shadow of coarseness so when she came to hear of things that i had done she would bave no more to say to me and yet she loved me that is the wonder of it loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone when the years had passed and i had made my money at barberton i thought perhaps i could seek her out and soften her i had heard that she was still unmarried i found her at lausanne and tried all i knew she weakened i think but her will was strong and when next i called she had left the town i traced her to baden and then after a time heard that her maid was here im a rough fellow fresh from a rough life and when dr watson spoke to me as he did i lost hold of myself for a moment but for gods sake tell me what has become of the lady frances
736433 then may i recommend that you return there and be on hand in case i should want you i have no desire to encourage false hopes but you may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of lady frances i can say no more for the instant i will leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us now watson if you will pack your bag i will cable to mrs hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7 30 to morrow
736434 you may remember my seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentlemans left ear you did not answer it
736435 exactly for this reason i sent a duplicate to the manager of the englischer hof whose answer lies here
736436 it shows my dear watson that we are dealing with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man the rev dr shlessinger missionary from south america is none other than holy peters one of the most unscrupulous rascals that australia has ever evolved and for a young country it has turned out some very finished types his particular specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings and his so called wife an englishwoman named fraser is a worthy helpmate the nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me and this physical peculiarity he was badly bitten in a saloon fight at adelaide in 89 confirmed my suspicion this poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple who will stick at nothing watson that she is already dead is a very likely supposition if not she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to miss dobney or her other friends it is always possible that she never reached london or that she has passed through it but the former is improbable as with their system of registration it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the continental police and the latter is also unlikely as these rogues could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a person under restraint all my instincts tell me that she is in london but as we have at present no possible means of telling where we can only take the obvious steps eat our dinner and possess our souls in patience later in the evening i will stroll down and have a word with friend lestrade at scotland yard
736437 he has begun to pawn the jewels we should get him now
736438 but does this mean that any harm has befallen the lady frances
736439 supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now it is clear that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction we must prepare for the worst
736440 it is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future in that case we must begin again on the other hand he has had a fair price and no questions asked so if he is in need of ready money he will probably come back to bovingtons i will give you a note to them and they will let you wait in the shop if the fellow comes you will follow him home but no indiscretion and above all no violence i put you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent
736441 she came only an hour ago it was the wife this time but the pendant she brought was the fellow of the other she is a tall pale woman with ferret eyes
736442 she left the office and i followed her she walked up the kennington road and i kept behind her presently she went into a shop mr holmes it was an undertakers
736443 she was talking to the woman behind the counter i entered as well it is late i heard her say or words to that effect the woman was excusing herself it should be there before now she answered it took longer being out of the ordinary they both stopped and looked at me so i asked some question and then left the shop
736444 the woman came out but i had hid myself in a doorway her suspicions had been aroused i think for she looked round her then she called a cab and got in i was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her she got down at last at no 36 poultney square brixton i drove past left my cab at the corner of the square and watched the house
736445 the windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor the blind was down and i could not see in i was standing there wondering what i should do next when a cov ered van drove up with two men in it they descended took something out of the van and carried it up the steps to the hall door mr holmes it was a coffin
736446 for an instant i was on the point of rushing in the door had been opened to admit the men and their burden it was the woman who had opened it but as i stood there she caught a glimpse of me and i think that she recognized me i saw her start and she hastily closed the door i remembered my promise to you and here i am
736447 we can do nothing legal without a warrant and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and getting one there may be some difficulty but i should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient lestrade will see to all details
736448 but they may murder her in the meanwhile what could the coffin mean and for whom could it be but for her
736449 we will do all that can be done mr green not a moment will be lost leave it in our hands now watson
736450 these villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to lon don after first alienating her from her faithful maid if she has written any letters they have been intercepted through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house once inside it they have made her a prisoner and they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first already they have begun to sell part of it which seems safe enough to them since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in the ladys fate when she is released she will of course denounce them therefore she must not be released but they cannot keep her under lock and key forever so murder is their only solution
736451 now we will take another line of reasoning when you follow two separate chains of thought watson you will find some point of intersection which should approximate to the truth we will start now not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward that incident proves i fear beyond all doubt that the lady is dead it points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanc tion had the lady been obviously murdered they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden but here all is open and regular what does that mean surely that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a natural end poisoning perhaps and yet how strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confeder ate which is hardly a credible proposition
736452 dangerous watson very dangerous no i hardly see them doing that pull up cabby this is evidently the undertakers for we have just passed the pawnbrokers would you go in wat son your appearance inspires confidence ask what hour the poultney square funeral takes place to morrow
736453 you see watson no mystery everything aboveboard in some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with and they think that they have little to fear well theres nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack are you armed
736454 well well we shall be strong enough thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just we simply cant afford to wait for the police or to keep within the four corners of the law you can drive off cabby now watson well just take our luck to gether as we have occasionally done in the past
736455 well i want to see the man who lives here whatever he may call himself
736456 my husband is not afraid to face any man in the world
736457 you are henry peters of adelaide late the rev dr shlessinger of baden and south america i am as sure of that as that my own name is sherlock holmes
736458 i guess your name does not frighten me mr holmes
736459 when a mans conscience is easy you cant rattle him what is your business in my house
736460 i want to know what you have done with the lady frances carfax whom you brought away with you from baden
736461 id be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be
736462 ive a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer would hardly look at she attached herself to mrs peters and me at baden it is a fact that i was using another name at the time and she stuck on to us until we came to london i paid her bill and her ticket once in london she gave us the slip and as i say left these out of date jewels to pay her bills you find her mr holmes and im your debtor
736463 im going through this house till i do find her
736464 this will have to serve till a better one comes
736465 my companion is also a dangerous ruffian and together we are going through your house
736466 if you try to stop us peters you will most certainly get hurt where is that coffin which was brought into your house
736467 what do you want with the coffin it is in use there is a body in it
736468 well if you really must know she is an old nurse of my wifes rose spender by name whom we found in the brixton workhouse infirmary we brought her round here called in dr horsom of 13 firbank villas mind you take the address mr holmes and had her carefully tended as christian folk should on the third day she died certificate says senile decay but thats only the doctors opinion and of course you know better we ordered her funeral to be carried out by stimson and co of the kennington road who will bury her at eight oclock to morrow morning can you pick any hole in that mr holmes youve made a silly blunder and you may as well own up to it id give something for a photograph of your gaping staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the lady frances carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety
736469 well soon see about that this way officers if you please these men have forced their way into my house and i cannot get rid of them help me to put them out
736470 this is my name and address this is my friend dr watson
736471 we know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted
736472 i expect there was good reason for your presence there if
736473 its a missing lady sergeant and we think she is in that house i expect a warrant presently
736474 then ill keep my eye on the parties mr holmes if any thing comes along i will surely let you know
736475 i assure you that everything was perfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter
736476 well it is 7 20 now good heavens watson what has become of any brains that god has given me quick man quick its life or death a hundred chances on death to one on life ill never forgive myself never if we are too late
736477 what the devil do you mean once again i ask you where is your warrant
736478 the warrant is on its way this coffin shall remain in the house until it comes
736479 heres one for you my man a sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute ask no questions work away thats good another and another now pull all together its giving its giving ah that does it at last
736480 is she gone watson is there a spark left surely we are not too late
736481 he will find that his birds have flown and here
736482 is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have good morning mr green i think that the sooner we can move the lady frances the better meanwhile the funeral may proceed and the poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last resting place alone
736483 should you care to add the case to your annals my dear watson
736484 it was a desperate chance that we might find her alive but it was a chance as the result showed these people had never to my knowledge done a murder they might shrink from actual violence at the last they could bury her with no sign of how she met her end and even if she were exhumed there was a chance for them i hoped that such considerations might prevail with them you can reconstruct the scene well enough you saw the horrible den upstairs where the poor lady had been kept so long they rushed in and overpowered her with their chloro form carried her down poured more into the coffin to insure against her waking and then screwed down the lid a clever device watson it is new to me in the annals of crime if our ex missionary friends escape the clutches of lestrade i shall expect to hear of some brilliant incidents in their future career
736485 for three days he has been sinking and i doubt if he will last the day he would not let me get a doctor this morning when i saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me i could stand no more of it with your leave or without it mr holmes i am going for a doctor this very hour said i let it be watson then said he i wouldnt waste an hour in coming to him sir or you may not see him alive
736486 there is little i can tell you sir he has been working at a case down at rotherhithe in an alley near the river and he has brought this illness back with him he took to his bed on wednesday afternoon and has never moved since for these three days neither food nor drink has passed his lips
736487 good god why did you not call in a doctor
736488 he wouldnt have it sir you know how masterful he is i didnt dare to disobey him but hes not long for this world as youll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him
736489 well watson we seem to have fallen upon evil days
736490 if you approach me watson i shall order you out of the house
736491 exactly you will help best by doing what you are told
736492 i know what is the matter with me it is a coolie disease from sumatra a thing that the dutch know more about than we though they have made little of it up to date one thing only is certain it is infallibly deadly and it is horribly contagious
736493 contagious by touch watson thats it by touch keep your distance and all is well
736494 good heavens holmes do you suppose that such a consid eration weighs with me for an instant it would not affect me in the case of a stranger do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend
736495 if you will stand there i will talk if you do not you must leave the room
736496 you are not yourself a sick man is but a child and so i will treat you whether you like it or not i will examine your symptoms and treat you for them
736497 if i am to have a doctor whether i will or not let me at least have someone in whom i have confidence
736498 in your friendship certainly but facts are facts watson and after all you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications it is painful to have to say these things but you leave me no choice
736499 such a remark is unworthy of you holmes it shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves but if you have no confidence in me i would not intrude my services let me bring sir jasper meek or penrose fisher or any of the best men in london but someone you must have and that is final if you think that i am going to stand here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to help you then you have mistaken your man
736500 shall i demonstrate your own ignorance what do you know pray of tapanuli fever what do you know of the black formosa corruption
736501 there are many problems of disease many strange patholog ical possibilities in the east watson
736502 i have learned so much during some recent researches which have a medico criminal aspect it was in the course of them that i contracted this complaint you can do nothing
736503 possibly not but i happen to know that dr ainstree the greatest living authority upon tropical disease is now in london all remonstrance is useless holmes i am going this instant to fetch him
736504 you wont take the key from me by force watson ive got you my friend here you are and here you will stay until i will otherwise but ill humour you
736505 youve only my own good at heart of course i know that very well you shall have your way but give me time to get my strength not now watson not now its four oclock at six you can go
736506 only two hours watson i promise you will go at six are you content to wait
736507 none in the world watson thank you i need no help in arranging the clothes you will please keep your distance now watson there is one other condition that i would make you will seek help not from the man you mention but from the one that i choose
736508 the first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room watson you will find some books over there i am somewhat exhausted i wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non conductor at six watson we resume our conversation
736509 put it down down this instant watson this instant i say
736510 i hate to have my things touched watson you know that i hate it you fidget me beyond endurance you a doctor you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum sit down man and let me have my rest
736511 ah too few too few how very unfortunate watson however such as they are you can put them in your watchpocket and all the rest of your money in your left trouserpocket thank you it will balance you so much better like that
736512 you will now light the gas watson but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on i implore you to be careful watson thank you that is excellent no you need not draw the blind now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach thank you now some of that litter from the mantel piece excellent watson there is a sugar tongs there kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance place it here among the papers good you can now go and fetch mr culverton smith of 13 lower burke street
736513 possibly not my good watson it may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man but a planter mr culverton smith is a well known resident of sumatra now visiting london an outbreak of the disease upon his plantation which was distant from medical aid caused him to study it himself with some rather far reaching consequences he is a very methodical person and i did not desire you to start before six because i was well aware that you would not find him in his study if you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experi ence of this disease the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby i cannot doubt that he could help me
736514 you will tell him exactly how you have left me
736515 you will convey the very impression which is in your own mind a dying man a dying and delirious man indeed i can not think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters so prolific the creatures seem ah i am wandering strange how the brain controls the brain what was i saying watson
736516 ah yes i remember my life depends upon it plead with him watson there is no good feeling between us his nephew watson i had suspicions of foul play and i allowed him to see it the boy died horribly he has a grudge against me you will soften him watson beg him pray him get him here by any means he can save me only he
736517 i will bring him in a cab if i have to carry him down to it
736518 you will do nothing of the sort you will persuade him to come and then you will return in front of him make any excuse so as not to come with him dont forget watson you wont fail me you never did fail me no doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures you and i watson we have done our part shall the world then be overrun by oysters no no horrible youll convey all that is in your mind
736519 yes mr culverton smith is in dr watson very good sir i will take up your card
736520 who is this person what does he want dear me staples how often have i said that i am not to be disturbed in my hours of study
736521 well i wont see him staples i cant have my work inter rupted like this i am not at home say so tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me
736522 well well give him that message he can come in the morning or he can stay away my work must not be hindered
736523 what is the meaning of this intrusion didnt i send you word that i would see you to morrow morning
736524 he is desperately ill that is why i have come
736525 i only know mr holmes through some business dealings which we have had but i have every respect for his talents and his character he is an amateur of crime as i am of disease for him the villain for me the microbe there are my prisons
736526 among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time
736527 it was on account of your special knowledge that mr holmes desired to see you he has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in london who could help him
736528 why should mr holmes think that i could help him in his trouble
736529 but why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is eastern
736530 because in some professional inquiry he has been working among chinese sailors down in the docks
736531 i trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose how long has he been ill
736532 tut tut this sounds serious it would be inhuman not to answer his call i very much resent any interruption to my work dr watson but this case is certainly exceptional i will come with you at once
736533 very good i will go alone i have a note of mr holmess address you can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most
736534 admirable watson admirable you are the best of mes sengers
736535 that would never do watson that would be obviously impossible did he ask what ailed me
736536 i told him about the chinese in the east end
736537 exactly well watson you have done all that a good friend could you can now disappear from the scene
736538 of course you must but i have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone there is just room behind the head of my bed watson
736539 i fear there is no alternative watson the room does not lend itself to concealment which is as well as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion but just there watson i fancy that it could be done
736540 there are the wheels watson quick man if you love me and dont budge whatever happens whatever happens do you hear dont speak dont move just listen with all your ears
736541 and yet you see i am here coals of fire holmes coals of fire
736542 it is very good of you very noble of you i appreciate your special knowledge
736543 you do you are fortunately the only man in london who does do you know what is the matter with you
736544 well i shouldnt be surprised holmes i shouldnt be sur prised if it were the same a bad lookout for you if it is poor victor was a dead man on the fourth day a strong hearty young fellow it was certainly as you said very surprising that he should have contracted an out of the way asiatic disease in the heart of london a disease too of which i had made such a very special study singular coincidence holmes very smart of you to notice it but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect
736545 oh you did did you well you couldnt prove it anyhow but what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble what sort of a game is that eh
736546 youre precious near your end my friend but i dont want you to go till i have had a word with you thats why i give you water there dont slop it about thats right can you under stand what i say
736547 do what you can for me let bygones be bygones
736548 ill put the words out of my head i swear i will only cure me and ill forget it
736549 well about victor savages death you as good as admitted just now that you had done it ill forget it
736550 you can forget it or remember it just as you like i dont see you in the witness box quite another shaped box my good holmes i assure you it matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died its not him we are talking about its you
736551 the fellow who came for me ive forgotten his name said that you contracted it down in the east end among the sailors
736552 you are proud of your brains holmes are you not think yourself smart dont you you came across someone who was smarter this time now cast your mind back holmes can you think of no other way you could have got this thing
736553 i cant think my mind is gone for heavens sake help
736554 yes i will help you ill help you to understand just where you are and how you got there id like you to know before you die
736555 painful is it yes the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end takes you as cramp i fancy
736556 well you can hear what i say anyhow listen now can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began
736557 well then ill help you did anything come by post
736558 you must hear me you shall hear me do you remember a box an ivory box it came on wednesday you opened it do you remember
736559 yes yes i opened it there was a sharp spring inside it
736560 it was no joke as you will find to your cost you fool you would have it and you have got it who asked you to cross my path if you had left me alone i would not have hurt you
736561 the spring it drew blood this box this on the table
736562 the very one by george and it may as well leave the room in my pocket there goes your last shred of evidence but you have the truth now holmes and you can die with the knowledge that i killed you you knew too much of the fate of victor savage so i have sent you to share it you are very near your end holmes i will sit here and i will watch you die
736563 turn up the gas ah the shadows begin to fall do they yes i will turn it up that i may see you the better
736564 is there any other little service that i can do you my friend
736565 the best way of successfully acting a part is to be it
736566 i give you my word that for three days i have tasted neither food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water but it is the tobacco which i find most irksome ah here are some cigarettes
736567 that is very much better halloa halloa do i hear the step of a friend
736568 i arrest you on the charge of the murder of one victor savage
736569 and you might add of the attempted murder of one sherlock holmes
736570 to save an invalid trouble inspector mr culverton smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas by the way the prisoner has a small box in the right hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove thank you i would handle it gingerly if i were you put it down here it may play its part in the trial
736571 it will bring you into the dock holmes not me he asked me to come here to cure him i was sorry for him and i came now he will pretend no doubt that i have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions you can lie as you like holmes my word is always as good as yours
736572 however as you know my habits are irregular and such a feat means less to me than to most men it was very essential that i should impress mrs hudson with the reality of my condition since she was to convey it to you and you in turn to him you wont be offended watson you will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress smith with the urgent necessity of his presence which was the vital point of the whole scheme knowing his vindictive nature i was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork
736573 three days of absolute fast does not improve ones beauty watson for the rest there is nothing which a sponge may not cure with vaseline upon ones forehead belladonna in ones eyes rouge over the cheek bones and crusts of beeswax round ones lips a very satisfying effect can be produced malingering is a subject upon which i have sometimes thought of writing a monograph a little occasional talk about half crowns oysters or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium
736574 but why would you not let me near you since there was in truth no infection
736575 can you ask my dear watson do you imagine that i have no respect for your medical talents could i fancy that your astute judgment would pass a dying man who however weak had no rise of pulse or temperature at four yards i could deceive you if i failed to do so who would bring my smith within my grasp no watson i would not touch that box you can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a vipers tooth emerges as you open it i dare say it was by some such device that poor savage who stood between this monster and a reversion was done to death my correspon dence however is as you know a varied one and i am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me it was clear to me however that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design i might surprise a con fession that pretence i have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist thank you watson you must help me on with my coat when we have finished at the police station i think that something nutritious at simpsons would not be out of place
736576 so far as i can judge the trend of events you will probably be back in berlin within the week
736577 when you get there my dear von bork i think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive i happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country
736578 they have strange limits and one must learn to observe them it is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger ones first impression is that they are entirely soft then one comes suddenly upon something very hard and you know that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the fact they have for example their insular conventions which simply must be observed
736579 meaning british prejudice in all its queer manifestations as an example i may quote one of my own worst blunders i can afford to talk of my blunders for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes it was on my first arrival i was invited to a week end gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister the conversation was amazingly indiscreet
736580 exactly well i naturally sent a resume of the information to berlin
736581 no no dont call it a pose a pose is an artificial thing this is quite natural i am a born sportsman i enjoy it
736582 well that makes it the more effective you yacht against them you hunt with them you play polo you match them in every game your four in hand takes the prize at olympia i have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers what is the result nobody takes you seriously you are a good old sport quite a decent fellow for a german a hard drinking night club knock about town devil may care young fellow and all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in england and the sporting squire the most astute secret service man in europe genius my dear von borkqgenius
736583 you flatter me baron but certainly i may claim that my four years in this country have not been unproductive ive never shown you my little store would you mind stepping in for a moment
736584 when my wife and the household left yesterday for flushing they took the less important with them i must of course claim the protection of the embassy for the others
736585 your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite there will be no difficulties for you or your baggage of course it is just possible that we may not have to go england may leave france to her fate we are sure that there is no binding treaty between them
736586 i dont see how that could be there is a definite treaty there she could never recover from such a humiliation
736587 tut my dear sir we live in a utilitarian age honour is a mediaeval conception besides england is not ready it is an inconceivable thing but even our special war tax of fifty million which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the times has not roused these people from their slumbers here and there one hears a question it is my business to find an answer here and there also there is an irritation it is my business to soothe it but i can assure you that so far as the essentials go the storage of munitions the preparation for submarine attack the arrangements for making high explosives nothing is prepared how then can england come in especially when we have stirred her up such a devils brew of irish civil war window breaking furies and god knows what to keep her thoughts at home
736588 ah that is another matter i fancy that in the future we have our own very definite plans about england and that your information will be very vital to us it is to day or to morrow with mr john bull if he prefers to day we are perfectly ready if it is to morrow we shall be more ready still i should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them but that is their own affair this week is their week of destiny but you were speaking of your papers
736589 and all in four years baron not such a bad show for the hard drinking hard riding country squire but the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it
736590 out of date and waste paper the admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed it was a blow baron the worst setback in my whole campaign but thanks to my check book and the good altamont all will be well to night
736591 well i really can wait no longer you can imagine that things are moving at present in carlton terrace and that we have all to be at our posts i had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup did altamont name no hour
736592 you see he poses as a motor expert and i keep a full garage in our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part if he talks of a radiator it is a battleship of an oil pump a cruiser and so on sparking plugs are naval signals
736593 five hundred pounds for this particular job of course he has a salary as well
736594 the greedy rogue they are useful these traitors but i grudge them their blood money
736595 i grudge altamont nothing he is a wonderful worker if i pay him well at least he delivers the goods to use his own phrase besides he is not a traitor i assure you that our most pan germanic junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards england as compared with a real bitter irish american
736596 if you heard him talk you would not doubt it sometimes i assure you i can hardly understand him he seems to have declared war on the kings english as well as on the english king must you really go he may be here any moment
736597 no im sorry but i have already overstayed my time we shall expect you early to morrow and when you get that signal book through the little door on the duke of yorks steps you can put a triumphant finis to your record in england what tokay
736598 altamont has a nice taste in wines and he took a fancy to my tokay he is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things i have to study him i assure you
736599 how still and peaceful it all seems there may be other lights within the week and the english coast a less tranquil place the heavens too may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good zeppelin promises us comes true by the way who is that
736600 with her complete self absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence well au revoir von bork
736601 you can give me the glad hand to night mister
736602 same as i said in my cable every last one of them semaphore lamp code marconi a copy mind you not the original that was too dangerous but its the real goods and you can lay to that
736603 im all alone in the house i was only waiting for this of course a copy is better than the original if an original were missing they would change the whole thing you think its all safe about the copy
736604 you dont tell me you keep your papers in that
736605 gosh in a wide open contraption like that and they reckon you to be some spy why a yankee crook would be into that with a can opener if id known that any letter of mine was goin to lie loose in a thing like that id have been a mug to write to you at all
736606 no its a double combination lock you know what that is
736607 well you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the lock to work
736608 this outer one is for the letters thel inner one for the figures
736609 so its not quite as simple as you thought it was four years ago that i had it made and what do you think i chose for the word and figures
736610 well i chose august for the word and 1914 for the figures and here we are
736611 my but that was smart you had it down to a fine thing
736612 yes a few of us even then could have guessed the date here it is and im
736613 well i guess youll have to fix me up also im not staying in this gol darned country all on my lonesome in a week or less from what i see john bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping id rather watch him from over the water
736614 well so was jack james an american citizen but hes doing time in portland all the same it cuts no ice with a british copper to tell him youre an american citizen its british law and order over here says he by the way mister talking of jack james it seems to me you dont do much to cover your men
736615 well you are their employer aint you its up to you to see that they
736616 it was jamess own fault you know that yourself he was too self willed for the job
736617 well he went a bit woozy towards the end its enough to make a man
736618 well theyve got him thats all they raided his store last night and he and his papers are all in portsmouth jail youll go off and he poor devil will have to stand the racket and lucky if he gets off with his life thats why i want to get over the water as soon as you do
736619 well you nearly had a worse one for i believe they are not far off me
736620 sure thing my landlady down fratton way had some inquiries and when i heard of it i guessed it was time for me to hustle but what i want to know mister is how the coppers know these things steiner is the fifth man youve lost since i signed on with you and i know the name of the sixth if i dont get a move on how do you explain it and aint you ashamed to see your men go down like this
736621 if i didnt dare things mister i wouldnt be in your service but ill tell you straight what is in my mind ive heard that with you german politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to see him put away
736622 do you dare to suggest that i have given away my own agents
736623 i dont stand for that mister but theres a stool pigeon or a cross somewhere and its up to you to find out where it is anyhow i am taking no more chances its me for little holland and the sooner the better
736624 we have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of victory
736625 youve done splendid work and taken risks and i cant forget it by all means go to holland and you can get a boat from rotterdam to new york no other line will be safe a week from now ill take that book and pack it with the rest
736626 the boodle the reward the 500 pounds the gunner turned damned nasty at
736627 you dont seem to have a very high opinion of my honour
736628 you want the money before you give up the book
736629 after all since we are to be on such terms mr altamont
736630 i dont see why i should trust you any more than you trust me do you understand
736631 theres the check upon the table i claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up
736632 a remarkable wine watson our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from franz josefs special cellar at the schoenbrunn palace might i trouble you to open the window for chloroform vapour does not help the palate
736633 we need not hurry ourselves watson we are safe from interruption would you mind touching the bell there is no one in the house except old martha who has played her part to admiration i got her the situation here when first i took the matter up ah martha you will be glad to hear that all is well
736634 it is all right martha he has not been hurt at all
736635 i am glad of that mr holmes according to his lights he has been a kind master he wanted me to go with his wife to germany yesterday but that would hardly have suited your plans would it sir
736636 no indeed martha so long as you were here i was easy in my mind we waited some time for your signal to night
736637 i thought he would never go i knew that it would not suit your plans sir to find him here
736638 no indeed well it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until i saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear you can report to me to morrow in london martha at claridges hotel
736639 yes sir he posted seven letters to day i have the addresses as usual
736640 very good martha i will look into them to morrow good night these papers
736641 are not of very great imponance for of course the information which they represent has been sent off long ago to the german government these are the originals which could not safely be got out of the country
736642 i should not go so far as to say that watson they will at least show our people what is known and what is not i may say that a good many of these papers have come tbrough me and i need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy it would brighten my declining years to see a german cruiser navigating the solent according to the mine field plans which i have furnished but you watson
736643 ive hardly seen you in the light yet how have
736644 i feel twenty years younger holmes i have seldom felt so happy as when i got your wire asking me to meet you at harwich with the car but you holmes you have changed very little save for that horrible goatee
736645 these are the sacrifices one makes for ones country watson
736646 to morrow it will be but a dreadful memory with my hair cut and a few other superficial changes i shall no doubt reappear at claridges tomorrow as i was before this american stunt i beg your pardon watson my well of english seems to be permanently defiled before this american job came my way
736647 but you have retired holmes we heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the south downs
736648 exactly watson here is the fruit of my leisured ease the magnum opus of my latter years
736649 alone i did it behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when i watched the little working gangs as once i watched the criminal world of london
736650 ah i have often marvelled at it myself the foreign minister alone i could have withstood but when the premier also deigned to visit my humble roof the fact is watson that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people he was in a class by himself things were going wrong and no one could understand why they were going wrong agents were suspected or even caught but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force it was absolutely necessary to expose it strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter it has cost me two years watson but they have not been devoid of excitement when i say that i started my pilgrimage at chicago graduated in an irish secret society at buffalo gave serious trouble to the constabulary at skibbareen and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of von bork who recommended me as a likely man you will realize that the matter was complex since then i have been honoured by his confidence which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison i watched them watson and i picked them as they ripened well sir i hope that you are none the worse
736651 though unmusical german is the most expressive of all languages
736652 this should put another bird in the cage i had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal though i have long had an eye upon him mister von bork you have a great deal to answer for
736653 if it takes me all my life i shall get level with you
736654 how often have i heard it in days gone by it was a favourite ditty of the late lamented professor moriarty colonel sebastian moran has also been known to warble it and yet i live and keep bees upon the south downs
736655 as my speech surely shows you mr altamont af chicago had no existence in fact i used him and he is gone
736656 it is really immaterial who i am but since the matter seems to interest you mr von bork i may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the members of your family i have done a good deal of business in germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to you
736657 it was i who brought about the separation between irene adler and the late
736658 what is it worth what have i done it is my ruin forever
736659 it will require some checking and you have little time to check it your admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects and the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster
736660 there are a good many other points of defail which will no doubt come to light in good time but youl have one quality which is very rare in a german mr von bork you are a sportsman and you will bear me no ill will when you realize that you who have outwitted so many other people have at last been outwitted yourself after all you have done vour best for your country and i have done my best for mine and what could be more natural besides
736661 it is better than to fall before some more ignoble foe these papers are now ready watson if you will help me with our prisoner i think that we may get started for london at once
736662 i trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit
736663 should i be guilty of a liberty if i lit a cigar and placed it between your lips
736664 that if your government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war
736665 you are a private individual you have no warrant for my arrest the whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous
736666 well you realize your position you and your accomplice here if i were to
736667 my dear sir if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us the dangling prussian as a signpost the englishman is a patient creature but at present his temper is a little inflamed and it would be as well not to try him too far no mr von bork you will go with us in a quiet sensible fashion to scotland yard whence you can send for your friend baron von herling and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite as to you watson you are joining us with your old service as i understand so london wont be out of your way stand with me here upon the terrace for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have
736668 good old watson you are the one fixed point in a changing age theres an
736669 i was thinking mr malone that we could employ you to advantage these days i was thinking there was a story that you are the only man that could handle as it should be handled
736670 of course if i am needed there is an end of the matter but
736671 well it was just to interview that deevil of a man down at rotherfield
736672 aye its just him that i do mean he ran young alec simpson of the courier a mile down the high road last week by the collar of his coat and the slack of his breeches youll have read of it likely in the police report our boys would as soon interview a loose alligator in the zoo but you could do it im thinking an old friend like you
736673 this makes it all easy it so happens that it was to visit professor challenger at rotherfield that i was asking for leave of absence the fact is that it is the anniversary of our main adventure on the plateau three years ago and he has asked our whole party down to his house to see him and celebrate the occasion
736674 then you will be able to get his opeenions out of him in any other man i would say it was all moonshine but the fellow has made good once and who knows but he may again
736675 havent you seen his letter on scientific possibeelities in times
736676 id be glad to hear it again for i am not sure now that i have the mans meaning clear in my head
736677 sir i have read with amusement not wholly unmixed with some less complimentary emotion the complacent and wholly fatuous letter of james wilson macphail which has lately appeared in your columns upon the subject of the blurring of fraunhofers lines in the spectra both of the planets and of the fixed stars he dismisses the matter as of no significance to a wider intelligence it may well seem of very great possible importance so great as to involve the ultimate welfare of every man woman and child upon this planet i can hardly hope by the use of scientific language to convey any sense of my meaning to those ineffectual people who gather their ideas from the columns of a daily newspaper i will endeavour therefore to condescend to their limitation and to indicate the situation by the use of a homely analogy which will be within the limits of the intelligence of your readers
736678 hed put up the feathers of a sucking dove and set up a riot in a quakers meeting no wonder he has made london too hot for him its a peety mr malone for its a grand brain well lets have the analogy
736679 that a small bundle of connected corks was launched in a sluggish current upon a voyage across the atlantic the corks drift slowly on from day to day with the same conditions all round them if the corks were sentient we could imagine that they would consider these conditions to be permanent and assured but we with our superior knowledge know that many things might happen to surprise the corks they might possibly float up against a ship or a sleeping whale or become entangled in seaweed in any case their voyage would probably end by their being thrown up on the rocky coast of labrador but what could they know of all this while they drifted so gently day by day in what they thought was a limitless and homogeneous ocean your readers will possibly comprehend that the atlantic in this parable stands for the mighty ocean of ether through which we drift and that the bunch of corks represents the little and obscure planetary system to which we belong a third rate sun with its rag tag and bobtail of insignificant satellites we float under the same daily conditions towards some unknown end some squalid catastrophe which will overwhelm us at the ultimate confines of space where we are swept over an etheric niagara or dashed upon some unthinkable labrador i see no room here for the shallow and ignorant optimism of your correspondent mr james wilson macphail but many reasons why we should watch with a very close and interested attention every indication of change in those cosmic surroundings upon which our own ultimate fate may depend
736680 it just booms like an organ lets get doun to what it is thats troubling him
736681 the colours are just light itself every light if you can split it up with a prism gives the same colours they tell us nothing it is the lines that count because they vary according to what it may be that produces the light it is these lines that have been blurred instead of clear this last week and all the astronomers have been quarreling over the reason heres a photograph of the blurred lines for our issue to morrow the public have taken no interest in the matter up to now but this letter of challengers in the times will make them wake up im thinking
736682 well its a long cry from a blurred line in a spectrum to a sick nigger in sumatra and yet the chiel has shown us once before that he knows what hes talking about there is some queer illness down yonder thats beyond all doubt and to day theres a cable just come in from singapore that the lighthouses are out of action in the straits of sundan and two ships on the beach in consequence anyhow its good enough for you to interview challenger upon if you get anything definite let us have a column by monday
736683 dont tell me that you have had one of these preposterous telegrams for oxygen
736684 well well i have had one too and as you see very much against the grain i have acted upon it our good friend is as impossible as ever the need for oxygen could not have been so urgent that he must desert the usual means of supply and encroach upon the time of those who are really busier than himself why could he not order it direct
736685 or thought he did which is quite another matter but it is superfluous now for you to purchase any since i have this considerable supply
736686 still for some reason he seems to wish that i should bring oxygen too it will be safer to do exactly what he tells me
736687 mine is in the van whatever can the old dear be after
736688 well its at the bottom of this oxygen business or i am mistaken
736689 no one can deny it its a fool that denies it look at his hat theres a sixty ounce brain inside it a big engine running smooth and turning out clean work show me the engine house and ill tell you the size of the engine but he is a born charlatan youve heard me tell him so to his face a born charlatan with a kind of dramatic trick of jumping into the limelight things are quiet so friend challenger sees a chance to set the public talking about him you dont imagine that he seriously believes all this nonsense about a change in the ether and a danger to the human race was ever such a cock and bull story in this life
736690 you had a scrap once before with old man challenger
736691 and you were down and out inside ten seconds it seems to me professor summerlee hes beyond your class and the best you can do with him is to walk wide and leave him alone
736692 he has been a good friend to every one of us whatever his faults may be he is as straight as a line and i dont believe he ever speaks evil of his comrades behind their backs
736693 come herr professor were not going to quarrel at this time of day weve seen too much together but keep off the grass when you get near challenger for this young fellah and i have a bit of a weakness for the old dear
736694 your opinion upon a matter of science is of as much value in my eyes as my views upon a new type of shot gun would be in yours i have my own judgment sir and i use it in my own way because it has misled me once is that any reason why i should accept without criticism anything however far fetched which this man may care to put forward are we to have a pope of science with infallible decrees laid down ex cathedra and accepted without question by the poor humble public i tell you sir that i have a brain of my own and that i should feel myself to be a snob and a slave if i did not use it if it pleases you to believe this rigmarole about ether and fraunhofers lines upon the spectrum do so by all means but do not ask one who is older and wiser than yourself to share in your folly is it not evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he maintains and if it were obnoxious to human health the result of it would already be apparent upon ourselves
736695 yes sir we should already be very far from our normal selves and instead of sitting quietly discussing scientific problems in a railway train we should be showing actual symptoms of the poison which was working within us where do we see any signs of this poisonous cosmic disturbance answer me that sir answer me that come come no evasion i pin you to an answer
736696 i think that if you knew more about the facts you might be less positive in your opinion
736697 pray what do you mean sir by that somewhat impertinent observation
736698 i mean that when i was leaving the office the news editor told me that a telegram had come in confirming the general illness of the sumatra natives and adding that the lights had not been lit in the straits of sunda
736699 is it possible that you do not realize that ether if for a moment we adopt challengers preposterous supposition is a universal substance which is the same here as at the other side of the world do you for an instant suppose that there is an english ether and a sumatran ether perhaps you imagine that the ether of kent is in some way superior to the ether of surrey through which this train is now bearing us there really are no bounds to the credulity and ignorance of the average layman is it conceivable that the ether in sumatra should be so deadly as to cause total insensibility at the very time when the ether here has had no appreciable effect upon us whatever personally i can truly say that i never felt stronger in body or better balanced in mind in my life
736700 that may be i dont profess to be a scientific man
736701 though i have heard somewhere that the science of one generation is usually the fallacy of the next but it does not take much common sense to see that as we seem to know so little about ether it might be affected by some local conditions in various parts of the world and might show an effect over there which would only develop later with us
736702 pigs may fly yes sir pigs may fly but they dont it is not worth arguing with you challenger has filled you with his nonsense and you are both incapable of reason i had as soon lay arguments before those railway cushions
736703 i must say professor summerlee that your manners do not seem to have improved since i last had the pleasure of meeting you
736704 it comes as a bit of a shock does it not when someone makes you realize that your title leaves you none the less a very ignorant man
736705 if you were a younger man you would not dare to speak to me in so offensive a fashion
736706 i would have you know sir that young or old there has never been a time in my life when i was afraid to speak my mind to an ignorant coxcomb yes sir an ignorant coxcomb if you had as many titles as slaves could invent and fools could adopt
736707 your habits sir have not mended in these three years
736708 i also did not fail to observe your strange manner the moment we met you need not waste your sympathy lord john these tears are purely alcoholic the man has been drinking by the way lord john i called you a coxcomb just now which was perhaps unduly severe but the word reminds me of a small accomplishment trivial but amusing which i used to possess you know me as the austere man of science can you believe that i once had a well deserved reputation in several nurseries as a farmyard imitator perhaps i can help you to pass the time in a pleasant way would it amuse you to hear me crow like a cock
736709 my imitation of the clucking hen who had just laid an egg was also considered rather above the average might i venture
736710 if i was to go who would look after im
736711 not e no one would stay a week if i was to go that ouse would run down like a watch with the mainspring out im telling you because youre is friend and you ought to know if i was to take im at is word but there i wouldnt have the eart e and the missus would be like two babes left out in a bundle im just everything and then e goes and gives me notice
736712 well they wouldnt make allowances same as i do es a very clever man the master so clever that es clean balmy sometimes ive seen im right off is onion and no error well look what e did this morning
736713 yes sir bit er on the leg i saw er with my own eyes startin a marathon from the all door
736714 so youd say sir if you could see some of the goings on e dont make friends with the neighbors theres some of them thinks that when e was up among those monsters you wrote about it was just ome sweet ome for the master and e was never in fitter company thats what they say but ive served im ten years and im fond of im and mind you es a great man when alls said an done and its an honor to serve im but e does try one cruel at times now look at that sir that aint what you might call old fashioned ospitality is it now just you read it for yourself
736715 it wouldnt look well in a christmas card i beg your pardon sir for i havent spoke as much as this for many a long year but to day my feelings seem to ave got the better of me e can sack me till es blue in the face but i aint going and thats flat im is man and es my master and so it will be i expect to the end of the chapter
736716 here are our visitors it is something new for us to have visitors is it not no love lost between us and our neighbors is there if they could get rat poison into our bakers cart i expect it would be there
736717 george is always quarreling with everyone we havent a friend on the countryside
736718 it enables me to concentrate my attention upon my incomparable wife
736719 come come these gentlemen are tired from the journey and luncheon should be ready has sarah returned
736720 when you have put up the car you will kindly help your mistress to lay the lunch now gentlemen will you please step into my study for there are one or two very urgent things which i am anxious to say to you
736721 yes yes of course it is i yes certainly the professor challenger the famous professor who else of course every word of it otherwise i should not have written it i shouldnt be surprised there is every indication of it within a day or so at the furthest well i cant help that can i very unpleasant no doubt but i rather fancy it will affect more important people than you there is no use whining about it no i couldnt possibly you must take your chance thats enough sir nonsense i have something more important to do than to listen to such twaddle
736722 i begin to think that it would save my correspondents money if i were to adopt a telegraphic address possibly noah rotherfield would be the most appropriate
736723 this is indeed an interesting reunion and it takes place under extraordinary i may say unprecedented circumstances may i ask if you have observed anything upon your journey from town
736724 was that our young friend here has not improved in his manners during the years that have passed i am sorry to state that i have had to seriously complain of his conduct in the train and i should be wanting in frankness if i did not say that it has left a most unpleasant impression in my mind
736725 the young fellah meant no real harm after all hes an international so if he takes half an hour to describe a game of football he has more right to do it than most folk
736726 why it was you that took half an hour with some long winded story about a buffalo professor summerlee will be my witness
736727 i can hardly judge which of you was the most utterly wearisome
736728 i declare to you challenger that i never wish to hear of football or of buffaloes so long as i live
736729 i have never said one word to day about football
736730 why you were doin a music hall turn of imitations all the way more like a runaway gramophone than a man
736731 each of us seems to know what the others did and none of us knows what he did himself lets put it all together from the first we got into a first class smoker thats clear aint it then we began to quarrel over friend challengers letter in the times
736732 you said summerlee that there was no possible truth in his contention
736733 no possible truth i seem to have heard the words before and may i ask with what arguments the great and famous professor summerlee proceeded to demolish the humble individual who had ventured to express an opinion upon a matter of scientific possibility perhaps before he exterminates that unfortunate nonentity he will condescend to give some reasons for the adverse views which he has formed
736734 i contended that if the ether surrounding the earth was so toxic in one quarter that it produced dangerous symptoms it was hardly likely that we three in the railway carriage should be entirely unaffected
736735 our worthy summerlee is not for the first time somewhat out of touch with the facts of the situation
736736 now gentlemen i cannot make my point better than by detailing to you what i have myself done this morning you will the more easily condone any mental abberation upon your own part when you realize that even i have had moments when my balance has been disturbed we have had for some years in this household a housekeeper one sarah with whose second name i have never attempted to burden my memory she is a woman of a severe and forbidding aspect prim and demure in her bearing very impassive in her nature and never known within our experience to show signs of any emotion as i sat alone at my breakfast mrs challenger is in the habit of keeping her room of a morning it suddenly entered my head that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether i could find any limits to this womans inperturbability i devised a simple but effective experiment having upset a small vase of flowers which stood in the centre of the cloth i rang the bell and slipped under the table she entered and seeing the room empty imagined that i had withdrawn to the study as i had expected she approached and leaned over the table to replace the vase i had a vision of a cotton stocking and an elastic sided boot protruding my head i sank my teeth into the calf of her leg the experiment was successful beyond belief for some moments she stood paralyzed staring down at my head then with a shriek she tore herself free and rushed from the room i pursued her with some thoughts of an explanation but she flew down the drive and some minutes afterwards i was able to pick her out with my field glasses traveling very rapidly in a south westerly direction i tell you the anecdote for what it is worth i drop it into your brains and await its germination is it illuminative has it conveyed anything to your minds what do you think of it lord john
736737 youll be gettin into serious trouble some of these days if you dont put a brake on
736738 you should drop all work instantly challenger and take three months in a german watering place
736739 now my young friend is it possible that wisdom may come from you where your seniors have so signally failed
736740 there is a mental inhibition by which such symptoms can be checked and controlled
736741 i cannot expect to find it developed in all of you to the same point which it has reached in me for i suppose that the strength of our different mental processes bears some proportion to each other but no doubt it is appreciable even in our young friend here after the little outburst of high spirits which so alarmed my domestic i sat down and reasoned with myself i put it to myself that i had never before felt impelled to bite any of my household the impulse had then been an abnormal one in an instant i perceived the truth my pulse upon examination was ten beats above the usual and my reflexes were increased i called upon my higher and saner self the real g e c seated serene and impregnable behind all mere molecular disturbance i summoned him i say to watch the foolish mental tricks which the poison would play i found that i was indeed the master i could recognize and control a disordered mind it was a remarkable exhibition of the victory of mind over matter for it was a victory over that particular form of matter which is most intimately connected with mind i might almost say that mind was at fault and that personality controlled it thus when my wife came downstairs and i was impelled to slip behind the door and alarm her by some wild cry as she entered i was able to stifle the impulse and to greet her with dignity and restraint an overpowering desire to quack like a duck was met and mastered in the same fashion later when i descended to order the car and found austin bending over it absorbed in repairs i controlled my open hand even after i had lifted it and refrained from giving him an experience which would possibly have caused him to follow in the steps of the housekeeper on the contrary i touched him on the shoulder and ordered the car to be at the door in time to meet your train at the present instant i am most forcibly tempted to take professor summerlee by that silly old beard of his and to shake his head violently backwards and forwards and yet as you see i am perfectly restrained let me commend my example to you
736742 i am willing to admit that my turn of mind is critical rather than constructive and that i am not a ready convert to any new theory especially when it happens to be so unusual and fantastic as this one however as i cast my mind back over the events of the morning and as i reconsider the fatuous conduct of my companions i find it easy to believe that some poison of an exciting kind was responsible for their symptoms
736743 with your permission i will say a few words upon that subject
736744 we are assisting at a tremendous and awful function it is in my opinion the end of the world
736745 which are covered by some infinitesimal but noxious bacillus the gardener passes it through a disinfecting medium it may be that he desires his grapes to be cleaner it may be that he needs space to breed some fresh bacillus less noxious than the last he dips it into the poison and they are gone our gardener is in my opinion about to dip the solar system and the human bacillus the little mortal vibrio which twisted and wriggled upon the outer rind of the earth will in an instant be sterilized out of existence
736746 they are beginning to realize that their continued existence is not really one of the necessities of the universe
736747 the symptoms are for some reason developing more rapidly upon the sea level our seven hundred feet of elevation give us an advantage folk seem to have learned that i am the first authority upon the question no doubt it comes from my letter in the times that was the mayor of a provincial town with whom i talked when we first arrived you may have heard me upon the telephone he seemed to put an entirely inflated value upon his own life i helped him to readjust his ideas
736748 this thing is too serious for mere futile argument do not suppose that i desire to irritate you by any question i may ask but i put it to you whether there may not be some fallacy in your information or in your reasoning there is the sun shining as brightly as ever in the blue sky there are the heather and the flowers and the birds there are the folk enjoying themselves upon the golf links and the laborers yonder cutting the corn you tell us that they and we may be upon the very brink of destruction that this sunlit day may be that day of doom which the human race has so long awaited so far as we know you found this tremendous judgment upon what upon some abnormal lines in a spectrum upon rumours from sumatra upon some curious personal excitement which we have discerned in each other this latter symptom is not so marked but that you and we could by a deliberate effort control it you need not stand on ceremony with us challenger we have all faced death together before now speak out and let us know exactly where we stand and what in your opinion are our prospects for our future
736749 now challenger its up to you to tell us where we are we aint nervous folk as you know well but when it comes to makin a week end visit and finding youve run full butt into the day of judgment it wants a bit of explainin whats the danger and how much of it is there and what are we goin to do to meet it
736750 there was a reuter just come in from singapore to the effect that the sickness seemed to be universal in sumatra and that the lighthouses had not been lit in consequence
736751 an hour later came the following from the same source
736752 there is a similar telegram from paris where the development is not yet as acute india and persia appear to be utterly wiped out the slavonic population of austria is down while the teutonic has hardly been affected speaking generally the dwellers upon the plains and upon the seashore seem so far as my limited information goes to have felt the effects more rapidly than those inland or on the heights even a little elevation makes a considerable difference and perhaps if there be a survivor of the human race he will again be found upon the summit of some ararat even our own little hill may presently prove to be a temporary island amid a sea of disaster but at the present rate of advance a few short hours will submerge us all
736753 is how you could sit there laughin with that stack of telegrams under your hand ive seen death as often as most folk but universal death its awful
736754 you will bear in mind that like yourselves i have not been exempt from the stimulating cerebral effects of the etheric poison but as to the horror with which universal death appears to inspire you i would put it to you that it is somewhat exaggerated if you were sent to sea alone in an open boat to some unknown destination your heart might well sink within you the isolation the uncertainty would oppress you but if your voyage were made in a goodly ship which bore within it all your relations and your friends you would feel that however uncertain your destination might still remain you would at least have one common and simultaneous experience which would hold you to the end in the same close communion a lonely death may be terrible but a universal one as painless as this would appear to be is not in my judgment a matter for apprehension indeed i could sympathize with the person who took the view that the horror lay in the idea of surviving when all that is learned famous and exalted had passed away
736755 we have a cook whose omelettes are only excelled by her cutlets we can but trust that no cosmic disturbance has dulled her excellent abilities my scharzberger of 96 must also be rescued so far as our earnest and united efforts can do it from what would be a deplorable waste of a great vintage
736756 if there is little time left there is the more need that we should spend it in sober and reasonable enjoyment
736757 im expecting the end of the world to day austin
736758 i have explained it also to our friends here youre not afraid are you
736759 no more than laughing gas at the dentists every time you have had it you have practically died
736760 so may death be the worn out bodily machine cant record its
736761 im a christian of sorts but it seems to me there was somethin mighty natural in those ancestors of ours who were buried with their axes and bows and arrows and the like same as if they were livin on just the same as they used to i dont know
736762 that i wouldnt feel more homely myself if i was put away with my old 450 express and the fowlin piece the shorter one with the rubbered stock and a clip or two of cartridges just a fools fancy of course but there it is how does it strike you herr professor
736763 since you ask my opinion it strikes me as an indefensible throwback to the stone age or before it im of the twentieth century myself and would wish to die like a reasonable civilized man i dont know that i am more afraid of death than the rest of you for i am an oldish man and come what may i cant have very much longer to live but it is all against my nature to sit waiting without a struggle like a sheep for the butcher is it quite certain challenger that there is nothing we can do
736764 but what can oxygen effect in the face of a poisoning of the ether there is not a greater difference in quality between a brick bat and a gas than there is between oxygen and ether they are different planes of matter they cannot impinge upon one another come challenger you could not defend such a proposition
736765 my good summerlee this etheric poison is most certainly influenced by material agents we see it in the methods and distribution of the outbreak we should not a priori have expected it but it is undoubtedly a fact hence i am strongly of opinion that a gas like oxygen which increases the vitality and the resisting power of the body would be extremely likely to delay the action of what you have so happily named the daturon it may be that i am mistaken but i have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning
736766 if weve got to sit suckin at those tubes like so many babies with their bottles im not takin any
736767 we have made arrangements it is to my wife that you chiefly owe it that her boudoir shall be made as airtight as is practicable with matting and varnished paper
736768 good heavens challenger you dont suppose you can keep out ether with varnished paper
736769 really my worthy friend you are a trifle perverse in missing the point it is not to keep out the ether that we have gone to such trouble it is to keep in the oxygen i trust that if we can ensure an atmosphere hyper oxygenated to a certain point we may be able to retain our senses i had two tubes of the gas and you have brought me three more it is not much but it is something
736770 i have not an idea we will not turn them on until our symptoms become unbearable then we shall dole the gas out as it is urgently needed it may give us some hours possibly even some days on which we may look out upon a blasted world our own fate is delayed to that extent and we will have the very singular experience we five of being in all probability the absolute rear guard of the human race upon its march into the unknown perhaps you will be kind enough now to give me a hand with the cylinders it seems to me that the atmosphere already grows somewhat more oppressive
736771 how to get rid of our excessive carbon dioxide without unduly wasting our oxygen is a delicate and vital question
736772 with longer time for preparation i could have brought the whole concentrated force of my intelligence to bear more fully upon the problem but as it is we must do what we can the shrubs will be of some small service two of the oxygen tubes are ready to be turned on at an instants notice so that we cannot be taken unawares at the same time it would be well not to go far from the room as the crisis may be a sudden and urgent one
736773 well young fellah when you do youll learn that once fairly out on a round it would take the crack of doom to stop a true golfer halloa theres that telephone bell again
736774 mr malone there are terrible goings on in london for gods sake see if professor challenger can suggest anything that can be done
736775 he regards the crisis as universal and inevitable we have some oxygen here but it can only defer our fate for a few hours
736776 oh george i am so sorry you brought me back
736777 the door of death is indeed as you said hung with beautiful shimmering curtains for once the choking feeling had passed it was all unspeakably soothing and beautiful why have you dragged me back
736778 because i wish that we make the passage together we have been together so many years it would be sad to fall apart at the supreme moment
736779 alone of all mankind i saw and foretold this catastrophe
736780 as to you my good summerlee i trust your last doubts have been resolved as to the meaning of the blurring of the lines in the spectrum and that you will no longer contend that my letter in the times was based upon a delusion
736781 the atmosphere of the room is now strongly hyperoxygenated and i take it that none of us feel any distressing symptoms we can only determine by actual experiments what amount added to the air will serve to neutralize the poison let us see how that will do
736782 they used to keep a white mouse in every submarine as its more delicate organization gave signs of a vicious atmosphere before it was perceived by the sailors you my dear will be our white mouse i have now increased the supply and you are better
736783 possibly we have hit upon the correct mixture when we have ascertained exactly how little will serve we shall be able to compute how long we shall be able to exist unfortunately in resuscitating ourselves we have already consumed a considerable proportion of this first tube
736784 if we have to go what is the use of holdin on you dont suppose theres any chance for us
736785 well then dont you think there is more dignity in takin the jump and not waitin to he pushed in if it must be so im for sayin our prayers turnin off the gas and openin the window
736786 surely george lord john is right and it is better so
736787 when we must die let us by all means die but to deliberately anticipate death seems to me to be a foolish and unjustifiable action
736788 then george if you say so i think so too
736789 if you all want to see it through i am with you its dooced interestin and no mistake about that ive had my share of adventures in my life and as many thrills as most folk but im endin on my top note
736790 none of us can predicate what opportunities of observation one may have from what we may call the spirit plane to the plane of matter it surely must be evident to the most obtuse person
736791 that it is while we are ourselves material that we are most fitted to watch and form a judgment upon material phenomena therefore it is only by keeping alive for these few extra hours that we can hope to carry on with us to some future existence a clear conception of the most stupendous event that the world or the universe so far as we know it has ever encountered to me it would seem a deplorable thing that we should in any way curtail by so much as a minute so wonderful an experience
736792 by george that poor devil of a chauffeur of yours down in the yard has made his last journey no use makin a sally and bringin him in
736793 it couldnt help him and would scatter our gas all over the house even if we ever got back alive my word look at the little birds under the trees
736794 there will i expect be many such possibly whole cities in flames when we consider how many folk may have dropped with lights in their hands the fact of combustion is in itself enough to show that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is normal and that it is the ether which is at fault ah there you see another blaze on the top of crowborough hill it is the golf clubhouse or i am mistaken there is the church clock chiming the hour it would interest our philosophers to know that man made mechanisms has survived the race who made it
736795 my dear the passengers on that train were no more animate than the coals into which they crashed or the carbon which they have now become
736796 it was a train of the living when it left victoria but it was driven and freighted by the dead long before it reached its fate
736797 all over the world the same thing must be going on
736798 think of the ships at sea how they will steam on and on until the furnaces die down or until they run full tilt upon some beach the sailing ships too how they will back and fill with their cargoes of dead sailors while their timbers rot and their joints leak till one by one they sink below the surface perhaps a century hence the atlantic may still be dotted with the old drifting derelicts
736799 if ever geologists should by any chance live upon earth again they will have some strange theories of the existence of man in carboniferous strata
736800 but it seems to me the earth will be to let empty after this when once our human crowd is wiped off it how will it ever get on again
736801 under laws which in their inception are beyond and above us it became peopled why may the same process not happen again
736802 i am not in the habit professor summerlee of saying things which i do not mean the observation is trivial
736803 well you lived an obstinate dogmatist and you mean to die one
736804 and you sir have lived an unimaginative obstructionist and never can hope now to emerge from it
736805 your worst critics will never accuse you of lacking imagination
736806 it would be like you if you used up our last gasp of oxygen in abusing each other what can it matter whether folk come back or not it surely wont be in our time
736807 in that remark sir you betray your own very pronounced limitations
736808 the true scientific mind is not to be tied down by its own conditions of time and space it builds itself an observatory erected upon the border line of present which separates the infinite past from the infinite future from this sure post it makes its sallies even to the beginning and to the end of all things as to death the scientific mind dies at its post working in normal and methodic fashion to the end it disregards so petty a thing as its own physical dissolution as completely as it does all other limitations upon the plane of matter am i right professor summerlee
736809 ive read some leadin articles about you gentlemen controllin her but shes gettin a bit of her own back
736810 a few million years what are they in the great cycle of time the vegetable world has as you can see survived look at the leaves of that plane tree the birds are dead but the plant flourishes from this vegetable life in pond and in marsh will come in time the tiny crawling microscopic slugs which are the pioneers of that great army of life in which for the instant we five have the extraordinary duty of serving as rear guard once the lowest form of life has established itself the final advent of man is as certain as the growth of the oak from the acorn the old circle will swing round once more
736811 the poison may be a mere stratum or layer in the ether a mephitic gulf stream across that mighty ocean in which we float or tolerance may be established and life accommodate itself to a new condition the mere fact that with a comparatively small hyperoxygenation of our blood we can hold out against it is surely a proof in itself that no very great change would be needed to enable animal life to endure it
736812 the world is dead cremation is surely the best burial
736813 it would shorten us up if this house went ablaze
736814 everything is quite safe dear but my head begins to throb again what a dreadful atmosphere
736815 it has lasted us some three and a half hours it is now close on eight ocloek we shall get through the night comfortably i should expect the end about nine oclock to morrow morning we shall see one sunrise which shall be all our own
736816 man does not live upon oxygen alone its dinner time and over i assure you gentlemen that when i invited you to my home and to what i had hoped would be an interesting reunion i had intended that my kitchen should justify itself however we must do what we can i am sure that you will agree with me that it would be folly to consume our air too rapidly by lighting an oil stove i have some small provision of cold meats bread and pickles which with a couple of bottles of claret may serve our turn thank you my dear now as ever you are the queen of managers
736817 we have gone through a great crisis that means molecular disturbance that in turn means the need for repair great sorrow or great joy should bring intense hunger not abstinence from food as our novelists will have it
736818 thats why the country folk have great feasts at funerals
736819 exactly our young friend has hit upon an excellent illustration let me give you another slice of tongue
736820 ive seen them buryin a chief up the aruwimi river and they ate a hippo that must have weighed as much as a tribe there are some of them down new guinea way that eat the late lamented himself just by way of a last tidy up well of all the funeral feasts on this earth i suppose the one we are takin is the queerest
736821 that i find it impossible to feel grief for those who are gone there are my father and mother at bedford i know that they are dead and yet in this tremendous universal tragedy i can feel no sharp sorrow for any individuals even for them
736822 i can see her in my minds eye with her shawl and her lace cap lying back with closed eyes in the old high backed chair near the window her glasses and her book beside her why should i mourn her she has passed and i am passing and i may be nearer her in some other life than england is to ireland yet i grieve to think that that dear body is no more
736823 we do not mourn over the parings of our nails nor the cut locks of our hair though they were once part of ourselves neither does a one legged man yearn sentimentally over his missing member the physical body has rather been a source of pain and fatigue to us it is the constant index of our limitations why then should we worry about its detachment from our psychical selves
736824 a universal death must in its nature be far less terrible than a isolated one
736825 if you saw a single man lying on that floor with his chest knocked in and a hole in his face it would turn you sick but ive seen ten thousand on their backs in the soudan and it gave me no such feelin for when you are makin history the life of any man is too small a thing to worry over when a thousand million pass over together same as happened to day you cant pick your own particlar out of the crowd
736826 youll be the bravest of us all little lady when the time comes ive been a blusterous old husband to you dear but youll just bear in mind that g e c is as he was made and couldnt help himself after all you wouldnt have had anyone else
736827 you can see the curved back of the downs against the glow that fire is miles on the farther side of it the whole town must be alight
736828 summerlee will you step across and satisfy yourself upon the point malone will you kindly verify what i say the little spindle shaped things in the centre are diatoms and may be disregarded since they are probably vegetable rather than animal but the right hand side you will see an undoubted amoeba moving sluggishly across the field the upper screw is the fine adjustment look at it for yourselves
736829 im not troublin my head whether hes alive or dead
736830 we dont so much as know each other by sight so why should i take it to heart i dont suppose hes worryin himself over the state of our health
736831 the flippancy of the half educated is more obstructive to science than the obtuseness of the ignorant
736832 what can it matter whether the amoeba is alive or not
736833 we may as well talk about that as anything else if you think ive been too off hand with the thing or hurt its feelins in any way ill apologize
736834 i cant see why you should attach such importance to the creature being alive it is in the same atmosphere as ourselves so naturally the poison does not act upon it if it were outside of this room it would be dead like all other animal life
736835 well even now i dont feel inclined to hip hurrah about it
736836 it just matters this that the world is a living instead of a dead one if you had the scientific imagination you would cast your mind forward from this one fact and you would see some few millions of years hence a mere passing moment in the enormous flux of the ages the whole world teeming once more with the animal and human life which will spring from this tiny root you have seen a prairie fire where the flames have swept every trace of grass or plant from the surface of the earth and left only a blackened waste you would think that it must be forever desert yet the roots of growth have been left behind and when you pass the place a few years hence you can no longer tell where the black scars used to be here in this tiny creature are the roots of growth of the animal world and by its inherent development and evolution it will surely in time remove every trace of this incomparable crisis in which we are now involved
736837 funny little chap to hang number one among the family portraits got a fine big shirt stud on him
736838 that the object for which this world was created was that it should produce and sustain human life
736839 sometimes i think that it is only the monstrous conceit of mankind which makes him think that all this stage was erected for him to strut upon
736840 we cannot be dogmatic about it but at least without what you have ventured to call monstrous conceit we can surely say that we are the highest thing in nature
736841 think of all the millions and possibly billions of years that the earth swung empty through space or if not empty at least without a sign or thought of the human race think of it washed by the rain and scorched by the sun and swept by the wind for those unnumbered ages man only came into being yesterday so far as geological times goes why then should it be taken for granted that all this stupendous preparation was for his benefit
736842 how can we tell for some reason altogether beyond our conception and man may have been a mere accident a by product evolved in the process it is as if the scum upon the surface of the ocean imagined that the ocean was created in order to produce and sustain it or a mouse in a cathedral thought that the building was its own proper ordained residence
736843 we could do with a joke in these hard times what was it then
736844 the questions that we spent so much labor and thought over think of anglo german competition for example or the persian gulf that my old chief was so keen about whoever would have guessed when we fumed and fretted so how they were to be eventually solved
736845 our special correspondent found the eminent scientist seated upon the roof whither he had retreated to avoid the crowd of terrified patients who had stormed his dwelling with a manner which plainly showed his appreciation of the immense gravity of the occasion the celebrated physician refused to admit that every avenue of hope had been closed
736846 say young fellah dont tell me youve been writin up your impressions in that paper on your knee
736847 well i dont believe anyone but an irishman would have done that i expect youll have to wait till little brother amoeba gets grown up before youll find a reader he dont seem to take much stock of things just at present well herr professor what are the prospects
736848 theres that song of yours george ring out the old ring in the new it was prophetic but you are shivering my poor dear friends i have been warm under a coverlet all night and you cold in your chairs but ill soon set you right
736849 but the nearer i get to it the easier it seems dont you think we ought to pray george
736850 we all have our own ways of praying mine is a complete acquiescence in whatever fate may send me a cheerful acquiescence the highest religion and the highest science seem to unite on that
736851 i cannot truthfully describe my mental attitude as acquiescence and far less cheerful acquiescence
736852 i submit because i have to i confess that i should have liked another year of life to finish my classification of the chalk fossils
736853 when weighed against the fact that my own magnum opus the ladder of life is still in the first stages my brain my reading my experience in fact my whole unique equipment were to be condensed into that epoch making volume and yet as i say i acquiesce
736854 i expect weve all left some loose ends stickin out
736855 well it just so happens that i was tidied up and ready id promised merivale to go to tibet for a snow leopard in the spring but its hard on you mrs challenger when you have just built up this pretty home
736856 where george is there is my home but oh what would i not give for one last walk together in the fresh morning air upon those beautiful downs
736857 depending upon the pressure and care with which it has been bottled i am inclined to agree with you roxton that this one is defective
736858 so we are to be cheated out of the last hour of our lives
736859 an excellent final illustration of the sordid age in which we have lived well challenger now is your time if you wish to study the subjective phenomena of physical dissolution
736860 sit on the stool at my knee and give me your hand
736861 i think my friends that a further delay in this insufferable atmosphere is hardly advisable you would not desire it dear would you
736862 ive seen the folk bathin in the serpentine in winter
736863 when the rest are in you see one or two shiverin on the bank envyin the others that have taken the plunge its the last that have the worst of it im all for a header and have done with it
736864 weve had our quarrels in our time but thats all over
736865 we were good friends and had a respect for each other under the surface good by
736866 into the hands of the power that made us we render ourselves again
736867 the world has cleared the poison belt but we alone of all mankind are saved
736868 if we had only passed with the others oh why did you save us i feel as if it is we that are dead and everyone else alive
736869 i have always found that the highest wisdom lies in an acquiescence with the actual
736870 i dont see that it matters a row of pins whether you acquiesce or whether you dont
736871 youve got to take it whether you take it fightin or take it lyin down so whats the odds whether you acquiesce or not i cant remember that anyone asked our permission before the thing began and nobodys likely to ask it now so what difference can it make what we may think of it
736872 it is just all the difference between happiness and misery
736873 you can swim with the tide and have peace in mind and soul or you can thrust against it and be bruised and weary this business is beyond us so let us accept it as it stands and say no more
736874 but what in the world are we to do with our lives
736875 what am i to do for example there are no newspapers so theres an end of my vocation
736876 and theres nothin left to shoot and no more soldierin so theres an end of mine
736877 and there are no students so theres an end of mine
736878 but i have my husband and my house so i can thank heaven that there is no end of mine
736879 for science is not dead and this catastrophe in itself will offer us many most absorbing problems for investigation
736880 it was about three or a little after yesterday afternoon that the world finally entered the poison belt to the extent of being completely submerged it is now nine oclock the question is at what hour did we pass out from it
736881 as late as eight oclock i distinctly felt the same choking at my throat which came at the outset
736882 then we shall say that it passed just after eight oclock for seventeen hours the world has been soaked in the poisonous ether for that length of time the great gardener has sterilized the human mold which had grown over the surface of his fruit is it possible that the work is incompletely done that others may have survived besides ourselves
736883 why should we be the only pebbles on the beach
736884 it is absurd to suppose that anyone besides ourselves can possibly have survived
736885 consider that the poison was so virulent that even a man who is as strong as an ox and has not a nerve in his body like malone here could hardly get up the stairs before he fell unconscious is it likely that anyone could stand seventeen minutes of it far less hours
736886 unless someone saw it coming and made preparation same as old friend challenger did
736887 the combination of observation inference and anticipatory imagination which enabled me to foresee the danger is what one can hardly expect twice in the same generation
736888 there can be little doubt of that we have to remember however that the poison worked from below upwards and would possibly be less virulent in the higher strata of the atmosphere it is strange indeed that it should be so but it presents one of those features which will afford us in the future a fascinating field for study one could imagine therefore that if one had to search for survivors one would turn ones eyes with best hopes of success to some tibetan village or some alpine farm many thousands of feet above the sea level
736889 well considerin that there are no railroads and no steamers you might as well talk about survivors in the moon
736890 but what im askin myself is whether its really over or whether its only half time
736891 but so it did yesterday i am by no means assured that it is all over
736892 but if you get an earthquake shock you are mighty likely to have a second one right on the top of it i think wed be wise to stretch our legs and have a breath of air while we have the chance since our oxygen is exhausted we may just as well be caught outside as in
736893 i dont know how you fellows feel about it but for my part i simply cant sit here and do nothin
736894 you would have the kindness to suggest what you think we ought to do
736895 get a move on us and see all that has happened
736896 but not in this little country village we can see from the window all that this place can teach us
736897 you may be equal to a forty mile walk but im not so sure about challenger with his stumpy legs and i am perfectly sure about myself
736898 if you could see your way sir to confining your remarks to your own physical peculiarities you would find that you had an ample field for comment
736899 i had no intention to offend you my dear challenger
736900 you cant be held responsible for your own physique if nature has given you a short heavy body you cannot possibly help having stumpy legs
736901 whats the matter with the motor car why should we not go in that
736902 at the same time you are right in supposing that the human intellect in its higher manifestations should be sufficiently flexible to turn itself to anything your idea is an excellent one lord john i myself will drive you all to london
736903 you only tried once and you remember how you crashed through the gate of the garage
736904 you can consider the matter settled i will certainly drive you all to london
736905 i never thought id live to take the whole human race in one load theres just room for five as i remember it get your things on and ill be ready at the door by ten oclock
736906 it is a lucky chance that we happened to pass
736907 gentlemen i beg that you will be frank with me what effect will these events have upon london and north western railway shares
736908 if that is gone i may as well go too
736909 but it seems to me the country is more cheerful than the town dead london is gettin on my nerves im for a cast round and then gettin back to rotherfield
736910 i confess that i do not see what we can hope for here
736911 it is difficult for us to conceive that out of seven millions of people there is only this one old woman who by some peculiarity of constitution or some accident of occupation has managed to survive this catastrophe
736912 if there should be others how can we hope to find them george
736913 and yet i agree with you that we cannot go back until we have tried
736914 i really see no purpose to be served by our staying any longer in london i suggest that we return at once to rotherfield and then take counsel as to how we shall most profitably employ the years which lie before us
736915 youve hit on a dooced good notion give me a grip and well soon have a move on it
736916 for gods sake george let us get back to rotherfield another hour of this dreadful silent city would drive me mad
736917 dash it all challenger you dont mean to believe that those folk were asleep with their staring eyes and stiff limbs and that awful death grin on their faces
736918 it can only have been the condition that is called catalepsy
736919 it has been a rare phenomenon in the past and
736920 but after all that is only a name and we know as little of the result as we do of the poison which has caused it the most we can say is that the vitiated ether has produced a temporary death
736921 lubricators left running sir someone has been fooling with the car i expect its that young garden boy sir
736922 i expect i came over queer when i was hosing her down i seem to remember flopping over by the step but ill swear i never left those lubricator taps on
736923 after all it is natural that the whole world should hasten to know what i think of such an episode
736924 for he was on the road in his cab before ever the crisis came
736925 oh george you should be kinder and more considerate to others surely you have learned something from what we have undergone
736926 a poisonous breed eh malone the worst weed in modern civilization the ready tool of the quack and the hindrance of the self respecting man when did they ever say a good word for me
736927 when did you ever say a good word to them
736928 come sir this is a stranger who has made a journey to see you i am sure that you wont be rude to him
736929 you come with me and do the talking i protest in advance against any such outrageous invasion of my private life
736930 because our people in america would very much like to hear more about this danger which is in your opinion pressing upon the world
736931 i know of no danger which is now pressing upon the world
736932 i meant sir the chances that the world might run into a belt of poisonous ether
736933 i cannot understand then how you can say that there is no such danger i am alluding to your own letter published above your name in the london times of this morning
736934 you must admit that the london times is a daily paper
736935 well to tell the truth your people seemed more lively and generally human than i have ever seen them the baggage man set out to tell me a funny story and thats a new experience for me in this country
736936 i came here to interview you professor but it seems to be a case of is this nigger fishing or is this fish niggering youre doing most of the work
736937 it happens to interest me do you recall the hour
736938 how far do you suppose it is to the station
736939 well i should reckon the best part of two miles
736940 well half an hour maybe with that asthmatic in front
736941 its run down that horse has broken every record sure the sun is pretty low now that i come to look at it well theres something here i dont understand
736942 have you no remembrance of anything remarkable as you came up the hill
736943 well i seem to recollect that i was mighty sleepy once it comes back to me that i wanted to say something to the driver and that i couldnt make him heed me i guess it was the heat but i felt swimmy for a moment thats all
736944 they have all felt swimmy for a moment none of them have as yet any comprehension of what has occurred each will go on with his interrupted job as austin has snatched up his hose pipe or the golfer continued his game your editor malone will continue the issue of his papers and very much amazed he will be at finding that an issue is missing yes my young friend
736945 it may interest you to know that the world has swum through the poisonous current which swirls like the gulf stream through the ocean of ether you will also kindly note for your own future convenience that to day is not friday august the twenty seventh but saturday august the twenty eighth and that you sat senseless in your cab for twenty eight hours upon the rotherfield hill
736946 that our human race are a feeble folk before the infinite latent forces which surround us from the prophets of old and from the philosophers of our own time the same message and warning have reached us but like all oft repeated truths it has in time lost something of its actuality and cogency a lesson an actual experience was needed to bring it home it is from that salutory but terrible ordeal that we have just emerged with minds which are still stunned by the suddenness of the blow and with spirits which are chastened by the realization of our own limitations and impotence the world has paid a fearful price for its schooling hardly yet have we learned the full tale of disaster but the destruction by fire of new york of orleans and of brighton constitutes in itself one of the greatest tragedies in the history of our race when the account of the railway and shipping accidents has been completed it will furnish grim reading although there is evidence to show that in the vast majority of cases the drivers of trains and engineers of steamers succeeded in shutting off their motive power before succumbing to the poison but the material damage enormous as it is both in life and in property is not the consideration which will be uppermost in our minds to day all this may in time be forgotten but what will not be forgotten and what will and should continue to obsess our imaginations is this revelation of the possibilities of the universe this destruction of our ignorant self complacency and this demonstration of how narrow is the path of our material existence and what abysses may lie upon either side of it solemnity and humility are at the base of all our emotions to day may they be the foundations upon which a more earnest and reverent race may build a more worthy temple
736947 it all seems very unchanged billy you dont change ei ther i hope the same can be said of him
736948 yes sir he is very hard at it just now im frightened for his health he gets paler and thinner and he eats nothing when will you be pleased to dine mr holmes mrs hudson asked seven thirty the day after to morrow said he you know his way when he is keen on a case
736949 hes following someone yesterday he was out as a work man looking for a job to day he was an old woman fairly took me in he did and i ought to know his ways by now
736950 i dont mind telling you sir but it should go no farther its this case of the crown diamond
736951 yes sir they must get it back sir why we had the prime
736952 yes sir you know what that means hes a stiffun sir if i may say so i can get along with the prime minister and ive nothing against the home secretary who seemed a civil oblig ing sort of man but i cant stand his lordship neither can mr holmes sir you see he dont believe in mr holmes and he was against employing him hed rather he failed
736953 well well hope he wont fail and that lord cantlemere will be confounded but i say billy what is that curtain for across the window
736954 mr holmes had it put up there three days ago weve got something funny behind it
736955 we put it at different angles so that it may seem more lifelike i wouldnt dare touch it if the blind were not down but when its up you can see this from across the way
736956 there are folk who watch us from over yonder i can see a fellow now at the window have a look for yourself
736957 you were in danger of your life then my boy and i cant do without you just yet well watson it is good to see you in your old quarters once again you come at a critical moment
736958 you can go billy that boy is a problem watson how far am i justified in allowing him to be in danger
736959 even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that but we may be comfortable in the meantime may we not is alcohol permitted the gasogene and cigars are in the old place let me see you once more in the customary armchair you have not i hope learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco it has to take the place of food these days
736960 because the faculties become refined when you starve them why surely as a doctor my dear watson you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain i am a brain watson the rest of me is a mere appendix therefore it is the brain i must consider
736961 ah yes in case it should come off it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer you can give it to scotland yard with my love and a parting blessing sylvius is the name count negretto sylvius write it down man write it down 136 moorside gardens n w got it
736962 count me in holmes i have nothing to do for a day or two
736963 your morals dont improve watson you have added fib bing to your other vices you bear every sign of the busy medical man with calls on him every hour
736964 not such important ones but cant you have this fellow arrested
736965 yes the great yellow mazarin stone ive cast my net and i have my fish but i have not got the stone what is the use of taking them we can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels but that is not what i am out for its the stone i want
736966 yes and hes a shark he bites the other is sam merton the boxer not a bad fellow sam but the count has used him sams not a shark he is a great big silly bull headed gudgeon but he is flopping about in my net all the same
736967 ive been at his very elbow all the morning youve seen me as an old lady watson i was never more convincing he actually picked up my parasol for me once by your leave madame said he half ltalian you know and with the south ern graces of manner when in the mood but a devil incarnate in the other mood life is full of whimsical happenings watson
736968 well perhaps it might i followed him to old straubenzees workshop in the minories straubenzee made the air gun a very pretty bit of work as i understand and i rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment have you seen the dummy of course billy showed it to you well it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment ah billy what is it
736969 the man himself i had hardly expected this grasp the nettle watson a man of nerve possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game it would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag this is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel
736970 i probably shall but not just yet would you glance care fully out of the window watson and see if anyone is hanging about in the street
736971 that will be sam merton the faithful but rather fatuous sam where is this gentleman billy
736972 if i am not in the room show him in all the same
736973 look here holmes this is simply impossible this is a desperate man who sticks at nothing he may have come to murder you
736974 yes you can watson and you will for you have never failed to play the game i am sure you will play it to the end this man has come for his own purpose but he may stay for mine
736975 take a cab to scotland yard and give this to youghal of the c i d come back with the police the fellows arrest will follow
736976 before you return i may have just time enough to find out where the stone is
736977 i think we will go out through the bedroom this second exit is exceedingly useful i rather want to see my shark without his seeing me and i have as you will remember my own way of doing it
736978 tavernier the french modeller made it he is as good at waxworks as your friend straubenzee is at air guns
736979 put your hat and stick on the side table thank you pray
736980 i too wished to have some words with you holmes that is why i am here i wont deny that i intended to assault you just now
736981 i rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head
736982 because you have gone out of your way to annoy me because you have put your creatures upon my track
736983 nonsense i have had them followed two can play at that game holmes
736984 it is a small point count sylvius but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me you can understand that with my routine of work i should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues gallery and you will agree that exceptions are invidious
736985 excellent but i assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents
736986 other people can observe as well as you yesterday there was an old sporting man to day it was an elderly woman they held me in view all day
736987 really sir you compliment me old baron dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost and now you give my little impersona tions your kindly praise
736988 you can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the minories before you began to suspect
736989 have seen this humble home again i was well aware of it we all have neglected opportunities to deplore as it happens you did not know so here we are
736990 what you say only makes the matter worse it was not your agents but your play acting busybody self you admit that you have dogged me why
736991 come now count you used to shoot lions in algeria
736992 and no doubt to free the country from a pest
736993 sit down sir sit down there was another more practical reason i want that yellow diamond
736994 you knew that i was after you for that the real reason why you are here to night is to find out how much i know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential well i should say that from your point of view it is absolutely essen tial for i know all about it save only one thing which you are about to tell me
736995 oh you want to know that do you how the devil should i be able to lell you where it is
736996 you are absolute plate glass i see to the very back of your mind
736997 now count if you will be reasonable we can do business if not you will get hurt
736998 yes sir you you are all here every action of yor vile and dangerous life
736999 its all here count the real facts as to the death of old mrs harold who left you the blymer estate which you so rapidly gambled away
737000 plenty more here count here is the robbery in the train de luxe to the riviera on february 13 1892 here is the forged check in the same year on the credit lyonnais
737001 then i am right on the others now count you are a card player when the other fellow has all the trumps it saves time to throw down your hand
737002 what has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke
737003 gently count restrain that eager mind let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion i have all this against you but above all i have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the crown diamond
737004 i have the cabman who took you to whitehall and the cabman who brought you away i have the commissionaire who saw you near the case i have ikey sanders who refused to cut it up for you ikey has peached and the game is up
737005 i put it all upon the table but one card is missing its the king of dia monds i dont know where the stone is
737006 no now be reasonable count consider the situation you are going to be locked up for twenty years so is sam merton what good are you going to get out of your diamond none in the world but if you hand it over well ill compound a felony we dont want you or sam we want the stone give that up and so far as i am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future if you make another slip well it will be the last but this time my commission is to get the stone not you
737007 why then alas it must be you and not the stone
737008 i think count that it would be as well to have your friend sam at this conference after all his interests should be repre sented billy you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door ask him to come up
737009 no violence billy dont be rough with him if you tell him that count sylvius wants him he will certainly come
737010 my friend watson was with me just now i told him that i had a shark and a gudgeon in my net now i am drawing the net and up they come together
737011 i have often had the same idea does it matter very much aher all count your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal but these anticipations of the future are morbid why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present
737012 it is no use your fingering your revolver my friend
737013 you know perfectly well that you dare not use it even if i gave you time to draw it nasty noisy things revolvers count better stick to air guns ah i think i hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner good day mr merton rather dull in the street is it not
737014 whats the game now count whats this fellow want whats up
737015 if i may put it in a nutshell mr merton i should say it was all up
737016 is this cove trying to be funny or what im not in the funny mood myself
737017 i think i can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances now look here count sylvius im a busy man and i cant waste time im going into that bedroom pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence you can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence i shall try over the hoffman barcarole upon my violin in five min utes i shall return for your final answer you quite grasp the alternative do you not shall we take you or shall we have the stone
737018 he knows a damned sight too much about it im not sure that he doesnt know all about it
737019 he has has he ill do him down a thick un for that if i swing for it
737020 that wont help us much weve got to make up our minds what to do
737021 hes a leary cove that wants watching i sup pose hes not listening
737022 thats right maybe somebodys behind a curtain too many curtains in this room
737023 a fake is it well strike me madame tussaud aint in it its the living spit of him gown and all but them curtains count
737024 oh confound the curtains we are wasting our time and there is none too much he can lag us over this stone
737025 but hell let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is
737026 what give it up give up a hundred thousand quid
737027 hes alone in there lets do him in if his light were out we should have nothing to fear
737028 he is armed and ready if we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this besides its likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got hallo what was that
737029 now look here guvnor youve got the brains surely you can think a way out of it if slugging is no use then its up to you
737030 the stone is here in my secret pocket i take no chances leaving it about it can be out of england to night and cut into four pieces in amsterdam before sunday he knows nothing of van seddar
737031 he was but now he must get off by the next boat one or other of us must slip round with the stone to lime street and tell him
737032 well he must take it as it is and chance it theres not a moment to lose
737033 we can fool him easily enough you see the damned fool wont arrest us if he can get the stone well well promise him the stone well put him on the wrong track about it and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in holland and we out of the country
737034 you go on and tell the dutchman to get a move on him ill see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession ill tell him that the stone is in liverpool confound that whining music it gets on my nerves by the time he finds it isnt in liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water come back here out of a line with that keyhole here is the stone
737035 where could i have it safer if we could take it out of whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings
737036 what dye think im going to snatch it off you see here mister im getting a bit tired of your ways
737037 well well no offence sam we cant afford to quarrel come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly now hold it to the light here
737038 no violence gentlemen no violence i beg of you con sider the furniture it must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one the police are waiting below
737039 your surprise is very natural you are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain i fancied that you must have heard me when i displaced the figure but luck was on my side it gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence
737040 we give you best holmes i believe you are the devil himself
737041 but i say what about that bloomin fiddle i hear it yet
737042 you are perfectly right let it play these modern gramophones are a remarkable invention
737043 show him up biily this is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests
737044 he is an excellent and loyal person but rather of the old regime shall we make him unbend dare we venture upon a slight liberty he knows we may conjecture nothing of what has occurred
737045 how do you do lord cantlemere it is chilly for the time of year but rather warm indoors may i take your overcoat
737046 no i thank you i will not take it off
737047 pray allow me my friend dr watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious
737048 i am quite comfortable sir i have no need to stay i have simply looked in to know how your self appointed task was progressing
737049 every man finds his limitations mr holmes but at least it cures us of the weakness of self satisfaction
737050 especially upon one point possibly you could help me upon
737051 you apply for my advice rather late in the day i thought that you had your own all sufficient methods still i am ready to help you
737052 you see lord cantlemere we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves
737053 exactly but the question is how shall we proceed against the receiver
737054 it is as well to have our plans ready now what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver
737055 in that case my dear sir i shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest
737056 you take a great liberty mr holmes in fifty years of official life i cannot recall such a case i am a busy man sir engaged upon important affairs and i have no time or taste for foolish jokes i may tell you frankly sir that i have never been a believer in your powers and that i have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force your conduct confirms all my conclusions i have the honour sir to wish you good evening
737057 to actually go off with the mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it
737058 put your hand in the right hand pocket of your overcoat
737059 my old friend here will tell you that i have an impish habit of practical joking also that i can never resist a dramatic situation i took the liberty the very great liberty i admit of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview
737060 sir i am bewildered but yes it is indeed the mazarin
737061 the case is but half finished the details can wait no doubt lord cantlemere your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke billy you will show his lord ship out and tell mrs hudson that i should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible
737062 it has enabled you to probe my secret yes i have a case after a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more
737063 there is little to share but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the family herald which i observed yesterday upon the hall table even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incom patible with the love romance in that excellent periodical
737064 well he was once senator for some western state but is better known as the greatest gold mining magnate in the world
737065 yes i know of him he has surely lived in england for some time his name is very familiar
737066 yes he bought a considerable estate in hampshire some five years ago possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife
737067 of course i remember it now that is why the name is familiar but i really know nothing of the details
737068 i had no idea that the case was coming my way or i should have had my extracts ready
737069 the fact is that the problem though exceedingly sensational appeared to present no diffi culty the interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence that was the view taken by the coroners jury and also in the police court proceedings it is now referred to the assizes at winchester i fear it is a thankless business i can discover facts watson but i cannot change them unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light i do not see what my client can hope for
737070 ah i forgot i had not told you i am getting into your involved habit watson of telling a story backward you had best read this first
737071 that is the gentleman i await as to the story you have hardly time to master all these papers so i must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings this man is the greatest financial power in the world and a man as i understand of most violent and formidable character he mar ried a wife the victim of this tragedy of whom i know nothing save that she was past her prime which was the more unfortu nate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children these are the three people concerned and the scene is a grand old manor house the centre of a historical english state then as to the tragedy the wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house late at night clad in her dinner dress with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain no weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder no weapon near her watson mark that the crime seems to have been committed late in the evening and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven oclock when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house is this too con densed or can you follow it clearly
737072 it is all very clear but why suspect the governess
737073 well in the first place there is some very direct evidence a revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which cor responded with the bullet was found on the floor of her ward robe
737074 yes watson it was found pretty damning eh so the two juries thought then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess hows that finally there is the motive senator gibson is an attractive person if his wife dies who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer love fortune power all depending upon one middle aged life ugly watson very ugly
737075 nor could she prove an alibi on the contrary she had to admit that she was down near thor bridge that was the scene of the tragedy about that hour she couldnt deny it for some passing villager had seen her there
737076 and yet watson and yet this bridge a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides carries the drive over the nar rowest part of a long deep reed girt sheet of water thor mere it is called in the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman such are the main facts but here if i mistake not is our client considerably before his time
737077 pray sit down i fear i can only give you a short time for i have an appointment at eleven
737078 mr gibson is coming mr gibson is my employer i am manager of his estate mr holmes he is a villain an infernal villain
737079 i have to be emphatic mr holmes for the time is so limited i would not have him find me here for the world he is almost due now but i was so situated that i could not come earlier his secretary mr ferguson only told me this morning of his appointment with you
737080 i have given him notice in a couple of weeks i shall have shaken off his accursed slavery a hard man mr holmes hard to all about him those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities but his wife was his chief victim he was brutal to her yes sir brutal how she came by her death i do not know but i am sure that he had made her life a misery to her she was a creature of the tropics a brazilian by birth as no doubt you know
737081 tropical by birth and tropical by nature a child of the sun and of passion she had loved him as such women can love but when her own physical charms had faded i am told that they once were great there was nothing to hold him we all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her but he is plausible and cunning that is all i have to say to you dont take him at his face value there is more behind now ill go no no dont detain me he is almost due
737082 mr gibson seems to have a nice loyal household but the warning is a useful one and now we can only wait till the man himself appears
737083 that money is nothing to me in this case you can burn it if its any use in lighting you to the truth this woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared and its up to you to do it name your figure
737084 i do not vary them save when i remit them altogether
737085 well if dollars make no difference to you think of the reputation if you pull this off every paper in england and america will be booming you youll be the talk of two continents
737086 thank you mr gibson i do not think that i am in need of booming it may surprise you to know that i prefer to work anonymously and that it is the problem itself which attracts me but we are wasting time let us get down to the facts
737087 i think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports i dont know that i can add anything which will help you but if there is anything you would wish more light upon well i am here to give it
737088 what were the exact relations between you and miss dunbar
737089 i suppose you are within your rights and maybe doing your duty in asking such a question mr holmes
737090 then i can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with or ever saw save when she was in the company of his children
737091 and i have no time or taste for aimless conversations i wish you good morning
737092 what the devil do you mean by this mr holmes do you dismiss my case
737093 well mr gibson at least i dismiss you i should have thought my words were plain
737094 plain enough but whats at the back of it raising the price on me or afraid to tackle it or what ive a right to a plain answer
737095 ill give you one this case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information
737096 well i was trying to express it as delicately as i could but if you insist upon the word i will not contradict you
737097 dont be noisy mr gibson i find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling i suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage
737098 well its your choice i guess you know how to run your own business i cant make you touch the case against your will youve done yourself no good this morning mr holmes for i have broken stronger men than you no man ever crossed me and was the better for it
737099 so many have said so and yet here i am
737100 well good morning mr gibson you have a good deal yet to learn
737101 well holmes i must confess that when i consider that this
737102 but what were his relations with the governess and how did you discover them
737103 bluff watson bluff when i considered the passionate unconventional unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his self contained manner and appearance it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim weve got to under stand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth you saw the frontal attack which i made upon him and how imperturbably he received it then i bluffed him by giving him the impression that i was absolutely certain when in reality i was only extremely suspicious
737104 he is sure to come back he must come back he cant leave it where it is ha isnt that a ring yes there is his footstep well mr gibson i was just saying to dr watson that you were somewhat overdue
737105 ive been thinking it over mr holmes and i feel that i have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss you are justified in getting down to the facts whatever they may be and i think the more of you for it i can assure you however that the relations between miss dunbar and me dont really touch this case
737106 yes i guess that is so youre like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis
737107 exactly that expresses it and it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case
737108 that may be so but you will admit mr holmes that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point blank what their relations with a woman may be if there is really some serious feeling in the case i guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they dont welcome intruders and you burst suddenly into it but the object excuses you since it was to try and save her well the stakes are down and the reserve open and you can explore where you will what is it you want
737109 i can give it to you in a very few words mr holmes
737110 there are some things that are painful as well as
737111 then came miss grace dunbar she answered our advertise ment and became governess to our two children perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers the whole world has pro claimed that she also is a very beautiful woman now i make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours and i will admit to you that i could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her do you blame me mr holmes
737112 i do not blame you for feeling it i should blame you if you expressed it since this young lady was in a sense under your protection
737113 im not pretending to be any better than i am i guess all my life ive been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted and i never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman i told her so
737114 i said to her that if i could marry her i would but that it was out of my power i said that money was no object and that all i could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done
737115 see here mr holmes i came to you on a question of evidence not on a question of morals im not asking for your criticism
737116 it is only for the young ladys sake that i touch your case at all
737117 i dont know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences
737118 thats how i feel myself about it now i thank god that my plans did not work out as i intended she would have none of it and she wanted to leave the house instantly
737119 well in the first place others were dependent upon her and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living when i had sworn as i did that she should never be molested again she consented to remain but there was another reason she knew the influence she had over me and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world she wanted to use it for good
737120 well she knew something of my affairs they are large mr holmes large beyond the belief of an ordinary man i can make or break and it is usually break it wasnt individuals only it was communities cities even nations business is a hard game and the weak go to the wall i played the game for all it was worth i never squealed myself and i never cared if the other fellow squealed but she saw it different i guess she was right she believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life that was how she saw it and i guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting she found that i listened to what she said and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions so she stayed and then this came along
737121 its very black against her i cant deny that and women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man at first i was so rattled and taken aback that i was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature one explanation came into my head i give it to you mr holmes for what it is worth there is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous there is a soul jealousy that can be as frantic as any body jealousy and though my wife had no cause and i think she understood this for the latter she was aware that this english girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had it was an influence for good but that did not mend the matter she was crazy with hatred and the heat of the amazon was always in her blood she might have planned to murder miss dunbar or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it
737122 indeed it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder
737123 well that is not final is it one can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver she might even throw it down among her clothes hardly knowing what she was doing and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial since all explanation was impossible what is against such a supposition
737124 i have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach winchester by the evening train when i have seen this young lady it is very possible that i may be of more use to you in the matter though i cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire
737125 anyhow id rather have you than scotland yard mr holmes
737126 if the yard gets called into a case then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure now you play straight so ive heard
737127 if i can clear it up i dont ask to have my name mentioned
737128 well its very handsome of you i am sure and your friend dr watson can be trusted i know now mr holmes as we walk down to the place there is one question i should like to ask you id breathe it to no soul but you
737129 dont you think there might be a case against mr neil gibson himself
737130 youve not seen miss dunbar she is a wonderful fine woman in every way he may well have wished his wife out of the road and these americans are readier with pistols than our folk are it was his pistol you know
737131 yes sir it was one of a pair that he had
737132 well the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another we never quite matched that particular pistol but the box was made for two
737133 if it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it
737134 well we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over
737135 later perhaps i think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy
737136 that was where mrs gibsons body lay i marked it by that stone
737137 i understand that you were there before it was moved
737138 mr gibson himself the moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive
737139 that was sensible i gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters
737140 on the back sir no trace of a struggle no marks no weapon the short note from miss dunbar was clutched in her left hand
737141 that is of great importance it excludes the idea that anyone
737142 her defence was reserved for the assizes she would say nothing
737143 the problem is certainly a very interesting one the point of the letter is very obscure is it not
737144 it seemed if i may be so bold as to say so the only really clear point in the whole case
737145 granting that the letter is genuine and was really written it was certainly received some time before say one hour or two why then was this lady still clasping it in her left hand why should she carry it so carefully she did not need to refer to it in the interview does it not seem remarkable
737146 i think i should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out
737147 yes sir we saw the chip on the ledge i expect its been done by some passer by
737148 yes it was a hard knock in a curious place too it was not from above but from below for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet
737149 but it is at least fifteen feet from the body
737150 yes it is fifteen feet from the body it may have nothing to do with the matter but it is a point worth noting i do not think that we have anything more to learn here there were no foot steps you say
737151 the ground was iron hard sir there were no traces at all
737152 then we can go we will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak then we shall get on to winchester for i should desire to see miss dunbar before we go farther
737153 mr gibson has his enemies as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods
737154 he sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed he is a man of violence sir and there are times when all of us are afraid of him i am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified
737155 no i cannot say that but i have heard words which were nearly as bad words of cold cutting contempt even before the servants
737156 our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life
737157 well watson we have come on a good many facts some of them new ones and yet i seem some way from my conclusion in spite of the very evident dislike which mr bates has to his employer i gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library dinner was over at 8 30 and all was normal up to then it is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note there is no evidence at all that mr gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five oclock on the other hand miss dunbar as i understand it admits that she had made an appointment to meet mrs gibson at the bridge beyond this she would say nothing as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence we have several very vital questions to ask that young lady and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her i must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing
737158 that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all
737159 not so watson it had struck me even at my first perfunc tory reading as very strange and now that i am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope we must look for consistency where there is a want of it we must suspect deception
737160 well now watson suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who in a cold premeditated fashion is about to get rid of a rival you have planned it a note has been written the victim has come you have your weapon the crime is done it has been workmanlike and com plete do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed beds which would forever cover it but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe the very first place that would be searched your best friends would hardly call you a schemer watson and yet i could not picture you doing anything so crude as that
737161 no no watson i will not admit that it is possible where a crime is coolly premeditated then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also i hope therefore that we are in the presence of a serious misconception
737162 well we shall set about explaining it when once your point of view is changed the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth for example there is this revolver miss dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it on our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so therefore it was placed in her wardrobe who placed it there someone who wished to incriminate her was not that person the actual criminal you see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry
737163 perhaps mr neil gibson has told you something of what occurred between us
737164 you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story after seeing you i am prepared to accept mr gibsons statement both as to the influ ence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him but why was the whole situation not brought out in court
737165 it seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained i thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family but i understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious
737166 i beg you to have no illusions upon the point mr cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear it would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger give me all the help you can then to get at the truth
737167 tell us then of your true relations with mr gibsons wife
737168 she hated me mr holmes she hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature she was a woman who would do nothing by halves and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me it is probable that she misunderstood our relations i would not wish to wrong her but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental and even spiritual tie which held her husband to me or imagine that it was only my desire to influ ence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof i can see now that i was wrong nothing could justify me in remaining where i was a cause of unhappiness and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if i had left the house
737169 i beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening
737170 i can tell you the truth so far as i know it mr holmes but i am in a position to prove nothing and there are points the most vital points which i can neither explain nor can i imagine any explanation
737171 if you will find the facts perhaps others may find the explanation
737172 with regard then to my presence at thor bridge that night i received a note from mrs gibson in the morning it lay on the table of the schoolroom and it may have been left there by her own hand it implored me to see her there after dinner said she had something important to say to me and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden as she desired no one to be in our confidence i saw no reason for such secrecy but i did as she asked accepting the appointment she asked me to destroy her note and i burned it in the schoolroom grate she was very much afraid of her husband who treated her with a harshness for which i frequently reproached him and i could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview
737173 yes i was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died
737174 i went down as i had promised when i reached the bridge she was waiting for me never did i realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me she was like a mad woman indeed i think she was a mad woman subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have how else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart i will not say what she said she poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words i did not even answer i could not it was dreadful to see her i put my hands to my ears and rushed away when i left her she was standing still shrieking out her curses at me in the mouth of the bridge
737175 and yet presuming that she met her death shortly after you
737176 no i heard nothing but indeed mr holmes i was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that i rushed to get back to the peace of my own room and i was incapable of noticing anything which happened
737177 you say that you returned to your room did you leave it again before next morning
737178 yes when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her
737179 yes he had just returned from the bridge when i saw him he had sent for the doctor and the police
737180 mr gibson is a very strong self contained man i do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface but i who knew him so well could see that he was deeply concerned
737181 then we come to the all important point this pistol that was found in your room had you ever seen it before
737182 yes on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses
737183 you could not guess how long it had been there
737184 that is final then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you
737185 it could only have been at meal time or else at the hours when i would be in the schoolroom with the children
737186 thank you miss dunbar is there any other point which could help me in the investigation
737187 there was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body could you suggest any possible explanation of that
737188 curious miss dunbar very curious why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy and why at the very place
737189 but what could have caused it only great violence could have such an effect
737190 never mind my dear lady you will hear from me mr cummings with the help of the god of justice i will give you a case which will make england ring you will get news by to morrow miss dunbar and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that i have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through
737191 i have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours
737192 yes yes i am a little absent minded in such matters but have you your revolver on you
737193 i believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating
737194 no watson i am very serious there is a test before us if the test comes off all will be clear and the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon one cartridge out now we will replace the other five and put on the safety catch so that increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction
737195 it all depends upon the behaviour of dr watsons revolver
737196 here it is now officer can you give me ten yards of string
737197 now if you please we will get off on what i hope is the last stage of our journey
737198 you have seen me miss my mark before watson i have an instinct for such things and yet it has sometimes played me false it seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at winchester but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one and yet and yet well watson we can but try
737199 you will of course get a grappling hook and you will easily restore my friends revolver you will also find beside it the revolver string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim you can let mr gibson know that i will see him in the morning when steps can be taken for miss dunbars vindication
737200 it must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy wom
737201 we can follow the various steps quite clearly and they show
737202 then she took one of her husbands revolvers there was as you saw an arsenal in the house and kept it for her own use a similar one she concealed that morning in miss dunbars ward robe after discharging one barrel which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention she then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon when miss dunbar ap peared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred and then when she was out of hearing carried out her terrible purpose every link is now in its place and the chain is complete the papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance but it is easy to be wise after the event and in any case the expanse of a reed filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where well watson we have helped a remark able woman and also a formidable man should they in the future join their forces as seems not unlikely the financial world may find that mr neil gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught
737203 you will excuse a certain abstraction of mind my dear watson
737204 some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty four hours and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character i have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective
737205 no no watson that side of the matter is of course obvious but there is another which is far more subtle you may recollect that in the case which you in your sensational way coupled with the copper beeches i was able by watching the mind of the child to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father
737206 my line of thoughts about dogs is analogous a dog reflects the family life whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family or a sad dog in a happy one snarling people have snarling dogs dangerous people have dangerous ones and their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others
737207 the practical application of what i have said is very close to the problem which i am investigating it is a tangled skein you understand and i am looking for a loose end one possible loose end lies in the question why does professor presburys wolf hound roy endeavour to bite him
737208 you never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things but is it not on the face of it strange that a staid elderly philosopher youve heard of presbury of course the famous camford physiologist that such a man whose friend has been his devoted wolf hound should now have been twice attacked by his own dog what do you make of it
737209 well that has to be considered but he attacks no one else nor does he apparently molest his master save on very special occasions curious watson very curious but young mr ben nett is before his time if that is his ring i had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came
737210 con sider the relation in which i stand to professor presbury both privately and publicly i really can hardly justify myself if i speak before any third person
737211 have no fear mr bennett dr watson is the very soul of discretion and i can assure you that this is a matter in which i am very likely to need an assistant
737212 as you like mr holmes you will i am sure understand my having some reserves in the matter
737213 you will appreciate it watson when i tell you that this gentleman mr trevor bennett is professional assistant to the great scientist lives under his roof and is engaged to his only daughter certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion but it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery
737214 i hope so mr holmes that is my one object does dr watson know the situation
737215 then perhaps i had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments
737216 then the current of his life was broken he is sixty one years of age but he became engaged to the daughter of professor morphy his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy it was not as i understand the reasoned courting of an elderly man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover the lady alice morphy was a very perfect girl both in mind and body so that there was every excuse for the professors infatuation none the less it did not meet with full approval in his own family
737217 about this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal
737218 now comes the point from that time onward a curious change came over the professor he became furtive and sly those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities his intellect was not affected his lectures were as brilliant as ever but always there was something new something sinister and unexpected his daughter who was devoted to him tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on you sir as i understand did the same but all was in vain and now mr bennett tell in your own words the incident of the letters
737219 you must understand dr watson that the professor had no secrets from me if i were his son or his younger brother i could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence as his secre tary i handled every paper which came to him and i opened and subdivided his letters shortly after his return all this was changed he told me that certain letters might come to him from london which would be marked by a cross under the stamp these were to be set aside for his own eyes only i may say that several of these did pass through my hands that they had the e c mark and were in an illiterate handwriting if he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter basket in which our correspondence was collected
737220 ah yes the box the professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels it was the one thing which suggested a continental tour for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with germany this he placed in his instru ment cupboard one day in looking for a canula i took up the box to my surprise he was very angry and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity it was the first time such a thing had happened and i was deeply hurt i endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that i had touched the box but all the evening i was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind
737221 i may need some of these dates which you have noted
737222 i learned method among other things from my great teacher from the time that i observed abnormality in his behaviour i felt that it was my duty to study his case thus i have it here that it was on that very day july 2d that roy attacked the professor as he came from his study into the hall again on july 11th there was a scene of the same sort and then i have a note of yet another upon july 20th after that we had to banish roy to the stables he was a dear affectionate animal but i fear i weary you
737223 these details were new to me mr bennett i think we have now fairly gone over the old ground have we not but you spoke of some fresh developments
737224 i have said sir that it was the night before last that is september 4th
737225 he sleeps at the end of the passage and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase it was a really terrifying experience mr holmes i think that i am as strong nerved as my neighbours but i was shaken by what i saw the passage was dark save that one window halfway along it threw a patch of light i could see that something was coming along the passage something dark and crouching then suddenly it emerged into the light and i saw that it was he he was crawling mr holmes crawling he was not quite on his hands and knees i should rather say on his hands and feet with his face sunk between his hands yet he seemed to move with ease i was so paralyzed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that i was able to step forward and ask if i could assist him his answer was extraordinary he sprang up spat out some atrocious word at me and hurried on past me and down the staircase i waited about for an hour but he did not come back it must have been daylight before he regained his room
737226 lumbago possibly i have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way and nothing would be more trying to the temper
737227 good watson you always keep us flat footed on the ground but we can hardly accept lumbago since he was able to stand erect in a moment
737228 in fact he is stronger than i have known him for years but there are the facts mr holmes it is not a case in which we can consult the police and yet we are utterly at our wits end as to what to do and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster edith miss presbury feels as i do that we cannot wait passively any longer
737229 it is certainly a very curious and suggestive case what do you think watson
737230 it appears to be a case for an alienist the old gentlemans cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair he made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion his letters and the box may be connected with some other private trans action a loan perhaps or share cenificates which are in the box
737231 i felt i must follow you oh jack i have been so dreadfully frightened it is awful to be there alone
737232 mr holmes this is the young lady i spoke of this is my fiancee
737233 we were gradually coming to that conclusion were we not watson
737234 i take it miss presbury that there is some fresh development in the case and that you thought we should know
737235 when i found mr bennett had left his hotel i thought i should probably find him here of course he had told me that he would consult you but oh mr holmes can you do nothing for my poor father
737236 i have hopes miss presbury but the case is still obscure perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it
737237 it was last night mr holmes he had been very strange all day i am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does he lives as in a strange dream yesterday was such a day it was not my father with whom i lived his outward shell was there but it was not really he
737238 i was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furi ously poor roy he is chained now near the stable i may say that i always sleep with my door locked for as jack as mr bennett will tell you we all have a feeling of impending danger my room is on the second floor it happened that the blind was up in my window and there was bright moonlight outside as i lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog i was amazed to see my fathers face looking in at me mr holmes i nearly died of surprise and horror there it was pressed against the window pane and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window if that window had opened i think i should have gone mad it was no delusion mr holmes dont deceive yourself by thinking so i dare say it was twenty seconds or so that i lay paralyzed and watched the face then it vanished but i could not i could not spring out of bed and look out after it i lay cold and shivering till morning at breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner and made no allusion to the adventure of the night neither did i but i gave an excuse for coming to town and here i am
737239 my dear young lady you say that your room is on the second floor is there a long ladder in the garden
737240 no mr holmes that is the amazing part of it there is no possible way of reaching the window and yet he was there
737241 this is the second time that you have alluded to the date mr holmes
737242 is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case
737243 it is possible very possible and yet i have not my full material at present
737244 possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon
737245 no i assure you it was quite a different line of thought possibly you can leave your notebook with me and i will check the dates now i think watson that our line of action is perfectly clear this young lady has informed us and i have the greatest confidence in her intuition that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates we will there fore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date he will put it down to his own lack of memory thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him
737246 i warn you however that the professor is irascible and violent at times
737247 there are reasons why we should come at once very cogent reasons if my theories hold good to morrow mr bennett will certainly see us in camford there is if i remember right an inn called the chequers where the port used to be above mediocrity and the linen was above reproach i think watson that our lot for the next few days might lie in less pleasant places
737248 i think watson that we can catch the professor just before lunch he lectures at eleven and should have an interval at home
737249 there was a period of excitement upon august 26th we will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times if we insist that we are there by appointment i think he will hardly venture to contradict us have you the effrontery necessary to put it through
737250 excellent watson compound of the busy bee and excel sior we can but try the motto of the firm a friendly native will surely guide us
737251 pray sit down gentlemen what can i do for you
737252 it was the question which i was about to put to you professor
737253 possibly there is some mistake i heard through a second person that professor presbury of camford had need of my services
737254 you heard that did you may i ask the name of your informant
737255 i am sorry professor but the matter was rather confidential if i have made a mistake there is no harm done i can only express my regret
737256 not at all i should wish to go funher into this matter it interests me have you any scrap of writing any letter or telegram to bear out your assertion
737257 i presume that you do not go so far as to assert that i summoned you
737258 how ever that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid
737259 come in mr bennett these two gentlemen have come from london under the impression that they have been sum moned you handle all my correspondence have you a note of anything going to a person named holmes
737260 i can only repeat that i am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion
737261 you can hardly get out of it so easily as that
737262 consider your position consider the scandal at the university mr holmes is a well known man you cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy
737263 perhaps our intrusion was a little crude and yet we have gained that personal contact which i desired but dear me watson he is surely at our heels the villain still pursues us
737264 i am so sorry mr holmes i wished to apologize
737265 my dear sir there is no need it is all in the way of professional experience
737266 i have never seen him in a more dangerous mood but he grows more sinister you can understand now why his daughter and i are alarmed and yet his mind is perfectly clear
737267 that was my miscalculation it is evident that his memory is much more reliable than i had thought by the way can we before we go see the window of miss presburys room
737268 dear me it seems hardly accessible and yet you will observe that there is a creeper below and a water pipe above which give some foothold
737269 very likely it would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man
737270 there was one other thing i wish to tell you mr holmes i have the address of the man in london to whom the professor writes he seems to have written this morning and i got it from his blotting paper it is an ignoble position for a trusted secre tary but what else can i do
737271 dorak a curious name slavonic i imagine well it is an important link in the chain we return to london this afternoon mr bennett i see no good purpose to be served by our remain ing we cannot arrest the professor because he has done no crime nor can we place him under constraint for he cannot be proved to be mad no action is as yet possible
737272 then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past meanwhile let him have his way and do not cross him so long as he is in a good humour all is well
737273 i expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together
737274 he struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain from the little i saw of him explosive no doubt but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it i rather fancy that friend bennett is in for an uncomfortable time
737275 he is my general utility man who looks up routine business it was important to know something of the man with whom our professor was so secretly corresponding his nationality connects up with the prague visit
737276 at present we seem to be faced by a long series of
737277 this excellent young mans diary shows that there was trouble upon july 2d and from then onward it seems to have been at nine day intervals with so far as i remember only one excep tion thus the last outbreak upon friday was on september 3d which also falls into the series as did august 26th which preceded it the thing is beyond coincidence
737278 let us then form the provisional theory that every nine days the professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect his naturally violent nature is inten sified by it he learned to take this drug while he was in prague and is now supplied with it by a bohemian intermediary in london this all hangs together watson
737279 but the dog the face at the window the creeping man in the passage
737280 well well we have made a beginning i should not expect any fresh developments until next tuesday in the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend bennett and enjoy the ameni ties of this charming town
737281 he has actually more energy and vitality than i can ever remember nor was his brain ever clearer but its not he its never the man whom we have known
737282 i dont think you have anything to fear now for a week at least
737283 i am a busy man and dr watson has his patients to attend to let us agree that we meet here at this hour next tuesday and i shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain even if we cannot perhaps put an end to your troubles meanwhile keep us posted in what occurs
737284 he heard from his london correspondent to day there was a letter and there was a small packet each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them there has been nothing else
737285 now mr bennett we shall i think come to some conclusion to night if my deductions are correct we should have an opportu nity of bringing matters to a head in order to do so it is necessary to hold the professor under observation i would sug gest therefore that you remain awake and on the lookout should you hear him pass your door do not interrupt him but follow him as discreetly as you can dr watson and i will not be far off by the way where is the key of that little box of which you spoke
737286 i fancy our researches must lie in that direction at the worst the lock should not be very formidable have you any other able bodied man on the premises
737287 we might possibly want him well we can do no more until we see how things develop good bye but i expect that we shall see you before morning
737288 if the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the professor at his worst to night
737289 the fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to prague that he is in secret correspondence with a bohemian dealer in london who presumably represents someone in prague and that he received a packet from him this very day all point in one direction what he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken but that it emanates in some way from prague is clear enough he takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth day system which was the first point which attracted my attention but his symptoms are most remarkable did you ob serve his knuckles
737290 thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experi
737291 oh watson watson what a fool i have been it seems incredible and yet it must be true all points in one direction how could i miss seeing the connection of ideas those knuckles how could i have passed those knuckles and the dog and the ivy its surely time that i disappeared into that little farm of my dreams look out watson here he is we shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves
737292 ive seen him at it before i knew the dog would get him sooner or later
737293 at present the scandal is confined to our own household it is safe with us if it gets beyond these walls it will never stop consider his position at the university his european reputation the feelings of his daughter
737294 i think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand the key from the watch chain mr bennett macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change let us see what we can find in the profes sors mysterious box
737295 the great black faced monkey of the himalayan slopes big gest and most human of climbing monkeys many details are added well thanks to you mr holmes it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source
737296 lies of course in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man when one tries to rise above nature one is liable to fall below it the highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny
737297 when i have written to this man and told him that i hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he cir culates we will have no more trouble but it may recur others may find a better way there is danger there a very real danger to humanity consider watson that the material the sensual the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives the spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher it would be the survival of the least fit what sort of cesspool may not our poor world become
737298 i think there is nothing more to be said mr bennett the various incidents will now fit themselves easily into the general scheme the dog of course was aware of the change far more quickly than you his smell would insure that it was the monkey not the professor whom roy attacked just as it was the monkey who teased roy climbing was a joy to the creature and it was a mere chance i take it that the pastime brought him to the young ladys win dow there is an early train to town watson but i think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the chequers before we catch it
737299 for a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval of the practical and of the wildly fanciful i think this is surely the limit
737300 matilda briggs was not the name of a young woman wat son
737301 it was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of sumatra a story for which the world is not yet prepared but what do we know about vampires does it come within our purview either anything is better than stagnation but really we seem to have been switched on to a grimms fairy tale make a long arm watson and see what v has to say
737302 that was a bad business i have some recollection that you made a record of it watson though i was unable to congratulate you upon the result victor lynch the forger venomous lizard or gila remarkable case that vittoria the circus belle vanderbilt and the yegg man vipers vigor the hammersmith wonder hullo hullo good old index you cant beat it listen to this watson vampirism in hungary and again vampires in transylvania
737303 rubbish watson rubbish what have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts its pure lunacy
737304 the vampire was not necessarily a dead man a living person might have the habit i have read for example of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth
737305 you are right watson it mentions the legend in one of these references but are we to give serious attention to such things this agency stands flat footed upon the ground and there it must remain the world is big enough for us no ghosts need apply i fear that we cannot take mr robert ferguson very seriously possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him
737306 i know that country holmes it is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago you get odleys and harveys and carritons the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses
737307 i rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about cheesemans lamberley before we are through the letter is as i had hoped from robert ferguson by the way he claims acquaintance with you
737308 big bob ferguson the finest three quarter richmond ever had he was always a good natured chap its like him to be so concerned over a friends case
737309 we must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak minded of course it is his case send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning
737310 you dont look quite the man you did when i threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the old deer park i expect i have changed a bit also but its this last day or two that has aged me i see by your telegram mr holmes that it is no use my pretending to be anyones deputy
737311 of course it is but you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help what can i do how am i to go to the police with such a story and yet the kiddies have got to be protected is it madness mr holmes is it something in the blood have you any similar case in your experience for gods sake give me some advice for i am at my wits end
737312 very naturally mr ferguson now sit here and pull your self together and give me a few clear answers i can assure you that i am very far from being at my wits end and that i am confident we shall find some solution first of all tell me what steps you have taken is your wife still near the children
737313 we had a dreadful scene she is a most loving woman mr holmes if ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul she loves me she was cut to the heart that i should have discovered this horrible this incredible secret she would not even speak she gave no answer to my reproaches save to gaze at me with a sort of wild despairing look in her eyes then she rushed to her room and locked herself in since then she has refused to see me she has a maid who was with her before her marriage dolores by name a friend rather than a servant she takes her food to her
737314 mrs mason the nurse has sworn that she will not leave it night or day i can absolutely trust her i am more uneasy about poor little jack for as i told you in my note he has twice been assaulted by her
737315 no she struck him savagely it is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple
737316 you would think that the dear lads condition would soften anyones heart a fall in childhood and a twisted spine mr holmes but the dearest most loving heart within
737317 what other inmates are there in your house mr ferguson
737318 two servants who have not been long with us one stable hand michael who sleeps in the house my wife myself my boy jack baby dolores and mrs mason that is all
737319 i gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage
737320 then your wifes character would really be better known by dolores than by you
737321 that i may be of more use at lamberley than here it is eminently a case for personal investigation if the lady remains in her room our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her of course we would stay at the inn
737322 it is what i hoped mr holmes there is an excellent train at two from victoria if you could come
737323 of course we could come there is a lull at present i can give you my undivided energies watson of course comes with us but there are one or two points upon which i wish to be very sure before i start this unhappy lady as i understand it has appeared to assault both the children her own baby and your little son
737324 but the assaults take different forms do they not she has beaten your son
737325 once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands
737326 none save that she hated him again and again she said so
737327 well that is not unknown among stepmothers a posthu mous jealousy we will say is the lady jealous by nature
737328 yes she is very jealous jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love
737329 but the boy he is fifteen i understand and probably very developed in mind since his body has been circumscribed in action did he give you no explanation of these assaults
737330 never in the world could there be so devoted a son my life is his life he is absorbed in what i say or do
737331 no doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage you were thrown very close together were you not
737332 and the boy having so affectionate a nature was devoted no doubt to the memory of his mother
737333 he would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad there is one other point about these assaults were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon yow son at the same period
737334 in the first case it was so it was as if some frenzy had seized her and she had vented her rage upon both in the second case it was only jack who suffered mrs mason had no complaint to make about the baby
737335 possibly not one forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them a bad habit mr ferguson but human nature is weak i fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods however i will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble and that you may expect to find us at victoria at two oclock
737336 thats what puzzled the vet a sort of paralysis spinal meningitis he thought but it is passing hell be all right soon wont you carlo
737337 for gods sake what do you think mr holmes it may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you but it is life and death to me my wife a would be murderer my child in constant danger dont play with me mr holmes it is too terribly serious
737338 i fear that there is pain for you mr ferguson whatever the solution may be
737339 i would spare you all i can i cannot say more for the instant but before i leave this house i hope i may have something definite
737340 please god you may if you will excuse me gentlemen i will go up to my wifes room and see if there has been any change
737341 she no ask for food she verra ill she need doctor i frightened stay alone with her without doctor
737342 i should be so glad if i could be of use
737343 i take him i no ask leave she needs doctor
737344 she lie like that one day two day i fraid she die
737345 i will not see him i will not see him
737346 a fiend a fiend oh what shall i do with this devil
737347 no no one can help it is finished all is destroyed do what i will all is destroyed
737348 your husband loves you dearly he is deeply grieved at this happening
737349 he loves me yes but do i not love him do i not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart that is how i love him and yet he could think of me he could speak of me so
737350 no no i cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face i will not see him go now you can do nothing for me tell him only one thing i want my child i have a right to my child that is the only message i can send him
737351 how do i know what strange impulse might come upon her how can i ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips
737352 the child is safe with mrs mason and there he must remain
737353 i did not know that you were due yet i should have been here to meet you oh i am so glad to see you
737354 i came early because my friends mr holmes and dr watson have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us
737355 good bye little man you have made a strange start in life nurse i should wish to have a word with you in private
737356 your anxiety will soon i hope be set at rest
737357 not very prepossessing externally as you can see but a heart of gold and devoted to the child
737358 i really feel that i have brought you on a fools errand for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy it must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view
737359 but i have not been struck up to now with its complex ity it has been a case for intellectual deduction but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal i had in fact reached it before we left baker street and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation
737360 if you can see the truth in this matter do not keep me in suspense how do i stand what shall i do i care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them
737361 certainly i owe you an explanation and you shall have it but you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way is the lady capable of seeing us watson
737362 very good it is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up let us go up to her
737363 oh very well madame if you would rather she stayed i can see no objection now mr ferguson i am a busy man wlth many calls and my methods have to be short and direct the swiftest surgery is the least painful let me first say what will ease your mind your wife is a very good a very loving and a very ill used woman
737364 prove that mr holmes and i am your debtor forever
737365 i will do so but in doing so i must wound you deeply in another direction
737366 i care nothing so long as you clear my wife everything on earth is insignificant compared to that
737367 let me tell you then the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in baker street the idea of a vampire was to me absurd such things do not happen in criminal practice in england and yet your observation was precise you had seen the lady rise from beside the childs cot with the blood upon her lips
737368 did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it was there not a queen in english history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it
737369 and the dog if one were to use such a poison would one not
737370 now do you understand your wife feared such an attack she saw it made and saved the childs life and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart
737371 i watched him as you fondled the child just now his face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background i saw such jealousy such cruel hatred as i have seldom seen in a human face
737372 you have to face it mr ferguson it is the more painful because it is a distorted love a maniacal exaggerated love for you and possibly for his dead mother which has prompted his action his very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness
737373 how could i tell you bob i felt the blow it would be to you it was better that i should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine when this gentleman who seems to have powers of magic wrote that he knew all i was glad
737374 i think a year at sea would be my prescription for master jacky
737375 only one thing is still clouded madame we can quite understand your attacks upon master jacky there is a limit to a mothers patience but how did you dare to leave the child these last two days
737376 this i fancy is the time for our exit watson
737377 if you will take one elbow of the too faithful dolores i will take the other there now
737378 i think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves
737379 there is a chance for you to make some money friend watson
737380 well if you can lay your hand upon a garrideb theres money in it
737381 ah thats a long story rather a whimsical one too i dont think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular the fellow will be here presently for cross examination so i wont open the matter up till he comes but meanwhile thats the name we want
737382 i am afraid you must make yet another effort watson
737383 this gentle man is also in the plot already though i certainly did not expect to see him this morning however he is in a position to tell us a good deal which i want to know
737384 ah yes your pictures are not unlike you sir if i may say so i believe you have had a letter from my namesake mr nathan garrideb have you not
737385 we shall i fancy have a good deal to discuss
737386 you are of course the mr john garrideb mentioned in this document but surely you have been in england some time
737387 ive read of your tricks mr holmes but i never thought i would be the subject of them where do you read that
737388 the shoulder cut of your coat the toes of your boots could anyone doubt it
737389 well well i had no idea i was so obvious a britisher but business brought me over here some time ago and so as you say my outfit is nearly all london however i guess your time is of value and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks what about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand
737390 dr watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter but why did mr nathan garrideb not come with you
737391 why did he ever drag you into it at all
737392 what in thunder had you to do with it here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen and one of them must needs call in a detective i saw him this morning and he told me this fool trick he had played me and thats why i am here but i feel bad about it all the same
737393 there was no reflection upon you mr garrideb it was simply zeal upon his part to gain your end an end which is i understand equally vital for both of you he knew that i had means of getting information and therefore it was very natural that he should apply to me
737394 when i went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective i just asked for your address and came right away i dont want police butting into a private matter but if you are content just to help us find the man there can be no harm in that
737395 and now sir since you are here we had best have a clear account from your own lips my friend here knows nothing of the details
737396 well theres no reason it should be kept a secret ill give
737397 he had no kith nor kin or if he had i never heard of it
737398 for he died within a year of saying them and he left a will
737399 it was so big a chance that i just let my legal practice slide and i set forth looking for garridebs there is not one in the united states i went through it sir with a fine toothed comb and never a garrideb could i catch then i tried the old country sure enough there was the name in the london telephone direc tory i went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him but he is a lone man like myself with some women relations but no men it says three adult men in the will so you see we still have a vacancy and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges
737400 l said it was rather whimsical did i not i should have thought sir that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers
737401 dear me well it is certainly a most curious little problem i may take a glance at it in my leisure by the way it is curious that you should have come from topeka i used to have a correspondent he is dead now old dr lysander starr who was mayor in 1890
737402 his name is still honoured well mr holmes i suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress i reckon you will hear within a day or two
737403 i was wondering watson what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies i nearly asked him so for there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy but i judged it better to let him think he had fooled us here is a man with an english coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a years wear and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial american lately landed in london there have been no advertisements in the agony columns you know that i miss nothing there they are my favourite covert for putting up a bird and i would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that i never knew a dr lysander starr of topeka touch him where you would he was false i think the fellow is really an american but he has worn his accent smooth with years of london what is his game then and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for garridebs its worth our attention for granting that the man is a rascal he is certainly a complex and ingenious one we must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also just ring him up watson
737404 yes yes i am mr nathan garrideb is mr holmes there i should very much like to have a word with mr holmes
737405 yes he has been here i understand that you dont know him how long only two days yes yes of course it is a most captivating prospect will you be at home this evening i suppose your namesake will not be there very good we will come then for i would rather have a chat without him dr watson will come with me i under stand from your note that you did not go out often well we shall be round about six you need not mention it to the american lawyer very good good bye
737406 its his real name anyhow and that is something to note
737407 they degenerated greatly towards the end at their best i hold them supreme though some prefer the alexandrian school you will find a chair here mr holmes pray allow me to clear these bones and you sir ah yes dr watson if you would have the goodness to put the japanese vase to one side you see round me my little interests in life my doctor lectures me about never going out but why should i go out when i have so much to hold me here i can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months
737408 but do you tell me that you never go out
737409 now and again i drive down to sothebys or christies otherwise i very seldom leave my room i am not too strong and my researches are very absorbing but you can imagine mr holmes what a terrific shock pleasant but terrific it was for me when i heard of this unparalleled good fortune it only needs one more garrideb to complete the matter and surely we can find one i had a brother but he is dead and female relatives are disqualified but there must surely be others in the world i had heard that you handled strange cases and that was why i sent to you of course this american gentleman is quite right and i should have taken his advice first but i acted for the best
737410 but are you really anxious to acquire an estate in america
737411 certainly not sir nothing would induce me to leave my collection but this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim five million dollars was the sum named there are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection and which i am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds just think what i could do with five million dollars why i have the nucleus of a national collection i shall be the hans sloane of my age
737412 i merely called to make your acquaintance and there is no reason why i should interrupt your studies
737413 i prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom i do business there are few questions i need ask for i have your very clear narrative in my pocket and i filled up the blanks when this american gentleman called i understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence
737414 yes he came straight back to me he had been very angry
737415 he seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour but he was quite cheerful again when he returned
737416 has he had or asked for any money from you
737417 have you any articles of great value in your collection
737418 no sir i am not a rich man it is a good collection but not a very valuable one
737419 i thought i should be in time to get you mr nathan garrideb my congratulations you are a rich man sir our business is happily finished and all is well as to you mr holmes we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble
737420 and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper we must hustle and put the thing through i have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office to morrow afternoon at four oclock
737421 what do you say mr holmes dont you think it would be wiser here am i a wandering american with a wonderful tale why should he believe what i tell him but you are a britisher wth solid references and he is bound to take notice of what you say i would go with you if you wished but i have a very busy day to morrow and i could always follow you if you are in any trouble
737422 well i have not made such a journey for years
737423 it is nothing mr garrideb i have figured out our connec tions you leave at twelve and should be there soon after two then you can be back the same night all you have to do is to see this man explain the matter and get an affidavit of his existence by the lord
737424 considering ive come all the way from the centre of america it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through
737425 it is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life
737426 and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can
737427 ill have to get on ill call to morrow mr nathan and see you off to birmingham coming my way mr holmes well then good bye and we may have good news for you to morrow night
737428 i wish i could look over your collection mr garrideb
737429 in my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful and this room of yours is a storehouse of it
737430 i had always heard sir that you were a very intelligent man
737431 i could take you round now if you have the time
737432 unfortunately i have not but these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal expla nation if i should be able to look in to morrow i presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them
737433 none at all you are most welcome the place will of course be shut up but mrs saunders is in the basement up to four oclock and would let you in with her key
737434 well i happen to be clear to morrow afternoon if you would say a word to mrs saunders it would be quite in order by the way who is your house agent
737435 i am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses
737436 i was wondering if this was queen anne or georgian
737437 really i should have thought a little earlier however it is easily ascertained well good bye mr garrideb and may you have every success in your birmingham journey
737438 no doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind
737439 the head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to morrow did you notice nothing curious about that adver tisement
737440 oh you did notice that did you come watson you improve all the time yes it was bad english but good ameri can the printer had set it up as received then the buckboards that is american also and artesian wells are commoner with them than with us it was a typical american advertisement but purporting to be from an english firm what do you make of that
737441 i can only suppose that this american lawyer put it in himself what his object was i fail to understand
737442 well there are alternative explanations anyhow he wanted to get this good old fossil up to birmingham that is very clear i might have told him that he was clearly going on a wild goose chase but on second thoughts it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go to morrow watson well to morrow will speak for itself
737443 this is a more serious matter than i had expected watson
737444 it is fair to tell you so though i know it will only be an additional reason to you for running your head into danger i should know my watson by now but there is danger and you should know it
737445 well it is not the first we have shared holmes i hope it may not be the last what is the particular danger this time
737446 we are up against a very hard case i have identified mr john garrideb counsellor at law he is none other than killer evans of sinister and murderous reputation
737447 ah it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable newgate calendar in your memory i have been down to see friend lestrade at the yard there may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there but they lead the world for thoroughness and method i had an idea that we might get on the track of our american friend in their records sure enough i found his chubby face smiling up at me from the rogues portrait gallery james winter alias morecroft alias killer evans was the inscription below
737448 i scribbled down a few points from his dossier aged forty four native of chicago known to have shot three men in the states escaped from penitentiary through political influ ence came to london in 1893 shot a man over cards in a night club in the waterloo road in january 1895 man died but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row dead man was identified as rodger prescott famous as forger and coiner in chicago killer evans released in 1901 has been under police supervision since but so far as known has led an honest life very dangerous man usually carries arms and is prepared to use them that is our bird watson a sporting bird as you must admit
737449 well it begins to define itself i have been to the house agents our client as he told us has been there five years it was unlet for a year before then the previous tenant was a gentleman at large named waldron waldrons appearance was well remembered at the office he had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him he was a tall bearded man with very dark features now prescott the man whom killer evans had shot was according to scotland yard a tall dark man with a beard as a working hypothesis i think we may take it that prescott the american criminal used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum so at last we get a link you see
737450 i have my old favourite with me if our wild west friend tries to live up to his nickname we must be ready for him ill give you an hour for a siesta watson and then i think it will be time for our ryder street adventure
737451 he wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room that is
737452 well that is what we are here to find out it has nothing whatever to do with our client so far as i can read the situation it is something connected with the man he murdered the man who may have been his confederate in crime there is some guilty secret in the room that is how i read it at first i thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knew something worth the attention of a big criminal but the fact that rodger prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason well watson we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring
737453 i guess you have been one too many for me mr holmes saw
737454 youre not hurt watson for gods sake say that you are not hurt
737455 by the lord it is as well for you if you had killed watson you would not have got out of this room alive now sir what have you to say for yourself
737456 the greatest counterfeiter london ever saw thats prescotts machine and those bundles on the table are two thousand of prescotts notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere help yourselves gentlemen call it a deal and let me beat it
737457 we dont do things like that mr evans there is no bolt hole for you in this country you shot this man prescott did you not
737458 yes sir and got five years for it though it was he who pulled on me five years when i should have had a medal the size of a soup plate no living man could tell a prescott from a bank of england and if i hadnt put him out he would have flooded london with them i was the only one in the world who knew where he made them can you wonder that i wanted to get to the place and can you wonder that when i found this crazy boob of a bug hunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it and never quitting his room i had to do the best i could to shift him maybe i would have been wiser if i had put him away it would have been easy enough but im a soft hearted guy that cant begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also but say mr holmes what have i done wrong anyhow ive not used this plant ive not hurt this old stiff where do you get me
737459 but thats not our job they take that at the next stage what we wanted at present was just your sweet self please give the yard a call watson it wont be entirely unexpected
737460 it may be some fussy self important fool it may be a matter of life or death
737461 i need not say that i have confirmed it watson
737462 only that this name is a household word in society
737463 well i can tell you a little more than that he has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers you may remember his negotiations with sir george lewis over the hammerford will case he is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy i am bound therefore to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance
737464 then you have the hour 4 30 until then we can put the matter out of our heads
737465 his collaboration may be very necessary for we are dealing on this occasion mr holmes with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will literally stick at nothing i should say that there is no more dangerous man in europe
737466 i have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied
737467 dont you smoke then you will excuse me if i light my pipe if your man is more dangerous than the late professor moriarty or than the living colonel sebastian moran then he is indeed worth meeting may i ask his name
737468 there is no getting past you mr holmes wonderful so you have already sized him up as a murderer
737469 it is my business to follow the details of continental crime who could possibly have read what happened at prague and have any doubts as to the mans guilt it was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him i am as sure that he killed his wife when the so called accident happened in the splugen pass as if i had seen him do it i knew also that he had come to england and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do well what has baron gruner been up to i presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again
737470 no it is more serious than that to revenge crime is important but to prevent it is more so it is a terrible thing mr holmes to see a dreadful event an atrocious situation preparing itself before your eyes to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it can a human being be placed in a more trying position
737471 then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests i am acting
737472 i did not understand that you were merely an intermediary who is the principal
737473 mr holmes i must beg you not to press that question it is important that i should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter his motives are to the last degree honourable and chivalrous but he prefers to remain unknown i need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand surely the actual name of your client is immaterial
737474 i am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases but to have it at both ends is too confusing i fear sir james that i must decline to act
737475 you hardly realize the effect of your own action mr holmes
737476 you place me in a most serious dilemma for i am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if i could give you the facts and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all may i at least lay all that i can before you
737477 by all means so long as it is understood that i commit myself to nothing
737478 that is understood in the first place you have no doubt heard of general de merville
737479 de merville of khyber fame yes i have heard of him
737480 he has a daughter violet de merville young rich beautiful accomplished a wonder woman in every way it is this daughter this lovely innocent girl whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend
737481 the strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned the hold of love the fellow is as you may have heard extraordinarily handsome with a most fascinating manner a gentle voice and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman he is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact
737482 but how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of miss violet de merville
737483 it was on a mediterranean yachting voyage the company though select paid their own passages no doubt the promoters hardly realized the barons true character until it was too late the villain attached himself to the lady and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart to say that she loves him hardly expresses it she dotes upon him she is obsessed by him outside of him there is nothing on earth she will not hear one word against him everything has been done to cure her of her madness but in vain to sum up she proposes to marry him next month as she is of age and has a will of iron it is hard to know how to prevent her
737484 the cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr she absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other
737485 dear me but surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client it is no doubt general de merville
737486 i could deceive you by saying so mr holmes but it would not be true de merville is a broken man the strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident he has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak doddering old man utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant forceful rascal like this austrian my client however is an old friend one who has known the general intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks he cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it there is nothing in which scotland yard can act it was his own suggestion that you should be called in but it was as i have said on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter i have no doubt mr holmes with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me but i must ask you as a point of honour to refrain from doing so and not to break in upon his incognito
737487 i may add that your problem interests me and that i shall be prepared to look into it how shall i keep in touch with you
737488 the carlton club will find me but in case of emergency there is a private
737489 vernon lodge near kingston it is a large house he has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist
737490 apart from what you have told me can you give me any further information about the man
737491 he has expensive tastes he is a horse fancier for a short time he played polo at hurlingham but then this prague affair got noised about and he had to leave he collects books and pictures he is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature he is i believe a recognized authority upon chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject
737492 all great criminals have that my old friend charlie peace was a violin virtuoso wainwright was no mean artist i could quote many more well sir james you will inform your client that i am turning my mind upon baron gruner i can say no more i have some sources of information of my own and i dare say we may find some means of opening the matter up
737493 i should think you had better see the young lady herself
737494 my dear watson if her poor old broken father cannot move her how shall i a stranger prevail and yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails but i think we must begin from a different angle i rather fancy that shinwell johnson might be a help
737495 he may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld for it is down there amid the black roots of crime that we must hunt for this mans secrets
737496 but if the lady will not accept what is already known why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose
737497 who knows watson womans heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the
737498 oh to be sure i had not told you of my plans well watson i love to come to close grips with my man i like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of when i had given johnson his instructions i took a cab out to kingston and found the baron in a most affable mood
737499 there was no difficulty about that for i simply sent in my card he is an excellent antagonist cool as ice silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants and poisonous as a cobra he has breeding in him a real aristocrat of crime with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it yes i am glad to have had my attention called to baron adelbert gruner
737500 a purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice some peoples affability
737501 my dear man said he you will only ruin your own well deserved
737502 it is curious i answered but that was the very advice which i had
737503 the baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose like the short
737504 excuse my amusement mr holmes said he but it is really funny to see
737505 so i know iet me make the thing clear to you for my own hand is so
737506 well watson there seemed to be no more to say so i took my leave
737507 by the way mr holmes said he did you know le brun the french
737508 i heard that he was beaten by some apaches in the montmartre district
737509 quite true mr holmes by a curious coincidence he had been inquiring
737510 so there you are watson you are up to date now
737511 mighty dangerous i disregard the blusterer but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means
737512 must you interfere does it really matter if he marries the girl
737513 considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife i should say it mattered very much besides the client well well we need not discuss that when you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me for the blithe shinwell will be there with his report
737514 what she dont know well there shell speak for herself put my hand right on her mr holmes within an hour of your message
737515 hell london gets me every time same address for porky shinwell were old mates porky you and i but by cripes there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world that is the man you are after mr holmes
737516 if i can help to put him where he belongs im yours to the rattle
737517 you neednt go into my past mr holmes thats neither here nor there but what i am adelbert gruner made me if i could pull him down
737518 oh if i could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many
737519 porky shinwell has been telling me hes after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time you want to stop it well you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him
737520 she is not in her senses she is madly in love she has been told all about him she cares nothing
737521 aint i a proof myself if i stood before her and told her how he used
737522 well it might be worth trying but he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her and i understand she will not reopen the question
737523 i caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss he would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say he died within a month it wasnt hot air either but i took little notice you see i loved him myself at that time whatever he did went with me same as with this poor fool there was just one thing that shook me yes by cripes if it had not been for his poisonous lying tongue that explains and soothes id have left him that very night its a book he has a brown leather book with a lock and his arms in gold on the outside i think he was a bit drunk that night or he would not have shown it to me
737524 i tell you mr holmes this man collects women and takes a pride in his collection as some men collect moths or butterflies he had it all in that book snapshot photographs names details everything about them it was a beastly book a book no man even if he had come from the gutter could have put together but it was adelbert gruners book all the same souls i have ruined he could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded however thats neither here nor there for the book would not serve you and if it would you cant get it
737525 how can i tell you where it is now its more than a year since i left him i know where he kept it then hes a precise tidy cat of a man in many of his ways so maybe it is still in the pigeon hole of the old bureau in the inner study do you know his house
737526 have you though you havent been slow on the job if you only started this morning maybe dear adelbert has met his match this time the outer study is the one with the chinese crockery in it big glass cupboard between the windows then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study a small room where he keeps papers and things
737527 adelbert is no coward his worst enemy couldnt say that of him he can look after himself theres a burglar alarm at night besides what is there for a burglar unless they got away with all this fancy crockery
737528 no fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell
737529 well now miss winter if you would call here to
737530 i am not out for money let me see this man in the mud and ive got all ive worked for in the mud with my foot on his cursed face thats my price im with you to morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track porky here can tell you always where to find me
737531 i dont quite know how to make her clear to you watson perhaps you may
737532 she knew what we had come for of course that villain had lost no time
737533 well sir said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg your
737534 i was sorry for her watson i thought of her for the moment as i would
737535 i have listened to you with patience mr holmes said she the effect
737536 i was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind if ever you
737537 ill tell you who i am she cried springing out of her chair her
737538 i should prefer not to discuss such matters said miss de merville
737539 three passages screamed my companion you fool you unutterable fool
737540 mr holmes i beg that you will bring this interview to an end said
737541 with an oath miss winter darted forward and if i had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair i dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene for she was beside herself with rage in a cold way i felt pretty furious myself watson for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save so now once again you know exactly how we stand and it is clear that i must plan some fresh opening move for this gambit wont work ill keep in touch with you watson for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us
737542 two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises several stitches have been necessary morphine has been injected and quiet is essential but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden
737543 im a bit of a single stick expert as you know i took most of them on my guard it was the second man that was too much for me
737544 what can i do holmes of course it was that damned fellow who set them on ill go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word
737545 good old watson no we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men but their get away had been well prepared we may be sure of that wait a little i have my plans the first thing is to exaggerate my injuries theyll come to you for news put it on thick watson lucky if i live the week out concussion delirium what you like you cant overdo it
737546 oh hes all right he shall see the worst side of me ill look after that
737547 yes tell shinwell johnson to get that girl out of the way those beauties will be after her now they know of course that she was with me in the case if they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her that is urgent do it to night
737548 put my pipe on the table and the tobacco slipper right come in each morning and we will plan our campaign
737549 only three clear days i believe the rascal wants to put himself out of dangers way but he wont watson by the lord harry he wont now watson i want you to do something for me
737550 well then spend the next twenty four hours in an intensive study of chinese pottery
737551 is the very impression which i intended to convey and now watson have you learned your lessons
737552 good you could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject
737553 it needs careful handling watson this is the real egg shell pottery of the ming dynasty no finer piece ever passed through christies a complete set of this would be worth a kings ransom in fact it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of peking the sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild
737554 that is your name for the evening watson you will call upon baron gruner i know something of his habits and at half past eight he would probably be disengaged a note will tell him in advance that you are about to call and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of ming china you may as well be a medical man since that is a part which you can play without duplicity you are a collector this set has come your way you have heard of the barons interest in the subject and you are not averse to selling at a price
737555 well asked watson you would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares this saucer was got for me by sir james and comes i understand from the collection of his client you will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world
737556 i could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert
737557 excellent watson you scintillate to day suggest christie or sotheby your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself
737558 oh yes he will see you he has the collection mania in its most acute form and especially on this subject on which he is an acknowledged authority sit down watson and i will dictate the letter no answer needed you will merely say that you are coming and why
737559 i was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether i could really afford to add to them this little tang specimen which dates from the seventh century would probably interest you i am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze have you the ming saucer with you of which you spoke
737560 and you say you have a set of six to correspond what puzzles me is that i should not have heard of such magnificent specimens i only know of one in england to match this and it is certainly not likely to be in the market would it be indiscreet if i were to ask you dr hill barton how you obtained this
737561 you can see that the piece is genuine and as to the value i am content to take an experts valuation
737562 in dealing with objects of such value one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction that the piece is genuine is certain i have no doubts at all about that but suppose i am bound to take every possibility into account that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell
737563 i would guarantee you against any claim of the son
737564 that of course would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth
737565 quite so and yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual
737566 i have given you the first offer as i understood that you were a connoisseur but i shall have no difficulty in other quaerers
737567 i was aware that you had written a book upon the subject
737568 dear me this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand you are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held how do you explain that
737569 i am a very busy man i am a doctor in practice
737570 that is no answer if a man has a hobby he follows it up whatever his other pursuits may be you said in your note that you were a connoisseur
737571 might i ask you a few questions to test you i am obliged to tell you doctor if you are indeed a doctor that the incident becomes more and more suspicious i would ask you what do you know of the emperor shomu and how do you associate him with the shoso in near nara dear me does that puzzle you tell me a little about the nonhern wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics
737572 i came here to do you a favour and not to be examined as if i were a schoolboy my knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own but i certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way
737573 what is the game you are here as a spy you are an emissary of holmes this is a trick that you are playing upon me the fellow is dying i hear so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me youve made your way in here without leave and by god you may find it harder to get out than to get in
737574 oh the she devil she shall pay for it she shall pay oh god in heaven this pain is more than i can bear
737575 sooner or later it will always come god knows there was sin enough
737576 here is the book the woman talked of if this will not break off the marriage nothing ever could but it will watson it must no self respecting woman could stand it
737577 or his lust diary call it what you will the moment the woman told us of it i realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it i said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts for this woman might have given it away but i brooded over it then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the baron think that no precautions need be taken against me that was all to the good i would have waited a little longer but his visit to america forced my hand he would never have left so compromising a document behind him therefore we had to act at once burglary at night is impossible he takes precautions but there was a chance in the evening if i could only be sure that his attention was engaged that was where you and your blue saucer came in but i had to be sure of the position of the book and i knew i had only a few minutes in which to act for my time was limited by your knowledge of chinese pottery therefore i gathered the girl up at the last moment how could i guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak i thought she had come altogether on my business but it seems she had some of her own
737578 i feared he would but you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book though not long enough for an unobserved escape ah sir james i am very glad you have come
737579 but if these injuries are as terrible as dr watson describes then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book
737580 women of the de merville type do not act like that she would love him the more as a disfigured martyr no no it is his moral side not his physical which we have to destroy that book will bring her back to earth and i know nothing else that could it is in his own writing she cannot get past it
737581 see here masser holmes you keep your hands out of other folks busi ness leave folks to manage their own affairs got that masser holmes
737582 it wont be so damn fine if i have to trim you up a bit ive handled your kind before now and they didnt look fine when i was through with them look at that masser holmes
737583 ive a friend thats interested out harrow way you know what im meaning and he dont intend to have no buttin in by you got that you aint the law and i aint the law either and if you come in ill be on hand also dont you forget it
737584 i wont ask you to sit down for i dont like the smell of you but arent you steve dixie the bruiser
737585 thats my name masser holmes and youll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip
737586 but it was the killing of young perkins outside the holborn bar what youre not going
737587 what have i to do with this ere perkins masser holmes i was trainin at the bull ring in birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble
737588 thats enough get out of it ill pick you up when i want you
737589 good mornin masser holmes i hope there aint no hard feelins about this ere visit
737590 there will be unless you tell me who sent you
737591 why there aint no secret about that masser holmes it was that same genlman that you have just done gone mention
737592 selp me i dont know masser holmes he just say steve you go see mr holmes and tell him his life aint safe if he go down harrow way thats the whole truth
737593 i am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head watson i observed your manoeuvres with the poker but he is really rather a harmless fellow a great muscular foolish blus tering baby and easily cowed as you have seen he is one of the spencer john gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which i may clear up when i have time his immediate principal barney is a more astute person they specialize in assaults intimidation and the like what i want to know is who is at the back of them on this panicular occasion
737594 it is this harrow weald case it decides me to look into the matter for if it is worth anyones while to take so much trouble there must be something in it
737595 i was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude here is mrs maberleys note if you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once
737596 and now if you can spare the time watson we will get upon our way
737597 though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter
737598 probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son douglas
737599 dear me are you the mother of douglas maberley i knew him slightly but of course all london knew him what a magnificent creature he was where is he now
737600 dead mr holmes dead he was attache at rome and he died there of pneumonia last month
737601 i am sorry one could not connect death with such a man i have never known anyone so vitally alive he lived intensely every fibre of him
737602 too intensely mr holmes that was the ruin of him you remember him as he was debonair and splendid you did not see the moody morose brooding creature into which he devel oped his heart was broken in a single month i seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn out cynical man
737603 or a fiend well it was not to talk of my poor lad that i asked you to come mr holmes
737604 there have been some very strange happenings i have been
737605 yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out
737606 well well some concession might be made for your per
737607 then it must be nothing said i and there the matter was
737608 well maam i was comin in to ask if the visitors was stayin for lunch when this man jumped out at me
737609 i have been listening to her for the last five minutes but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative just a little wheezy susan are you not you breathe too heavily for that kind of work
737610 who be you anyhow and what right have you a pullin me about like this
737611 it was merely that i wished to ask a question in your presence did you mrs maberley mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me
737612 exactly now susan to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me
737613 now susan wheezy people may not live long you know its a wicked thing to tell fibs whom did you tell
737614 i believe you are a bad treach erous woman i remember now that i saw you speaking to someone over the hedge
737615 suppose i tell you that it was barney stockdale to whom you spoke
737616 well if you know what do you want to ask for
737617 i was not sure but i know now well now susan it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of barney
737618 someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world
737619 so a rich man no you smiled a rich woman now we have got so far you may as well give the name and earn the tenner
737620 i am clearing out of here ive had enough of you all ill send for my box to morrow
737621 this gang means business look how close they play the game your letter to me had the 10 p m postmark and yet susan passes the word to barney barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions he or she i incline to the latter from susans grin when she thought i had blundered forms a plan black steve is called in and i am warned off by eleven oclock next morning thats quick work you know
737622 yes thats the question who had the house before you
737623 i was wondering whether he could have buried something of course when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the post office bank but there are always some lunatics about it would be a dull world without them at first i thought of some buried valuable but why in that case should they want your furniture you dont happen to have a raphael or a first folio shakespeare without knowing it
737624 no i dont think i have anything rarer than a crown derby tea set
737625 that would hardly justify all this mystery besides why should they not openly state what they want if they covet your tea set they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out lock stock and barrel no as i read it there is something which you do not know that you have and which you would not give up if you did know
737626 let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point you have been in this house a year
737627 all the better during this long period no one wants anything from you now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands what would you gather from that
737628 that the object whatever it may be has only just come into the house
737629 indeed that is very remarkable well i think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data is that lawyer of yours a capable man
737630 have you another maid or was the fair susan who has just banged your front door alone
737631 try and get sutro to spend a night or two in the house you might possibly want protection
737632 who knows the matter is certainly obscure if i cant find what they are after i must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal did this house agent man give any address
737633 simply his card and occupation haines johnson auctioneer and valuer
737634 i dont think we shall find him in the directory honest business men dont conceal their place of business well you will let me know any fresh development i have taken up your case and you may rely upon it that i shall see it through
737635 you have not unpacked them how long have you had them
737636 but you said why surely this might be the missing link how do we know that there is not something of value there
737637 there could not possibly be mr holmes poor douglas had only his pay and a small annuity what could he have of value
737638 have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom examine them as soon as possible and see what they cohtain i will come to morrow and hear your report
737639 it wont be funny for you steve if i get after you i gave you fair warning this morning
737640 well masser holmes i done gone think over what you said and i dont want no more talk about that affair of masser perkins spose i can help you masser holmes i will
737641 well then tell me who is behind you on this job
737642 so help me the lord masser holmes i told you the truth before i dont know my boss barney gives me orders and thats all
737643 well just bear in mind steve that the lady in that house and everything under that roof is under my protection dont forget it
737644 ive got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin wat son
737645 i think he would double cross his employer if he knew who he was it was lucky i had some knowledge of the spencer john crowd and that steve was one of them now watson this is a case for langdale pike and i am going to see him now when i get back i may be clearer in the matter
737646 the drama has come to a crisis and quicker than i had expected there is a great driving power at the back of this business watson which does not surprise me after what i have heard this sutro of course is her lawyer i made a mistake i fear in not asking you to spend the night on guard this fellow has clearly proved a broken reed well there is nothing for it but another journey to harrow weald
737647 well mr holmes no chance for you in this case im afraid just a common ordinary burglary and well within the capacity of the poor old police no experts need apply
737648 i am sure the case is in very good hands
737649 quite so we know pretty well who the men are and where to find them it is that gang of barney stockdale with the big nigger in it theyve been seen about here
737650 well they dont seem to have got much mrs maberley was chloroformed and the house was ah here is the lady herself
737651 alas i did not take it i did not wish to trouble mr sutro and so i was unprotected
737652 mr holmes advised me to have some friend in the house i neglected his advice and i have paid for it
737653 perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred
737654 there is really so little to tell i have no doubt that wicked susan had planned an entrance for them they must have known the house to an inch i was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth but i have no notion how long i may have been senseless when i woke one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my sons baggage which was partially opened and littered over the floor before he could get away i sprang up and seized him
737655 i clung to him but he shook me off and the other may have struck me for i can remember no more mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window that brought the police but the rascals had got away
737656 well i dont think there is anything of value missing i am sure there was nothing in my sons trunks
737657 there was one sheet of paper which i may have torn from the man that i grasped it was lying all crumpled on the floor it is in my sons handwriting
737658 what rugged common sense none the less i should be curious to see it
737659 that is my advice to you mr holmes in twenty five years experience i have learned my lesson there is always the chance of finger marks or something
737660 seems to be the end of some queer novel so far as i can see
737661 it may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale
737662 you have noticed the number on the top of the page it is two hundred and forty five where are the odd two hundred and forty four pages
737663 well i suppose the burglars got those much good may it do them
737664 it seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that does it suggest anything to you inspector
737665 yes sir it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand i wish them joy of what they got
737666 well they found nothing valuable downstairs so they tried their luck upstairs that is how i read it what do you make of it mr holmes
737667 i must think it over inspector come to the window wat son
737668 face bled considerably from the cuts and blows but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life looking out at his agony and humilia tion she smiled yes by heaven she smiled like the heartless fiend she was as he looked up at her it was at that moment that love died and hate was born man must live for something if it is not for your embrace my lady then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge
737669 did you notice how the he suddenly changed to my the writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero
737670 i dont think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands by the way mrs maberley did you say you wished to travel
737671 where would you like to go cairo madeira the riviera
737672 oh if i had the money i would go round the world
737673 quite so round the world well good morning i may drop you a line in the evening
737674 now watson we are at the last lap of our little journey
737675 i think we had best clear the matter up at once and it would be well that you should come with me for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as isadora klein
737676 by the way watson i suppose you see it all clearly
737677 no i cant say that i do i only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief
737678 exactly but does the name isadora klein convey nothing to you she was of course the celebrated beauty there was never a woman to touch her she is pure spanish the real blood of the masterfui conquistadors and her people have been leaders in pernambuco for generations she married the aged german sugar king klein and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes she had several lovers and douglas maberley one of the most striking men in london was one of them it was by all accounts more than an adventure with him he was not a society butterfly but a strong proud man who gave and expected all but she is the belle dame sans merci of fiction when her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended and if the other party in the matter cant take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him
737679 ah you are piecing it together now i hear that she is about to marry the young duke of lomond who might almost be her son his graces ma might overlook the age but a big scandal would be a different matter so it is imperative ah here we are
737680 that means that we shall not have to wait kindly give this note to your mistress
737681 i simply wrote shall it be the police then i think that should pass us in
737682 i need not explain madame i have too much respect for your intelligence to do so though i confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late
737683 by supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him it was you then who forced me to examine the case of young maberley
737684 i have no idea what you are talking about what have i to do with hired bullies
737685 yes i have underrated your intelligence well good after noon
737686 come and sit down gentlemen let us talk this matter over i feel that i may be frank with you mr holmes you have the feelings of a gentleman how quick a womans instinct is to find it out i will treat you as a friend
737687 i cannot promise to reciprocate madame i am not the law but i represent justice so far as my feeble powers go i am ready to listen and then i will tell you how i will act
737688 no doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself
737689 what was really foolish madame is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away
737690 no no i am not so simple since i have promised to be
737691 such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them they will be arrested for this burglary the police are already after them
737692 they will take what comes to them that is what they are paid for i shall not appear in the matter
737693 no no you would not you are a gentleman it is a wom ans secret
737694 in the first place you must give back this manuscript
737695 you are very prompt in your actions madame but you have overdone it on this occasion
737696 but you must look at it with my eyes mr holmes you must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her lifes ambition about to be ruined at the last moment is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself
737697 yes yes i admit it he was a dear boy douglas but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans he wanted marriage marriage mr holmes with a penniless commoner nothing less would serve him then he became pertinacious because i had given he seemed to think that i still must give and to him only it was intolerable at last i had to make him realize it
737698 by hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window
737699 you do indeed seem to know everything well it is true barney and the boys drove him away and were i admit a little rough in doing so but what did he do then could i have believed that a gentleman would do such an act he wrote a book in which he described his own story i of course was the wolf he the lamb it was all there under different names of course but who in all london would have failed to recognize it what do you say to that mr holmes
737700 it was as if the air of italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel italian spirit he wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that i might have the torture of anticipation there were two copies he said one for me one for his publisher
737701 how did you know the publishers had not reached him
737702 i knew who his publisher was it is not his only novel you know i found out that he had not heard from italy then came douglass sudden death so long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me of course it must be among his effects and these would be returned to his mother i set the gang at work one of them got into the house as servant i wanted to do the thing honestly i really and truly did i was ready to buy the house and everything in it i offered any price she cared to ask i only tried the other way when everything else had failed now mr holmes granting that i was too hard on douglas and god knows i am sorry for it what else could i do with my whole future at stake
737703 i suppose i shall have to compound a felony as usual how much does it cost to go round the world in first class style
737704 very good i think you will sign me a check for that and i will see that it comes to mrs maberley you owe her a little change of air meantime lady
737705 have a care have a care you cant play with edged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands
737706 when a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an english sun could never give and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket it is not difficult to place him you wear a short beard which shows that you were not a regular you have the cut of a riding man as to middlesex your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from throgmorton street what other regiment would you join
737707 i see no more than you but i have trained myself to notice what i see however mr dodd it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning what has been happening at tuxbury old park
737708 my dear sir there is no mystery your letter came with that heading and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred
737709 yes indeed but the letter was written in the afternoon and
737710 well that was what it amounted to he is a hard nail is colonel emsworth the greatest martinet in the army in his day and it was a day of rough language too i couldnt have stuck the colonel if it had not been for godfreys sake
737711 i had got into the way of supposing that you knew every thing without being told
737712 when i joined up in january 1901 just two years ago
737713 well when the war was over and we all got back i wrote
737714 i wasnt satisfied mr holmes the whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural he was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that it was not like him then again i happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well the old man was sometimes a bully and young godfrey had too much spirit to stand it no i wasnt satisfied and i determined that i would get to the root of the matter it happened however that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out after two years ab sence and so it is only this week that i have been able to take up godfreys case again but since i have taken it up i mean to drop everything in order to see it through
737715 my first move was to get down to his home tuxbury old
737716 we had a bit of barney right away and i should have walked
737717 well sir said he in a rasping voice i should be inter
737718 i answered that i had explained them in my letter to his wife
737719 yes yes you said that you had known godfrey in africa
737720 he glanced at the two which i handed him and then he
737721 i was fond of your son godfrey sir many ties and memo
737722 i have some recollections sir that i had already corres
737723 my request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host
737724 many people mr dodd said he would take offence at
737725 you must put it down sir to my real love for your son
737726 so i came to a dead end mr holmes there was no getting
737727 i thought you might run short in the night time sir it is
737728 he hesitated before leaving the room and when i looked
737729 beg your pardon sir but i could not help hearing what
737730 there was no braver man in the regiment he pulled me
737731 yes sir yes that is master godfrey all over he was
737732 look here i cried you say he was you speak as if he
737733 i gripped the old man by the shoulder but he shrank away
737734 i dont know what you mean sir ask the master about
737735 he was leaving the room but i held his arm
737736 listen i said you are going to answer one question before you leave if i have to hold you all night is godfrey dead
737737 he could not face my eyes he was like a man hypnotized
737738 i wish to god he was he cried and tearing himself free
737739 you will think mr holmes that i returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind the old mans words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or at the least disreputable transaction which touched the family honour that stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light godfrey was a reckless fellow he was easily influenced by those around him no doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin it was a piteous business if it was indeed so but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if i could aid him i was anxiously pondering the matter when i looked up and there was godfrey emsworth standing before me
737740 he was outside the window mr holmes with his face
737741 but when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with
737742 it was a long path and the light was not very good but it
737743 there was nothing more i could do and i spent an uneasy
737744 the house was so large and so rambling that a regiment
737745 there were several small outhouses but at the end of the
737746 i explained that i was and that i was a friend of godfreys
737747 what a pity that he should be away on his travels for he
737748 quite so exactly said he with a rather guilty air no
737749 i had a good look at the little house as i passed it but the
737750 i have said that it was heavily curtained but now i found that the windows were shuttered as well some light however was breaking through one of them so i concentrated my attention upon this i was in luck for the curtain had not been quite closed and there was a crack in the shutter so that i could see the inside of the room it was a cheery place enough a bright lamp and a blazing fire opposite to me was seated the little man whom i had seen in the morning he was smoking a pipe and reading a paper
737751 possibly you observed whether it was a broad leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies
737752 now that you mention it it was not large it might have
737753 this way sir said he in a low voice he walked in silence
737754 there is a train to london at 8 30 said he the trap will
737755 he was white with rage and indeed i felt myself in so
737756 at this i lost my temper mr holmes and i spoke with
737757 i have seen your son and i am convinced that for some
737758 the old fellow looked diabolical and i really thought he was about to attack me i have said that he was a gaunt fierce old giant and though i am no weakling i might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him however after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room for my part i took the appointed train in the morning with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which i had already written
737759 to the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife they seemed to live in the simplest fashion
737760 none unless the little man with the beard acted as such he seemed however to be quite a superior person
737761 that seems very suggestive had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other
737762 now that you mention it i did see old ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house the idea of food did not occur to me at the moment
737763 yes i did i spoke to the station master and also to the innkeeper in the village i simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade godfrey emsworth both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world he had come home and then had almost at once started off again the story was evidently universally accepted
737764 that was very wise the matter should certainly be inquired into i will go back with you to tuxbury old park
737765 it is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary and on the other hand it may be essential it is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter
737766 you say that you saw your friends face quite clearly at the window so clearly that you are sure of his identity
737767 i have no doubt about it whatever his nose was pressed against the glass the lamplight shone full upon him
737768 only in colour his face was how shall i describe it it was of a fish belly whiteness it was bleached
737769 i think not it was his brow which i saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window
737770 i was too startled and horrified for the moment then i pursued him as i have told you but without result
737771 have i not told you you infernal busybody that you are warned off the premises never dare to show your damned face here again if you enter again without my leave i shall be within my rights if i use violence ill shoot you sir by god i will as to you sir
737772 i extend the same warning to you i am familiar with your ignoble profession but you must take your reputed talents to some other field there is no opening for them here
737773 until i hear from godfreys own lips that he is under no restraint
737774 telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables tell him there are burglars in the house
737775 you must be aware mr dodd that colonel emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house on the other hand he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son i venture to hope that if i were allowed to have five minutes conversation with colonel emsworth i could certainly alter his view of the matter
737776 ralph do what i have told you what the devil are you waiting for ring up the police
737777 any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread
737778 it is my business to know things that is my trade
737779 well if you wish to see godfrey you shall it is no doing of mine but you have forced my hand ralph tell mr godfrey and mr kent that in five minutes we shall be with them
737780 i cant help it mr kent our hands have been forced can mr godfrey see us
737781 dont touch me jimmie keep your distance yes you may well stare i dont quite look the smart lance corporal emsworth of b squadron do i
737782 i dont mind you jimmie but i could have done without your friend i suppose there is some good reason for it but you have me at a disadvantage
737783 i wanted to be sure that all was well with you godfrey i saw you that night when you looked into my window and i could not let the matter rest till i had cleared things up
737784 old ralph told me you were there and i couldnt help taking a peep at you i hoped you would not have seen me and i had to run to my burrow when i heard the window go up
737785 you remember that morning fight at buffelsspruit outside pretoria on the eastern railway line you heard i was hit
737786 three of us got separated from the others it was very broken
737787 when i came to myself it was nightfall and i raised myself
737788 it was morning when i wakened and it seemed to me that
737789 it seemed that none of them could speak english but the
737790 how in the world did you come here he asked in amaze
737791 need i tell you more jimmie it seems that in view of the
737792 so there you have my tragedy i hoped against hope but it was not until i had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that i had not escaped what was i to do i was in this lonely house we had two servants whom we could utterly trust there was a house where i could live under pledge of secrecy mr kent who is a surgeon was prepared to stay with me it seemed simple enough on those lines the alternative was a dreadful one segregation for life among strang ers with never a hope of release but absolute secrecy was necessary or even in this quiet countryside there would have been an outcry and i should have been dragged to my horrible doom even you jimmie even you had to be kept in the dark why my father has relented i cannot imagine
737793 it seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all
737794 who knows but good may come of it i understand that only mr kent has seen the patient may i ask sir if you are an authority on such complaints which are i understand tropical or semi tropical in their nature
737795 i have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man
737796 i have no doubt sir that you are fully competent but i am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable you have avoided this i understand for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient
737797 and i have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted i was able once to do him a professional service and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist his name is sir james saunders
737798 then i will ask sir james to step this way he is at present in the carriage outside the door meanwhile colonel emsworth we may perhaps assemble in your study where i could give the necessary explanations
737799 there remained the third possibility into which rare and unlikely as it was everything seemed to fit leprosy is not uncommon in south africa by some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it his people would be placed in a very dreadful position since they would desire to save him from segregation great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authori ties a devoted medical man if sufficiently paid would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer there would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease the case was a strong one so strong that i determined to act as if it were actually proved when on arriving here i noticed that ralph who carries out the meals had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants my last doubts were removed a single word showed you sir that your secret was discovered and if i wrote rather than said it it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted
737800 it is often my lot to bring ill tidings and seldom good
737801 this occasion is the more welcome it is not leprosy
737802 a well marked case of pseudo leprosy or ichthyosis a scale like affection of the skin unsightly obstinate but possibly curable and certainly noninfective yes mr holmes the coin cidence is a remarkable one but is it coincidence are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears at any rate i pledge my professional reputation but the lady has fainted i think that mr kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock
737803 what a morning mr holmes i thought i should see you out
737804 yes mcpherson started early and i expect i may find him there
737805 poor fellow poor fellow what can i do how can i help
737806 were you with him can you tell us what has happened
737807 no no i was late this morning i was not on the beach at all i have come straight from the gables what can i do
737808 you can hurry to the police station at fulworth report the matter at once
737809 id be glad of your advice mr holmes this is a big thing for me to handle and ill hear of it from lewes if i go wrong
737810 i could not bring them but there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair i see no reason however to connect it with that horrible happening save indeed that the lady had made an appointment with him
737811 but hardly at a bathing pool which all of you were in the habit of using
737812 he would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast poor chap he is dreadfully cut up about it all
737813 at one time they were not but for a year or more murdoch has been as near to mcpherson as he ever could be to anyone he is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature
737814 so i understand i seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill usage of a dog
737815 well then we must explore the matter of the girl do you know her
737816 everyone knows her she is the beauty of the neighbourhood a real beauty holmes who would draw attention everywhere i knew that mcpherson was attracted by her but i had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate
737817 she is the daughter of old tom bellamy who owns all the boats and bathing cots at fulworth he was a fisherman to start with but is now a man of some substance he and his son william run the business
737818 oh we can easily find a pretext after all this poor man did not ill use himself in this outrageous way some human hand was on the handle of that scourge if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries his circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive which in turn should lead us to the criminal
737819 thats the haven as bellamy called it the one with the corner tower and slate roof not bad for a man who started with nothing but by jove look at that
737820 i am your subordinate sir under your roof i am not aware that i owe you any account of my private actions
737821 in the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence mr murdoch
737822 your own question might perhaps come under the same heading
737823 this is not the first time that i have had to overlook your insubordinate ways it will certainly be the last you will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can
737824 i had intended to do so i have lost to day the only person who made the gables habitable
737825 no sir i do not desire any particulars my son here
737826 this other gentleman of yours let us know the news
737827 there is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter
737828 this is my business william kindly leave me to manage it in my own way by all accounts there has been a crime committed if i can help to show who did it it is the least i can do for him who is gone
737829 bring them to justice mr holmes you have my sympathy and my help whoever they may be
737830 i value a womans instinct in such matters you use the word they you think that more than one was concerned
737831 i knew mr mcpherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man no single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him
737832 i tell you maud not to mix yourself up in the matter
737833 the whole world will know the facts presently so there can be no harm if i discuss them here
737834 i should have preferred privacy but if your father will not allow it he must share the deliberations
737835 it is sure to be produced at the inquest may i ask you to throw any light upon it that you can
737836 we were engaged to be married and we only kept it secret because fitzroys uncle who is very old and said to be dying might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish there was no other reason
737837 so i would father if you had ever shown sympathy
737838 i object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station
737839 it was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you as to this appointment
737840 tuesday was to day and i had meant to meet him to night
737841 this never came by post how did you get it
737842 i would rather not answer that question it has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating but anything which bears upon that i will most freely answer
737843 may i ask if mr ian murdoch was one of them
737844 there was a time when i thought he was but that was all changed when he understood the relations between fitzroy and myself
737845 why sir everyone is talking of it it took on terrible and has eaten nothing for a week then to day two of the young gentlemen from the gables found it dead down on the beach sir at the very place where its master met his end
737846 yes it lay on the very edge of the pool
737847 it must have followed the trail of its dead master
737848 this is quite unofficial of course and need go no farther but i am fairly up against it in this mcpherson case the question is shall i make an arrest or shall i not
737849 yes sir there is really no one else when you come to think of it thats the advantage of this solitude we narrow it down to a very small compass if he did not do it then who did
737850 what would my position be if i let him slip away with all this evidence against him
737851 all the essential gaps in your case on the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi he had been with his scholars till the last moment and within a few minutes of mcphersons appearance he came upon us from behind then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could single handed have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself finally there is this question of the instru ment with which these injuries were inflicted
737852 what could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort
737853 but i have examined them very carefully with a lens they have peculiarities
737854 i should hardly be what i am if i did not now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder do you observe nothing remarkable
737855 surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity there is a dot of extravasated blood here and another there there are similar indications in this other weal down here what can that mean
737856 perhaps i have perhaps i havent i may be able to say more soon anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal
737857 but if a red hot net of wire had been laid across the back then these better marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other
737858 a most ingenious comparison or shall we say a very stiff cat o nine tails with small hard knots upon it
737859 by jove mr holmes i think you have hit it
737860 or there may be some very different cause mr bardle but
737861 yes i have considered that if the second word had borne
737862 perhaps i have but i do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss
737863 i wish i could see what was in your mind mr holmes perhaps its those fishing boats
737864 well then is it bellamy and that big son of his they were not too sweet upon mr mcpherson could they have done him a mischief
737865 no no you wont draw me until i am ready
737866 now inspector we each have our own work to do
737867 the man is at his last gasp it was all i could do to bring him here he fainted twice upon the way
737868 down on the beach exactly where poor mcpherson met his end if this mans heart had been weak as mcphersons was he would not be here now more than once i thought he was gone as i brought him up it was too far to the gables so i made for you
737869 i was walking on the cliff when i heard his cry he was at the edge of the water reeling about like a drunken man i ran down threw some clothes about him and brought him up for heavens sake holmes use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place for life is becoming unendurable can you with all your world wide reputation do nothing for us
737870 i think i can stackhurst come with me now and you inspector come along we will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands
737871 what was it mr holmes im born and bred in these parts but i never saw such a thing it dont belong to sussex
737872 it may have been the southwest gale that brought it up come back to my house both of you and i will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas
737873 if the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny
737874 he goes on to tell of his own encounter with one when
737875 the local pain was as he explains the least part of the
737876 pangs shot through the chest causing me to fall as if
737877 it nearly killed him although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing pool he says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards so white wrinkled and shrivelled was his face he gulped down brandy a whole bottleful and it seems to have saved his life there is the book inspector i leave it with you and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor mcpherson
737878 i do not blame you inspector nor you mr holmes for your suspicions were natural i feel that on the very eve of my arrest i have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend
737879 no mr murdoch i was already upon the track and had i been out as early as i intended i might well have saved you from this terrific experience
737880 i am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive mem ory for trifles that phrase the lions mane haunted my mind i knew that i had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context you have seen that it does describe the creature i have no doubt that it was floating on the water when mcpherson saw it and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death
737881 there are one or two words of explanation which i should give for i know the direction in which your inquiries have run it is true that i loved this lady but from the day when she chose my friend mcpherson my one desire was to help her to happiness i was well content to stand aside and act as their go between often i carried their messages and it was because i was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that i hastened to tell her of my friends death lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner she would not tell you sir of our relations lest you should disapprove and i might suffer but with your leave i must try to get back to the gables for my bed will be very welcome
737882 forgive what is past murdoch we shall understand each other better in the future
737883 i had read of you but i never believed it its wonderful
737884 i was slow at the outset culpably slow had the body been found in the water i could hardly have missed it it was the towel which misled me the poor fellow had never thought to dry himself and so i in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water why then should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me that was where i went astray well well inspector i often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force but cyanea capillata very nearly avenged scot land yard
737885 you mean the old fellow who has just gone out
737886 exactly watson pathetic and futile but is not all life pathetic and futile is not his story a microcosm of the whole we reach we grasp and what is left in our hands at the end a shadow or worse than a shadow misery
737887 well i suppose i may call him so he has been sent on by the yard just as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack they argue that they can do nothing more and that whatever happens the patient can be no worse than he is
737888 josiah amberley he says he was junior partner of brickfall and amberley who are manufacturers of artistic materials you will see their names upon paint boxes he made his little pile retired from business at the age of sixty one bought a house at lewisham and settled down to rest after a life of ceaseless grind one would think his future was tolerably assured
737889 retired in 1896 watson early in 1897 he married a woman twenty years younger than himself a good looking woman too if the photograph does not flatter a competence a wife leisure it seemed a straight road which lay before him and yet within two years he is as you have seen as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath the sun
737890 the old story watson a treacherous friend and a fickle wife it would appear that amberley has one hobby in life and it is chess not far from him at lewisham there lives a young doctor who is also a chess player i have noted his name as dr ray ernest ernest was frequently in the house and an intimacy between him and mrs amberley was a natural sequence for you must admit that our unfortunate client has few outward graces whatever his inner virtues may be the couple went off together last week destination untraced what is more the faithless spouse carried off the old mans deed box as her personal lug gage with a good part of his lifes savings within can we find the lady can we save the money a commonplace problem so far as it has developed and yet a vital one for josiah amberley
737891 well the immediate question my dear watson happens to be what will you do if you will be good enough to under study me you know that i am preoccupied with this case of the two coptic patriarchs which should come to a head to day i really have not time to go out to lewisham and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value the old fellow was quite insistent that i should go but i explained my difficulty he is prepared to meet a representative
737892 i confess i dont see that i can be of much service but i am willing to do my best
737893 the haven is the name of mr josiah amberleys house
737894 i think it would interest you holmes it is like some
737895 exactly i should not have known which was the haven had
737896 i had hardly entered the gateway before i saw mr amberley coming down the drive i only had a glimpse of him this morning and he certainly gave me the impression of a strange creature but when i saw him in full light his appearance was even more abnormal
737897 i have of course studied it and yet i should be interested to have your impression
737898 he seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care his back was curved as though he carried a heavy burden yet he was not the weakling that i had at first imagined for his shoulders and chest have the framework of a giant though his figure tapers away into a pair of spindled legs
737899 no you wouldnt i spotted his artificial limb but proceed
737900 i was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from under his old straw hat and his face with its fierce eager expression and the deeply lined features
737901 he began pouring out the story of his grievances we walked
737902 he took me into his dingy sanctum and we had a long chat
737903 i assured him that the financial question did not arise no
737904 that was the burden of his song for an hour or more he had it seems no suspicion of an intrigue they lived alone save for a woman who comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six on that particular evening old amberley wishing to give his wife a treat had taken two upper circle seats at the haymarket theatre at the last moment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go he had gone alone there seemed to be no doubt about the fact for he produced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife
737905 pray continue watson i find your narrative most arresting did you personally examine this ticket you did not perchance take the number
737906 it chanced to be my old school number thirty one and so is stuck in my head
737907 excellent watson his seat then was either thirty or thirty two
737908 that is most satisfactory what else did he tell you
737909 he showed me his strong room as he called it it really is a strong room like a bank with iron door and shutter burglar proof as he claimed however the woman seems to have had a duplicate key and between them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds worth of cash and securities
737910 he said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they would be unsaleable he had got back from the theatre about midnight and found the place plundered the door and window open and the fugitives gone there was no letter or message nor has he heard a word since he at once gave the alarm to the police
737911 well he was painting the passage but he had already painted the door and woodwork of this room i spoke of
737912 does it not strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances
737913 one must do something to ease an aching heart that was his own explanation it was eccentric no doubt but he is clearly an eccentric man he tore up one of his wifes photographs in my presence tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion i never wish to see her damned face again he shrieked
737914 yes one thing which struck me more than anything else i had driven to the blackheath station and had caught my train there when just as it was starting i saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own you know that i have a quick eye for faces holmes it was undoubtedly the tall dark man whom i had addressed in the street i saw him once more at london bridge and then i lost him in the crowd but i am convinced that he was following me
737915 a tall dark heavily moustached man you say with gray tinted sun glasses
737916 holmes you are a wizard i did not say so but he had gray tinted sun glasses
737917 quite simple my dear watson but let us get down to what is practical i must admit to you that the case which seemed to me to be so absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice is rapidly assuming a very different aspect it is true that though in your mission you have missed everything of importance yet even those things which have obtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought
737918 dont be hurt my dear fellow you know that i am quite impersonal no one else would have done better some possibly not so well but clearly you have missed some vital points what is the opinion of the neighbours about this man amberley and his wife that surely is of importance what of dr ernest was he the gay lothario one would expect with your natural advan tages watson every lady is your helper and accomplice what about the girl at the post office or the wife of the greengrocer i can picture you whispering soft nothings with the young lady at the blue anchor and receiving hard somethings in exchange all this you have left undone
737919 it has been done thanks to the telephone and the help of the yard i can usually get my essentials without leaving this room as a matter of fact my information confirms the mans story he has the local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband that he had a large sum of money in that strong room of his is certain so also is it that young dr ernest an unmarried man played chess with amberley and probably played the fool with his wife all this seems plain sailing and one would think that there was no more to be said and yet and yet
737920 in my imagination perhaps well leave it there watson let us escape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music carina sings to night at the albert hall and we still have time to dress dine and enjoy
737921 ive had a telegram mr holmes i can make nothing of it
737922 come at once without fail can give you information as
737923 little purlington is in essex i believe not far from frinton well of course you will start at once this is evidently from a responsible person the vicar of the place where is my crockford yes here we have him j c elman m a living of moosmoor cum little purlington look up the trains watson
737924 excellent you had best go with him watson he may need help or advice clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair
737925 what can this man possibly know of what has occurred it is waste of time and money
737926 he would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something wire at once that you are coming
737927 it would make the worst possible impression both on the police and upon myself mr amberley if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse to follow it up we should feel that you were not really in earnest in this investigation
737928 why of course i shall go if you look at it in that way
737929 on the face of it it seems absurd to suppose that this
737930 should he break away or return get to the nearest telephone exchange and send the single word bolted i will arrange here that it shall reach me wherever i am
737931 i mean the wire which you sent to mr josiah amberley about his wife and his money
737932 if this is a joke sir it is a very questionable one
737933 i have never heard of the gentleman you name and i have not sent a wire to anyone
737934 are there perhaps two vicarages here is the wire itself signed elman and dated from the vicarage
737935 there is only one vicarage sir and only one vicar and this wire is a scandalous forgery the origin of which shall certainly be investigated by the police meanwhile i can see no possible object in prolonging this interview
737936 most remarkable i much fear my dear watson that there is no return train to night i have unwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn however there is always nature watson nature and josiah amberley you can be in close commune with both
737937 if they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much use
737938 he has been interesting himself also in your business mr josiah amberley though we have been working independently but we both have the same question to ask you
737939 no short cuts josiah amberley things must be done de cently and in order what about it barker
737940 it is only a few hundred yards to the station we will go together you can stay here watson i shall be back within half an hour
737941 you had not met barker watson he is my hated rival upon the surrey shore when you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to complete the picture he has several good cases to his credit has he not inspector
737942 his methods are irregular no doubt like my own the irregulars are useful sometimes you know you for example with your compulsory warning about whatever he said being used against him could never have bluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession
737943 perhaps not but we get there all the same mr holmes dont imagine that we had not formed our own views of this case and that we would not have laid our hands on our man you will excuse us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use and so rob us of the credit
737944 there shall be no such robbery mackinnon i assure you that i efface myself from now onward and as to barker he has done nothing save what i told him
737945 that is very handsome of you mr holmes praise or blame can matter little to you but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin to ask questions
737946 quite so but they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow so it would be as well to have answers what will you say for example when the intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact points were which aroused your suspicion and finally gave you a certain conviction as to the real facts
737947 we dont seem to have got any real facts yet mr holmes you say that the prisoner in the presence of three witnesses practically confessed by trying to commit suicide that he had murdered his wife and her lover what other facts have you
737948 then you will soon get the clearest fact of all the bodies cannot be far away try the cellars and the garden it should not take long to dig up the likely places this house is older than the water pipes there must be a disused well somewhere try your luck there
737949 but how did you know of it and how was it done
737950 ill show you first how it was done and then i will give the explanation which is due to you and even more to my long suffering friend here who has been invaluable throughout but first i would give you an insight into this mans mentality it is a very unusual one so much so that i think his destination is more likely to be broadmoor than the scaffold he has to a high degree the sort of mind which one associates with the mediaeval italian nature rather than with the modern briton he was a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any adventurer such a one came upon the scene in the person of this chess playing doctor amberley excelled at chess one mark watson of a scheming mind like all misers he was a jealous man and his jealousy became a frantic mania rightly or wrongly he suspected an intrigue he determined to have his revenge and he planned it with diabolical cleverness come here
737951 you can thank dr watsons observation for that though he failed to draw the inference it set my foot upon the trail why should this man at such a time be filling his house with strong odours obviously to cover some other smell which he wisfhed to conceal some guilty smell which would suggest suspicions then came the idea of a room such as you see here with iron door and shutter a hermetically sealed room put those two facts together and whither do they lead i could only determine that by examining the house myself i was already certain that the case was serious for i had examined the box office chart at the haymarket theatre another of dr watsons and ascertained that nei ther b thirty nor thirty two of the upper circle had been occupied that night therefore amberley had not been to the theatre and his alibi fell to the ground he made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife the question now arose how i might be able to examine the house i sent an agent to the most impossible village i could think of and summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back to prevent any miscarriage dr watson accompanied him the good vicars name i took of course out of my crockford do i make it all clear to you
737952 there being no fear of interruption i proceeded to burgle the house burglary has always been an alternative profession had i cared to adopt it and i have little doubt that i should have come to the front observe what i found you see the gas pipe along the skirting here very good it rises in the angle of the wall and there is a tap here in the corner the pipe runs out into the strong room as you can see and ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling where it is concealed by the ornamentation that end is wide open at any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas with door and shutter closed and the tap full on i would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little chamber by what devilish device he decoyed them there i do not know but once inside the door they were at his mercy
737953 but of course the window and door were open then and the paint or some of it was already about he had begun the work of painting the day before according to his story but what next mr holmes
737954 well then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself i was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when i felt a hand inside my collar and a voice said now you rascal what are you doing in there when i could twist my head round i looked into the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival mr barker it was a curious foregathering and set us both smiling it seems that he had been engaged by dr ray ernests family to make some investigations and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play he had watched the house for some days and had spotted dr watson as one of the obvi ously suspicious characters who had called there he could hardly arrest watson but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry window there came a limit to his restraint of course i told him how matters stood and we continued the case together
737955 because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so admirably i fear you would not have gone so far
737956 well maybe not i understand that i have your word mr holmes that you step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results over to us
737957 well in the name of the force i thank you it seems a clear case as you put it and there cant be much difficulty over the bodies
737958 and i am sure amberley himself never observed it youll get results inspector by always putting yourself in the other fel lows place and thinking what you would do yourself it takes some imagination but it pays now we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room had not two minutes to live but wanted to get even with the fiend who was probably mocking at you from the other side of the door what would you do
737959 exactly you would like to tell people how you died no use
737960 well its only a foot above the ground the poor devil was on the floor dying when he wrote it he lost his senses before he could finish
737961 thats how i read it if you find an indelible pencil on the
737962 well look out for it you may be sure but those securities clearly there was no robbery at all and yet he did possess those bonds we verified that
737963 you may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place when the whole elopement had passed into history he would suddenly discover them and announce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder or had dropped it on the way
737964 of course he was bound to call us in but why he should have gone to you i cant understand
737965 you can file it in our archives watson some day the true story may be told
737966 mrs merrilow does not object to tobacco watson if you wish to indulge your filthy habits mrs merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful
737967 you will understand mrs merrilow that if i come to mrs ronder i should prefer to have a witness you will make her understand that before we arrive
737968 she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels
737969 then we shall come early in the afternoon let us see that we have our facts correct before we start if we go over them it will help dr watson to understand the situation you say that mrs ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face
737970 well mr holmes you would hardly say it was a face at all
737971 no sir but she gave hard cash and plenty of it a quarters rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms in these times a poor woman like me cant afford to turn down a chance like that
737972 mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most then again i only take the one and i have no family of my own i reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best its privacy she is after and she is ready to pay for it
737973 you say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion well it is a very remark able story most remarkable and i dont wonder that you want it examined
737974 i dont mr holmes i am quite satisfied so long as i get my rent you could not have a quieter lodger or one who gives less trouble
737975 her health mr holmes she seems to be wasting away
737976 very good mrs merrilow i should like to have a little chat with dr watson that will carry us till lunch time about three oclock you may expect to see us at your house in brixton
737977 the case worried me at the time watson here are my marginal notes to prove it i confess that i could make nothing of it and yet i was convinced that the coroner was wrong have you no recollection of the abbas parva tragedy
737978 and yet you were with me then but certainly my own impression was very superficial for there was nothing to go by and none of the parties had engaged my services perhaps you would care to read the papers
737979 that is very easily done it will probably come back to your
737980 they had among their exhibits a very fine north african
737981 it was usual for either ronder or his wife to feed the lion at
737982 it seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman the different grooms and employees rushed from their tents carrying lanterns and by their light an awful sight was revealed ronder lay with the back of his head crushed in and deep claw marks across his scalp some ten yards from the cage which was open close to the door of the cage lay mrs ronder upon her back with the creature squatting and snarling above her it had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought that she could live several of thc circus men headed by leonardo the strong man and griggs the clown drove the creature off with poles upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked in how it had got loose was a mystery it was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them there was no other point of interest in the evidence save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept screaming coward coward as she was carried back to the van in which they lived it was six months before she was fit to give evidence but the inquest was duly held with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure
737983 you may well say so and yet there were one or two points which worried young edmunds of the berkshire constabulary a smart lad that he was sent later to allahabad that was how i came into the matter for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it
737984 exactly i was sure you would pick up the trail presently
737985 well we were both worried it was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair look at it from the lions point of view he is liberated what does he do he takes half a dozen bounds forward which brings him to ronder ronder turns to fly the claw marks were on the back of his head but the lion strikes him down then instead of bounding on and escaping he returns to the woman who was close to the cage and he knocks her over and chews her face up then again those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her what could the poor devil have done to help her you see the difficulty
737986 and then there was another thing it comes back to me now as i think it over there was some evidence that just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed a man began shouting in terror
737987 well if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again there were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman
737988 i should think the whole camp was crying out by then as to the other points i think i could suggest a solution
737989 the two were together ten yards from the cage when the
737990 if they were both ten paces from the cage how came the beast to get loose
737991 is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it
737992 and why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them and doing tricks with them inside the cage
737993 possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it
737994 well watson there is this to be said for your theory ronder was a man of many enemies edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible a huge bully of a man he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way i expect those cries about a monster of which our visitor has spoken were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed however our speculations are futile until we have all the facts there is a cold partridge on the sideboard watson and a bottle of montrachet let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon them
737995 that is so madam though i do not know how you are aware that i was interested in your case
737996 l learned it when i had recovered my health and was exam ined by mr edmunds the county detective i fear i lied to him perhaps it would have been wiser had i told the truth
737997 it is usually wiser to tell the truth but why did you lie to him
737998 because the fate of someone else depended upon it i know that he was a very worthless being and yet i would not have his destruction upon my conscience we had been so close so close
737999 yes sir the person that i allude to is dead
738000 then why should you not now tell the police anything you know
738001 because there is another person to be considered that other person is myself i could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from a police examination i have not long to live but i wish to die undisturbed and yet i wanted to find one man of judgment to whom i could tell my terrible story so that when i am gone all might be understood
738002 you compliment me madam at the same time i am a responsible person i do not promise you that when you have spoken i may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police
738003 i think not mr holmes i know your character and methods too well for i have followed your work for some years reading is the only pleasure which fate has left me and i miss little which passes in the world but in any case i will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy it will ease my mind to tell it
738004 my friend and i would be glad to hear it
738005 then leonardo came more and more into my life you see
738006 leonardo had a clever scheming brain it was he who
738007 it was a pitch dark night when my husband and i went
738008 and then the terrible thing happened you may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood and how it excites them some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human being had been slain as i slipped the bars it bounded out and was on me in an instant leonardo could have saved me if he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it but the man lost his nerve i heard him shout in his terror and then i saw him turn and fly at the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face its hot filthy breath had already poisoned me and i was hardly conscious of pain with the palms of my hands i tried to push the great steaming blood stained jaws away from me and i screamed for help i was conscious that the camp was stirring and then dimly i remembered a group of men leonardo griggs and others dragging me from under the creatures paws that was my last memory mr holmes for many a weary month when i came to myself and saw myself in the mirror i cursed that lion oh how i cursed him not because he had torn away my beauty but because he had not torn away my life i had but one desire mr holmes and i had enough money to gratify it it was that i should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none and that i should dwell where none whom i had ever known should find me that was all that was left to me to do and that is what i have done a poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die that is the end of eugenia ronder
738009 poor girl the ways of fate are indeed hard to understand if there is not some compensation hereafter then the world is a cruel jest but what of this man leonardo
738010 i never saw him or heard from him again perhaps i have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him he might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left but a womans love is not so easily set aside he had left me under the beasts claws he had deserted me in my need and yet i could not bring myself to give him to the gallows for myself i cared nothing what became of me what could be more dreadful than my actual life but i stood between leonardo and his fate
738011 he was drowned last month when bathing near margate i saw his death in the paper
738012 and what did he do with this five clawed club which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story
738013 i cannot tell mr holmes there is a chalk pit by the camp
738014 well well it is of little consequence now the case is closed
738015 how can you tell the example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world
738016 exactly it came by post i send you my temptation i will follow your advice that was the message i think watson we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it
738017 unquestionably it is glue have a look at these scattered objects in the field
738018 those hairs are threads from a tweed coat the irregular gray masses are dust there are epithelial scales on the left those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue
738019 i am prepared to take your word for it does anything depend upon it
738020 in the st pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman the accused man denies that it is his but he is a picture frame maker who habitually handles glue
738021 no my friend merivale of the yard asked me to look into the case since i ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope
738022 i had a new client calling but he is overdue by the way watson you know something of racing
738023 i ought to i pay for it with about half my wound pension
738024 then ill make you my handy guide to the turf what about sir robert norberton does the name recall anything
738025 well i should say so he lives at shoscombe old place and i know it well for my summer quarters were down there once norberton nearly came within your province once
738026 it was when he horsewhipped sam brewer the well known curzon street money lender on newmarket heath he nearly killed the man
738027 ah he sounds interesting does he often indulge in that way
738028 well he has the name of being a dangerous man he is about the most daredevil rider in england second in the grand national a few years back he is one of those men who have overshot their true generation he should have been a buck in the days of the regency a boxer an athlete a plunger on the turf a lover of fair ladies and by all account so far down queer street that he may never find his way back again
738029 capital watson a thumb nail sketch i seem to know the man now can you give me some idea of shoscombe old place
738030 only that it is in the centre of shoscombe park and that the famous shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there
738031 is john mason you need not look surprised at my knowledge watson for this is a letter from him which i am unfolding but let us have some more about shoscombe i seem to have struck a rich vein
738032 you hear of them at every dog show the most exclusive breed in england they are the special pride of the lady of shoscombe old place
738033 sir robert has never married just as well i think consider ing his prospects he lives with his widowed sister lady beatrice falder
738034 no no the place belonged to her late husband sir james norberton has no claim on it at all it is only a life interest and reverts to her husbands brother meantime she draws the rents every year
738035 that is about the size of it he is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life yet i have heard that she is devoted to him but what is amiss at shoscombe
738036 ah that is just what i want to know and here i expect is the man who can tell us
738037 it was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper and too complicated it was only face to face i could do it
738038 first of all mr holmes i think that my employer sir robert has gone mad
738039 well sir when a man does one queer thing or two queer things there may be a meaning to it but when everything he does is queer then you begin to wonder i believe shoscombe prince and the derby have turned his brain
738040 the best in england mr holmes i should know if anyone does now ill be plain with you for i know you are gentlemen of honour and that it wont go beyond the room sir robert has got to win this derby hes up to the neck and its his last chance everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse and at fine odds too you can get forties now but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him
738041 but how is that if the horse is so good
738042 the public dont know how good he is sir robert has been
738043 it seems a rather desperate gamble but where does the madness come in
738044 well first of all you have only to look at him i dont believe he sleeps at night he is down at the stables at all hours his eyes are wild it has all been too much for his nerves then there is his conduct to lady beatrice
738045 they have always been the best of friends they had the same tastes the two of them and she loved the horses as much as he did every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them and above all she loved the prince he would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar but thats all over now
738046 well she seems to have lost all interest in the horses for a
738047 and a bitter savage spitelful quarrel at that why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child he gave it a few days ago to old barnes what keeps the green dragon three miles off at crendall
738048 of course with her weak heart and dropsy one couldnt expect that she could get about with him but he spent two hours every evening in her room he might well do what he could for she has been a rare good friend to him but thats all over too he never goes near her and she takes it to heart she is brooding and sulky and drinking mr holmes drinking like a fish
738049 well she took her glass but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening so stephens the butler told me its all changed mr holmes and there is something damned rotten about it but then again what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night and who is the man that meets him there
738050 go on mr mason you get more and more interesting
738051 it was the butler who saw him go twelve oclock at night and raining hard so next night i was up at the house and sure enough master was off again stephens and i went after him but it was jumpy work for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us hes a terrible man with his fists if he gets started and no respecter of persons so we were shy of getting too near but we marked him down all light it was the haunted crypt that he was making for and there was a man waiting for him there
738052 well sir there is an old ruined chapel in the park it is so old that nobody could fix its date and under it theres a crypt which has a bad name among us its a dark damp lonely place by day but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night but masters not afraid he never feared anything in his life but what is he doing there in the night time
738053 you say there is another man there it must be one of your own stablemen or someone from the house surely you have only to spot who it is and question him
738054 because i have seen him mr holmes it was on that second night sir robert turned and passed us me and stephens quak ing in the bushes like two bunny rabbits for there was a bit of moon that night but we could hear the other moving about behind we were not afraid of him so we up when sir robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please hullo mate who may you be says i i guess he had not heard us coming so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell he let out a yell and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness he could run ill give him that in a minute he was out of sight and hearing and who he was or what he was we never found
738055 yes i would swear to his yellow face a mean dog i should say what could he have in common with sir robert
738056 there is her maid carrie evans she has been with her this five years
738057 i quite understand mr mason of course the situation is clear enough from dr watsons description of sir robert i can realize that no woman is safe from him dont you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there
738058 well the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time
738059 but she may not have seen it before let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out she wants to get rid of the woman her brother will not permit it the invalid with her weak heart and inability to get about has no means of enforcing her will the hated maid is still tied to her the lady refuses to speak sulks takes to drink sir robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her does not all this hang together
738060 exactly as far as it goes how would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt we cant fit that into our plot
738061 no sir and there is something more that i cant fit in why should sir robert want to dig up a dead body
738062 we only found it out yesterday after i had written to you yesterday sir robert had gone to london so stephens and i went down to the crypt it was all in order sir except that in one corner was a bit of a human body
738063 well sir i think it would hardly interest them it was just the head and a few bones of a mummy it may have been a thousand years old but it wasnt there before that ill swear and so will stephens it had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board but that corner had always been empty before
738064 that was wise you say sir robert was away yesterday has he returned
738065 it was just a week ago to day the creature was howling outside the old wellhouse and sir robert was in one of his tantrums that morning he caught it up and i thought he would have killed it then he gave it to sandy bain the jockey and told him to take the dog to old barnes at the green dragon for he never wished to see it again
738066 i am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter mr mason
738067 there is a central heating furnace in the cellar under lady beatrices room its been off for some time but sir robert complained of cold and had it on again harvey runs it hes one of my lads this very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders he didnt like the look of it
738068 he makes it up every evening and then leaves it
738069 there is one door from outside there is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which lady beatrices room is situated
738070 these are deep waters mr mason deep and rather dirty you say that sir robert was not at home last night
738071 what is the name of that inn you spoke of
738072 well sir ive heard there are trout in the mill stream and pike in the hall lake
738073 thats good enough watson and i are famous fishermen are we not watson you may address us in future at the green dragon we should reach it to night i need not say that we dont want to see you mr mason but a note will reach us and no doubt i could find you if i want you when we have gone a little farther into the matter i will let you have a considered opinion
738074 what about the hall lake and the chance of a pike
738075 that wouldnt do sir you might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through
738076 its sir robert sir hes terrible jealous of touts if you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that hed be after you as sure as fate he aint taking no chances sir robert aint
738077 ive heard he has a horse entered for the derby
738078 yes and a good colt too he carries all our money for the race and all sir roberts into the bargain by the way
738079 no indeed just two weary londoners who badly need some good berkshire air
738080 well you are in the right place for that there is a deal of it lying about but mind what i have told you about sir robert hes the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards keep clear of the park
738081 surely mr barnes we certainly shall by the way that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall
738082 i should say it was that was the real shoscombe breed there aint a better in england
738083 now if it is a fair question what would a prize dog like that cost
738084 more than i could pay sir it was sir robert himself who gave me this one thats why i have to keep it on a lead it would be off to the hall in a jiffy if i gave it its head
738085 its not an easy one to play but we may see our way in a day or two by the way sir robert is still in london i hear we might perhaps enter the sacred domain to night without fear of bodily assault there are one or two points on which i should like reassurance
738086 only this watson that something happened a week or so
738087 let us consider our data the brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister he gives away her favourite dog her dog watson does that suggest nothing to you
738088 well it might be so or well there is an alternative now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel if there is a quarrel began the lady keeps her room alters her habits is not seen save when she drives out with her maid refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse and apparently takes to drink that covers the case does it not
738089 that is another line of thought there are two and i beg you will not tangle them line a which concerns lady beatrice has a vaguely sinister flavour has it not
738090 well now let us take up line b which concerns sir robert he is mad keen upon winning the derby he is in the hands of the jews and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors he is a daring and desperate man he derives his income from his sister his sisters maid is his willing tool so far we seem to be on fairly safe ground do we not
738091 ah yes the crypt let us suppose watson it is merely a scandalous supposition a hypothesis put forward for arguments sake that sir robert has done away with his sister
738092 very possibly watson sir robert is a man of an honourable stock but you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles let us for a moment argue upon this supposition he could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with shoscombe prince therefore he has still to stand his ground to do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim and he would also have to find a substitute who would imperson ate her with the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible the womans body might be conveyed to the crypt which is a place so seldom visited and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen what say you to that watson
738093 wel it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition
738094 i think that there is a small experiment which we may try to morrow watson in order to throw some light on the matter meanwhile if we mean to keep up our characters i suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace which seems to be the straight road to his affections we may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process
738095 about mid day mr barnes informs me the old lady takes a drive and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened when it comes through and before it gathers speed i want you watson to stop the coachman with some question never mind me i shall stand behind this holly bush and see what i can see
738096 he thought it was his mistress and he found it was a stranger dogs dont make mistakes
738097 exactly we have added one card to our hand watson but it needs careful playing all the same
738098 i got your note mr holmes sir robert has not returned yet but i hear that he is expected to night
738099 i cant afford to do that mr holmes the moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of shoscombe prince
738100 i see in that case we must work without you mr mason you can show us the crypt and then leave us
738101 you spoke of some bones mr mason could you show them before you go
738102 i fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part
738103 but why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years
738104 it may mean a long search and we need not detain you i fancy that we shall get our solution before morning
738105 i also have a question to ask you sir robert
738106 pos sibly it is familiar to you in any case my business is that of every other good citizen to uphold the law it seems to me that you have much to answer for
738107 appear ances are against me ill admit but i could act no otherwise
738108 i should be happy to think so but i fear your explanations must be before the police
738109 well if it must be it must come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands
738110 are mr and mrs norlett mrs norlett under her maiden name of evans has for some years been my sisters confidential maid i have brought them here because i feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what i say
738111 is this necessary sir robert have you thought what you are doing
738112 you have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or i should not have found you where i did therefore you know already in all probability that i am running a dark horse for the derby and that everything depends upon my success if i win all is easy if i lose well i dare not think of that
738113 i am dependent upon my sister lady beatrice for every thing but it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only for myself i am deeply in the hands of the jews i have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures everything would be seized my stables my horses everything well mr holmes my sister did die just a week ago
738114 what could i do absolute ruin faced me if i could stave things off for three weeks all would be well her maids husband this man here is an actor it came into our heads it came into my head that he could for that short period personate my sister it was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage for no one need enter her room save the maid it was not difficult to arrange my sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her
738115 her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end
738116 the body could not remain there on the first night norlett and i carried it out to the old well house which is now never used we were followed however by her pet spaniel which yapped continually at the door so i felt some safer place was needed i got rid of the spaniel and we carried the body to the crypt of the church there was no indignity or irreverence mr holmes i do not feel that i have wronged the dead
738117 perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position one cannot see all ones hopes and all ones plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them it seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husbands ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground we opened such a coffin removed the contents and placed her as you have seen her as to the old relics which we took out we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt norlett and i removed them and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace there is my story mr holmes though how you forced my hand so that i have to tell it is more than i can say
738118 your bets on the race and therefore your hopes for the future would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate
738119 the horse would be part of the estate what do they care for my bets as likely as not they would not run him at all my chief creditor is unhappily my most bitter enemy a rascally fellow sam brewer whom i was once compelled to horsewhip on newmarket heath do you suppose that he would try to save me
738120 this matter must of course be referred to the police it was my duty to bring the facts to light and there i must leave it as to the morality or decency of your conduct it is not for me to express an opinion it is nearly midnight watson and i think we may make our way back to our humble abode
738121 i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you
738122 indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
738123 i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
738124 this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out
738125 my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession
738126 the thing always appears to me to be so ridicu lously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours
738127 you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have fre quently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room
738128 quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experi ences you may be interested in this
738129 there will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight
738130 i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it
738131 the man who wrote it was presumably well to do
738132 such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff
738133 it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light
738134 the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather
738135 not at all the g with the small t stands for gesell schaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer
738136 eglow eglonitz here we are egria it is in a german speaking country in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that
738137 precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence this ac count of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to dis cover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts
738138 a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else
738139 not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it
738140 never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention
738141 this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address
738142 you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone
738143 you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me
738144 by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history
738145 the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own
738146 the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precau tion has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia
738147 i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it
738148 your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel felstein and hereditary king of bohemia
738149 you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you
738150 the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt farmiliar to you
738151 hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contralto hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw yes retired from operatic stage ha living in london quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back
738152 then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity
738153 oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed com mitted an indiscretion
738154 i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now
738155 five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result
738156 very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph
738157 to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the stnct principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
738158 threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none
738159 you are sure that she has not sent it yet
738160 because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday
738161 that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present
738162 certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm
738163 then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
738164 i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
738165 there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
738166 then good night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good night watson
738167 if you wlll be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you
738168 its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing
738169 i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler
738170 quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you
738171 i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to
738172 oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part
738173 this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keep ing if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation
738174 i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom
738175 he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch
738176 away they went and i was just wondering whether i should
738177 the church of st monica john she cried and half a
738178 this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balanc
738179 my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but
738180 come man come only three minutes or it wont be
738181 i was half dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appear ance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
738182 well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements
738183 i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation
738184 when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now
738185 i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her
738186 you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand
738187 to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window
738188 you are to watch me for i will be visible to you
738189 and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me
738190 it is an ordinary plumbers smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear
738191 i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the comer of the street
738192 that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play
738193 this marriage rather simplifies matters the pho tograph becomes a double edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph
738194 it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
738195 her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secre tive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardian ship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remem ber that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house
738196 she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is hcr carriage now carry out my orders to the letter
738197 but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital
738198 they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now
738199 he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm
738200 surely bring him into the sitting room there is a comfort able sofa this way please
738201 the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening
738202 then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick
738203 then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sitting room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
738204 it was all important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darling ton substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over precipitance may ruin all
738205 our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands
738206 at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay
738207 now i wonder who the deuce that could have been
738208 because it would spare your majesty all fear of future an noyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan
738209 it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made
738210 indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 5 15 train from char ing cross for the continent
738211 did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level
738212 from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty
738213 i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion
738214 nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire
738215 i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i
738216 your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes you have but to name it
738217 i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning
738218 you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson
738219 not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
738220 i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures
738221 your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
738222 you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combina tions we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination
738223 you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique
738224 beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else
738225 how in the name of good fortune did you know all that mr holmes
738226 how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter
738227 your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed
738228 i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc and compass breastpin
738229 what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk
738230 the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain the matter be comes even more simple
738231 i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all
738232 that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson
738233 here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir
738234 it is a little off the beaten track isnt it
738235 and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date
738236 it is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months ago
738237 well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes
738238 i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business
738239 his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head
738240 why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an em ployee who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement
738241 never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him
738242 yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple
738243 the first thing that put us out was that advertisement
738244 i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red headed
738245 why says he heres another vacancy on the league of
738246 why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i
738247 have you never heard of the league of the red headed
738248 why wonder at that for you are eligibile yourself for
738249 oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is
738250 well you can easily think that that made me prick up my
738251 but said i there would be millions of red headed men
738252 not so many as you might think he answered you see it
738253 now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves
738254 i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertise ment fleet street was choked with red headed folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were straw lemon orange brick irish setter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office
738255 there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden
738256 this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is
738257 and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he
738258 it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will
738259 my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself
738260 dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i
738261 my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i
738262 in the case of another said he the objection might be
738263 well it is a little awkward for i have a business already
738264 now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening
738265 that would suit me very well said i and the pay
738266 well you have to be in the office or at least in the
738267 its only four hours a day and i should not think of
738268 is to copy out the encyclopedia britannica there is the
738269 then good bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratu
738270 well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was
738271 well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as
738272 this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday
738273 eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end
738274 yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of card board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself
738275 if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere
738276 i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door
738277 i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i
738278 oh said he his name was william morris he was a
738279 oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17
738280 i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross
738281 i went home to saxe coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you
738282 your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear
738283 i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordi nary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some 30 pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them
738284 no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds
738285 we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you
738286 small stout built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
738287 have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings
738288 yes sir he told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad
738289 and has your business been attended to in your absence
738290 nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning
738291 that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to day is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion
738292 the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace feature less crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter
738293 it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes
738294 what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours
738295 i have nothing to do to day my practice is never very absorbing
738296 then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspec tive and i want to introspect come along
738297 i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand
738298 he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before
738299 mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red headed league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him
738300 my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxe coburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it
738301 i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowl edge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriage building depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums
738302 and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious
738303 a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to day being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help to night
738304 very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
738305 watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in adventure
738306 our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down
738307 i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
738308 he has his own little meth ods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force
738309 oh if you say so mr jones it is all right
738310 still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for seven and twenty years that i have not had my rubber
738311 that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some 30 000 pounds and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands
738312 john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet
738313 i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to night ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profes sion it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second
738314 this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us
738315 i must really ask you to be a little more quiet
738316 you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere
738317 for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
738318 we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
738319 yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30 000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2 000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
738320 and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern
738321 i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carree you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down
738322 that is back through the house into saxe coburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones
738323 l have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
738324 then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait
738325 have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it
738326 i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat tails
738327 there are three men waiting for him at the door
738328 oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very com pletely i must compliment you
738329 hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies
738330 i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands
738331 you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins
738332 well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station
738333 i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience
738334 i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay
738335 i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league
738336 it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertise ment of the league and the copying of the encyclopedia must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation
738337 had there been women in the house i should have suspected
738338 so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen
738339 and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night
738340 well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presence in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come to night
738341 it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true
738342 alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so
738343 well perhaps after all it is of some little use
738344 lhomme cest rien l oeuvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand
738345 the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic
738346 a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect
738347 this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace
738348 of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but here
738349 let us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
738350 indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argu ment
738351 this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example
738352 i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers
738353 it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems
738354 some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investi gation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime thc more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken
738355 oscillation upon the pavement al ways means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts
738356 that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting
738357 but now i know where the letters are without looking
738358 it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me
738359 i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel
738360 why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
738361 for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibank that is my father took it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you
738362 yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds
738363 oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive
738364 oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4 1 2 per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest
738365 and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds
738366 i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
738367 this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel
738368 they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel
738369 that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball
738370 oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remem ber and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way
738371 i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel
738372 yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met him that is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more
738373 well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet
738374 but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you
738375 well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the mean time and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know
738376 oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk
738377 thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know
738378 to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of
738379 it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most impor tant can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel
738380 he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare
738381 well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfa ther returned to france
738382 mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so l wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
738383 yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived
738384 ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church
738385 yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he couid not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him
738386 it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated
738387 oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a wedding morning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it
738388 most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
738389 yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened
738390 but you have no notion as to what it could have been
738391 one more question how did your mother take the matter
738392 she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again
738393 yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very indepen dent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me half mad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night
738394 and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life
738395 you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
738396 here is the slip and here are four letters from him
738397 mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business
738398 he travels for westhouse amp marbank the great claret im porters of fenchurch street
738399 thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life
738400 you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back
738401 i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive
738402 you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me
738403 not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves the sugges tiveness of thumb nails or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace now what did you gather from that womans appear ance describe it
738404 well she had a slate coloured broad brimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were grayish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar comfort able easy going way
738405 pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewing machine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broad est part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pince nez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to sur prise her
738406 but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots half buttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry
738407 i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel
738408 missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a
738409 they are very commonplace abso lutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you
738410 not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestive in fact we may call it conclusive
738411 my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case
738412 i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted
738413 no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock to morrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
738414 oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel
738415 who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland
738416 he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in
738417 i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock
738418 yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel
738419 i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel
738420 that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious
738421 we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn
738422 and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank
738423 i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well
738424 i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes
738425 if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it
738426 i let you know then that i have caught him
738427 there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over
738428 i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong
738429 the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money
738430 and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a consider able sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to pre serve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but alfectionate and warm hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself
738431 we never thought that she would have been so carried away
738432 very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treach ery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended jour neys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank
738433 it may be so or it may not mr holmes
738434 but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
738435 yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove
738436 that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest
738437 i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
738438 well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the step father then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewrit ing his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction
738439 having once spotted my man it was easy to get corrobora tion i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise the whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the type writer and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic de fects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse amp marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee james windibank voila tout
738440 if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world
738441 i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present
738442 oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmess cases
738443 i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them
738444 but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour
738445 it is reaily very good of you to come watson
738446 it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets
738447 not a word i have not seen a paper for some days
738448 the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
738449 but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
738450 well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for
738451 boscombe valley is a country district not very far from
738452 on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his
738453 from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quar
738454 the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the game keeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt end of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful mur der having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court
738455 if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here
738456 it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to some thing entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who be lieve in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with a study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
738457 that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case
738458 besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that
738459 my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterizes you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and infer ence therein lies my metier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering
738460 it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury
738461 no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
738462 coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
738463 it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty on
738464 so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged
738465 what is the young mans own account of the matter
738466 it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself
738467 i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3d my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodge keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assis tance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter
738468 do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help
738469 then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it
738470 that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrep ancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son
738471 both you and the coroner have been at some pains
738472 to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imaginition and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying refer ence to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
738473 i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
738474 how is the glass twenty nine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to night
738475 yau have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
738476 the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she hai heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door
738477 i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
738478 you may rely upon my doing all that i can
738479 but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent
738480 i am afraid that my col league has been a little quick in forming his conclusions
738481 but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it
738482 it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and and well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them
738483 no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it
738484 may i see your father if i call to morrow
738485 yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nlervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria
738486 quite so at the gold mines where as i understand mr turner made his money
738487 thank you miss turner you have been of material assis tance to me
738488 you will tell me if you have any news to morrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
738489 i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him good bye and god help you in your undertak ing
738490 why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not over tender of heart but i call it cruel
738491 i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy
738492 then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night
738493 then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
738494 it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy
738495 none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quick witted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
738496 if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner
738497 ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boarding school what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered
738498 ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow
738499 it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of
738500 about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free
738501 oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him every body about here speaks of his kindness to him
738502 really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that
738503 i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies
738504 you do find it very hard to tackle the facts
738505 anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of
738506 that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
738507 but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left
738508 i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some
738509 oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodge keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet
738510 these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come again of course that was for the cloak now where did they come from
738511 i fancy that this gray house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our lunchebn you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently
738512 the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon
738513 is a tall man left handed limps with the right leg wears thick soled shooting boots and a gray cloak smokes indian ci gars uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
738514 theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hard headed british jury
738515 you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this after noon and shall probably return to london by the evening train
738516 surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood
738517 and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard
738518 i have given you the chance here are your lodgings good bye i shall drop you a line before i leave
738519 just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound
738520 well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both in stantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
738521 well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia
738522 quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat
738523 it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a gray garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a gray cloak
738524 and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
738525 then comes our expedition of to day by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
738526 you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles
738527 his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces
738528 the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limped he was lame
738529 you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a left handed man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discov ered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam
738530 i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen knife
738531 yes the lodge keeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
738532 i thought people would talk if i went to the hall
738533 but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes
738534 i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested
738535 i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however
738536 i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a jail
738537 i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed
738538 you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil
738539 it was in the early 60s at the diggings i was a young chap
738540 one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to mel
738541 i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in
738542 here we are jack says he touching me on the arm
738543 well down they came to the west country there was no
738544 his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i
738545 when we went down there i found him talking with his son so smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentle men of all that occurred
738546 i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation
738547 i pray not sir and what do you intend to do
738548 in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
738549 your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine
738550 that was surely the bell who could come to night some friend of yours perhaps
738551 if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys
738552 i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
738553 they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the south west i see
738554 that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
738555 i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal
738556 ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
738557 i have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a woman
738558 but what is that compared with the number of your successes
738559 i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
738560 none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal
738561 and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
738562 pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
738563 you must know that my grandfather had two sons my
738564 my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young
738565 he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the
738566 one day it was in march 1883 a letter with a foreign
738567 death said he and rising from the table he retired to his
738568 they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still
738569 i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked
738570 i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i
738571 i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away
738572 well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little green scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some 14 000 pounds which lay to his credit at the bank
738573 your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever lis tened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide
738574 the letter arrived on march 10 1883 his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2d
738575 when my father took over the horsham property he at my
738576 well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to
738577 why what on earth does this mean john he stammered
738578 my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i
738579 he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are
738580 put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his
738581 the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but
738582 pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a
738583 some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to
738584 and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort
738585 no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such
738586 it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate
738587 on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
738588 in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask
738589 it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed way from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
738590 i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
738591 you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair
738592 but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
738593 they have however allowed me a policeman who may re main in the house with me
738594 and above all why did you not come at once
738595 i did not know it was only to day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
738596 it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which might help us
738597 that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles
738598 and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act
738599 there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand
738600 do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
738601 you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise
738602 do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself
738603 it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so l trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
738604 that is well to morrow i shall set to work upon your case
738605 no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it
738606 then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular
738607 that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this
738608 well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos
738609 formed any definite conception as to what these perils are
738610 then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family
738611 would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeav oured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion
738612 it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis
738613 i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to night we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong rea son for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters
738614 the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
738615 they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship
738616 excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probability the strong probability is that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfillment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything
738617 but the letter had also a greater distance to come
738618 there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship it looks as if they always seni their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
738619 more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
738620 the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society
738621 ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resem
738622 that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered
738623 is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and c that is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellowmen
738624 i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws
738625 it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquir ies i may have to go down to horsham after all
738626 no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
738627 my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading
738628 between nine and ten last night police constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the water police the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing places for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condi tion of the riverside landing stages
738629 it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death
738630 how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now
738631 no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before
738632 starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast
738633 not a bite i had no time to think of it
738634 i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them it is well thought of
738635 it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him
738636 the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first
738637 over lloyds regis ters and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and febru ary in 83 there were thirty six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union
738638 i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin
738639 i searched the dundee records and when i found that the bark lone star was there in january 85 my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
738640 the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savan nah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
738641 oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only native born americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
738642 it is kate whit ney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in
738643 i didnt know what to do so l came straight to you
738644 it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed
738645 oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so fright ened about him
738646 there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him
738647 good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednes day what dyou want to frighten the chap for
738648 i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself
738649 so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipes i forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten kate poor little kate give me your hand have you a cab
738650 then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself
738651 then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes
738652 that you imagine that i have added opium smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views
738653 yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognized in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trap door at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights
738654 ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here
738655 oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a double bedded one
738656 yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry
738657 near lee in kent we have a seven mile drive before us
738658 of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me to morrow about eleven give her her head so long then
738659 it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not over pleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to night when she meets me at the door
738660 i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
738661 some years ago to be definite in may 1884 there came
738662 last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of consider able value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me to night mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping pro ceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 4 35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far
738663 lf you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and
738664 and now as to the villains who seemed to be immedlately
738665 so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regula tions he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the left hand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat cross legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the har vest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers by this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
738666 what could he have done single handed against a man in the prime of life
738667 he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well nurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by excep tional strength in the others
738668 mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
738669 and it did though they hardly found upon the mud bank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets
738670 no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and half pennies 421 pennies and 270 half pennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
738671 but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone
738672 no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell tale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared
738673 well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a profes sional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the ques tions which have to be solved what neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance are all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
738674 we have touched on three english counties in our short drive start ing in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet
738675 but why are you not conducting the case from baker street
738676 because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa
738677 thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day
738678 this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation
738679 you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us
738680 i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy
738681 i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer
738682 do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion
738683 in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive
738684 then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to day
738685 i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address
738686 the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the grayish colour which shows that blotting paper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here
738687 and you are sure that this is your husbands hand
738688 his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well
738689 dearest do not be frightened all will come well there
738690 neville written in pencil upon the fly leaf of a book octavo size no water mark hum posted to day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam
738691 and they were posted to day at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over
738692 unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent
738693 no no it is it is his very own writing
738694 very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted to day
738695 oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the dining room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death
738696 i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analyti cal reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you
738697 and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you
738698 and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane
738699 but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands
738700 he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room
738701 no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs
738702 quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on
738703 but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat
738704 had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium
738705 thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day to morrow
738706 then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stable boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out
738707 i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now
738708 i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock
738709 i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all
738710 i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet
738711 i called about that beggarman boone the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee
738712 yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
738713 oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel
738714 yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it
738715 would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag
738716 i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
738717 now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respect able figure
738718 he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he
738719 to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent
738720 it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph
738721 with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it
738722 well i have been twenty seven years in the force but this really takes the cake
738723 if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained
738724 no crime but a very great error has been committed
738725 you would have done better to have trusted you wife
738726 god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do
738727 if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up
738728 of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reasoa that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all
738729 you are the first who have ever heard my story my father
738730 i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter
738731 well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to
738732 well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums
738733 as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the
738734 last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in
738735 i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear
738736 and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days
738737 i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging
738738 if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone
738739 i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
738740 in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very moch indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results
738741 by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast
738742 not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial one
738743 but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction
738744 that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
738745 only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such
738746 that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime
738747 precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire
738748 no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morn ing peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official looking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose
738749 my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
738750 he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner
738751 then what clue could you have as to his identity
738752 but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt
738753 here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article
738754 on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences
738755 then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat
738756 it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been
738757 and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him
738758 he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middle aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with lime cream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house
738759 not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained
738760 i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual
738761 a man with so large a brain must have something in it
738762 this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world
738763 well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression
738764 they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self respect
738765 the further points that he is middle aged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses lime cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hair ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of lime cream this dust you will observe is not the gritty gray dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training
738766 but his wife you said that she had ceased to love him
738767 this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection
738768 nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg
738769 you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house
738770 one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallow stains from a gasjet are you satisfied
738771 but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
738772 eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window
738773 see here sir see what my wife found in its crop
738774 this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got
738775 a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty
738776 its more than a precious stone it is the precious stone
738777 precisely so l ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjec tured but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
738778 that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would in duce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
738779 it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopoli tan
738780 precisely so on december 22d just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewel case the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe
738781 the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertain ing what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods
738782 give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then
738783 found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at 6 30 this evening at 221b baker street that is clear and concise
738784 well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertis ing agency and have this put in the evening papers
738785 oh in the clobe star pall mall st jamess evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you
738786 ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring
738787 just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southem china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriol throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty grain weight of crystallized charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it
738788 well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter
738789 it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
738790 in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
738791 very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop
738792 pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker
738793 because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise
738794 shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
738795 i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them
738796 very naturally by the way about the bird we were com pelled to eat it
738797 yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well
738798 of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of
738799 they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure
738800 but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permis sion i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard
738801 by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose
738802 there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museum we are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity
738803 it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson
738804 then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
738805 your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese
738806 yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club
738807 ah yes i see but you see sir thems not our geese
738808 well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden
738809 ah i dont know him well heres your good health
738810 remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his inno cence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march
738811 well there are some on the stall with the gas flare
738812 fine birds they were too now where did you get them from
738813 what are you driving at lets have it straight now
738814 it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha
738815 oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle
738816 warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them
738817 well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries
738818 if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred
738819 well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred
738820 dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred
738821 its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate
738822 i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book
738823 thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me
738824 here you are mrs oakshott 117 brixton road egg and poultry supplier
738825 when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet
738826 i daresay that if i had put loo pounds down in
738827 i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you
738828 no but one of them was mine all the same
738829 well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this
738830 ha this may save us a visit to brixton road
738831 come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow
738832 but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you
738833 you who are you how could you know anything of the matter
738834 my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know
738835 excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member
738836 oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet
738837 i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter
738838 in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind swept market place
738839 but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting
738840 precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
738841 the fire looks very seasonabe in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basket chair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese
738842 or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interested white with a black bar across the tail
738843 yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was dead the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum
738844 hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure
738845 i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars
738846 i see her ladyships waiting maid well the temptation of
738847 think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont
738848 it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing
738849 i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down
738850 hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety
738851 i will tell you it just as it happened sir
738852 i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad
738853 my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have
738854 whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she
738855 well said i you said youd give me one for christmas
738856 oh says she weve set yours aside for you jems bird
738857 thank you maggie says l but if it is all the same to
738858 the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we
738859 never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i
738860 oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it
738861 that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of
738862 oh very well kill it and take it with you
738863 well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird
738864 but was there another with a barred tail i asked the
738865 yes jem there were two barred tailed ones and i could
738866 well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves to night well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and now and now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me
738867 i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to jail now and you make him a jail bird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature
738868 but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
738869 no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
738870 my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
738871 my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
738872 we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see
738873 no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station
738874 the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver
738875 i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
738876 ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
738877 the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
738878 my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfa ther who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
738879 the family was at one time among the richest in england
738880 when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs
738881 but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this
738882 last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into
738883 you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
738884 she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but wlthin a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
738885 it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain
738886 the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that
738887 tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone
738888 i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in
738889 because during the last few nights i have always about
738890 no i have not it must be those wretched gypsies in the
738891 very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that
738892 well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
738893 was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
738894 i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
738895 i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splash ing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognized me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
738896 are you sure about this whis tle and metallic sound could you swear to it
738897 that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
738898 no she was in her night dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box
738899 showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclu sions did the coroner come to
738900 he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
738901 what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
738902 it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
738903 ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band
738904 sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gypsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
738905 two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
738906 miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather
738907 there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
738908 as it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
738909 then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself
738910 i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming
738911 and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast
738912 no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
738913 it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
738914 yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impass able then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
738915 what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
738916 when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the pres ence of a band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
738917 and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil
738918 my name sir but you have the advantage of me
738919 i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you
738920 it is a little cold for the time of the year
738921 i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler
738922 when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
738923 i will go when i have said my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here
738924 i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own
738925 fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investiga tion however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
738926 to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 pounds is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750 pounds each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth brush are i think all that we need
738927 yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott
738928 but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the foot path over the fields there it is where the lady is walking
738929 yes i think we had better do as you suggest
738930 that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word
738931 all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
738932 we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaint ance
738933 he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns
738934 he must guard himself for he may find that there is some one more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
738935 this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber
738936 exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one
738937 pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
738938 there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
738939 ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course
738940 yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through
738941 as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kind ness to go into your room and bar your shutters
738942 my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
738943 yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
738944 no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
738945 indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
738946 no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
738947 there are one or two very singular points about this room for exam ple what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
738948 yes there were severa little changes carried out about that time
738949 they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
738950 only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers
738951 no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon
738952 ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine
738953 its a common enough lash but i dont know why if should be tied
738954 that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
738955 that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
738956 the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance
738957 in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
738958 yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there
738959 you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
738960 we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investi gate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
738961 i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
738962 then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death
738963 i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
738964 you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
738965 no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
738966 i have really some scruples as to taking you to night there is a distinct element of danger
738967 you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
738968 no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did
738969 i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
738970 yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
738971 i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
738972 oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator
738973 well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you
738974 it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
738975 the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull
738976 i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
738977 subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to some thing more cheerful
738978 we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator
738979 do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
738980 and per haps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room
738981 the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
738982 i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfa ther hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occu pant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
738983 and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
738984 i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you
738985 i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor
738986 but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the side table
738987 you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation
738988 and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be
738989 this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably
738990 yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding sol tied one end of my handker chief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
738991 it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province
738992 capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through
738993 perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evi dently trying to your nerves
738994 oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evi dence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done
738995 if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police
738996 and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him
738997 ill do better ill take you round to him myself
738998 well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it
738999 yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story
739000 then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant
739001 it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley
739002 pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
739003 but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so l shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
739004 i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
739005 yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the
739006 i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at
739007 well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just
739008 that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me
739009 undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to
739010 if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely
739011 he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me
739012 very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like light
739013 thats all right said he coming back i know the clerks
739014 a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had
739015 i beg that you will state your business sir said l my
739016 how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he
739017 i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the
739018 the work appears to be light and the pay munificent
739019 precisely so we shall want you to come to night by the
739020 to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders
739021 i shall come down in a carriage to meet you
739022 yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good
739023 then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose
739024 that is very awkward could i not come at some more
739025 we have judged it best that you should come late it is to
739026 i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they
739027 quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
739028 then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that
739029 some little time ago i bought a small place a very small
739030 i quite follow you said i the only point which i could
739031 ah said he carelessly we have our own process we
739032 and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last
739033 well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was
739034 at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dim lit station aher eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the wood work and away we went as fast as the horse could go
739035 yes i saw it by the side lights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut
739036 thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray con tinue your most interesting statement
739037 away we went then and we drove for at least an hour
739038 it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled
739039 perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for
739040 i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my
739041 suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
739042 i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to
739043 but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for
739044 it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can
739045 but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more
739046 this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by
739047 on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because
739048 he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had
739049 no no this is only where we compress it but never mind
739050 we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp
739051 colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door
739052 we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press
739053 i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very
739054 i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
739055 the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness
739056 very well said he you shall know all about the ma
739057 and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent
739058 i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the
739059 i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist
739060 come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in
739061 this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to
739062 it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be
739063 as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of
739064 you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away
739065 i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up
739066 how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have
739067 half dazed i went into the station and asked about the
739068 it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise
739069 it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this
739070 lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twenty six a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy
739071 undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those out and out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford
739072 that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be some where near that line you said ten miles i think sir
739073 and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious
739074 they must have done so l have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
739075 is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties
739076 i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life
739077 well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found
739078 you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there
739079 because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any
739080 its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to
739081 six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
739082 of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang
739083 they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver
739084 we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work
739085 they have been turning out half crowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough
739086 i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
739087 is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose
739088 no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a bener lined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm
739089 there is the gravel drive and there are the rose bushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from
739090 you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oil lamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now
739091 it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty guinea fee and what have i gained
739092 indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
739093 your morning letters if i remember right were from a fish monger and a tide waiter
739094 and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social sum monses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie
739095 oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all
739096 i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not
739097 it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding
739098 that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from
739099 lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance
739100 it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger
739101 he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour
739102 then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is
739103 lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 1846 hes forty one years of age which is mature for marriage was under secretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secre tary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid
739104 i have very little difficulty in finding what i want
739105 for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
739106 oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up now though indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections
739107 here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal
739108 a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal u s a that is all
739109 there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
739110 there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present free trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the manage ment of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivi ties is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and com mon transition from a republican lady to a british peeress
739111 oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the mariage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days later that is on wednesday last there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the no tices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride
739112 indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact
739113 yes it struck me as being a little out of the common
739114 they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details
739115 such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a
739116 the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown
739117 the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duch ess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her pro longed absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascer taining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had tran spired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
739118 only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one
739119 that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the distur bance has actually been arrested it appears that she was for merly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands now so far as it has been set forth in the public press
739120 and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a wit ness if only as a check to my own memory
739121 pray take the basket chair this is my friend and col league dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over
739122 a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society
739123 that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours
739124 of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion
739125 thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correct this article for example as to the disappearance of the bride
739126 but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
739127 i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused
739128 he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope
739129 in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds
739130 now what is your own impression as to the young ladys your wifes character
739131 my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuous volcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in cartying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bear
739132 had not i thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic self sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
739133 the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance
739134 yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her
739135 a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family
739136 and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli
739137 very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding
739138 never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives
739139 indeed that is vety interesting and on the morning of the wedding
739140 she was as bright as possible at least until after the ceremony
739141 well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
739142 oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
739143 indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then
739144 oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open
739145 no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a common looking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point
739146 lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house
739147 alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her
739148 a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way
739149 oh a few minutes i had something else to think of
739150 lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant
739151 american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid
739152 no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back
739153 but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
739154 quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning
739155 ah yes i should like a few patticulars as to this young lady and your relations to her
739156 we have been on a friendly footing for some years i may say on a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hot headed and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she en deavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row
739157 and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
739158 yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
739159 l did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely
739160 still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place
739161 well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous distur bance in my wife
739162 well really when i consider that she has turned her back i will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without success i can hardly explain it in any other fashion
739163 and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast table so that you could see out of the window
739164 we could see the other side of the road and the park
739165 quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you
739166 i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine
739167 it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own
739168 i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross questioning i had formed my conclu sions as to the case before our client came into the room
739169 i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole exami nation served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstan tial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example
739170 without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco prussian war it is one of these cases but hello here is lestrade good afternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box
739171 and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business
739172 who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day
739173 because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
739174 well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up
739175 oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the maner
739176 then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it
739177 there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes
739178 no they were found floating near the margin by a park keeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
739179 by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this
739180 at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disap pearance
739181 i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blun ders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar
739182 in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a card case in the card case is a note and here is the very note
739183 you will see me when all is ready come at once
739184 f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach
739185 you really are very fine indeed let me see it
739186 the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here
739187 and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply
739188 oct 4th rooms 8s breakfast 2s 6d cocktail 1s lunch 2s 6d glass sherry 8d i see nothing in that
739189 very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again
739190 i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories good day mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first
739191 i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person
739192 there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work
739193 so l think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little
739194 you seem to expect company they have laid for five
739195 yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in
739196 i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs
739197 yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say
739198 when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
739199 it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any
739200 i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis
739201 you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position
739202 i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used
739203 yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful
739204 allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met
739205 oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar
739206 perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter
739207 weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it
739208 the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and
739209 still if i had married lord st simon of course id have
739210 when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to me seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
739211 it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived
739212 then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again just sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back so frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to morrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me
739213 but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
739214 then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go
739215 that you would have joined us in a friendly supper
739216 i think that there you ask a little too much
739217 i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent develop ments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good night
739218 then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company
739219 it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes
739220 because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard
739221 from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to ac quire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this ameri can be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young woman hood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confiden tial maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumping which in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband the chances being in favour of the latter
739222 it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held infor mation in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels
739223 by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an ameri can gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home l ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment
739224 perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings
739225 here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone
739226 he is looking up at the numbers of the houses
739227 yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognize the symptoms ha did i not tell you
739228 you have come to me to tell your story have you not
739229 you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me
739230 cod knows i have a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair
739231 and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you
739232 is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder amp stevenson of threadneedle street
739233 it is of course well known to you that in a successful
739234 yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank
739235 mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in
739236 the firm does so when the security is good i answered
739237 for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked
739238 next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall
739239 i should be happy to advance it without further parley from
739240 i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a
739241 one of the most precious public possessions of the em
739242 i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
739243 the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at
739244 you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong
739245 seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more
739246 when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to
739247 and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i
739248 so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it
739249 it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in
739250 and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir
739251 and now there is only she to be described she is my niece
739252 now mr holmes you know the people who live under my
739253 when we were taking coffee in the drawing room that night
739254 well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled
739255 oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a young
739256 he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of
739257 look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you
739258 no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too
739259 you have been very kind said he but i must have this
739260 yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured
739261 i was very angry for this was the third demand during the
739262 when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my
739263 tell me dad said she looking i thought a little dis
739264 she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt
739265 you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you
739266 then good night i kissed her and went up to my bed
739267 i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear
739268 i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to
739269 arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you
739270 the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy
739271 there are three missing and you know where they are
739272 you have called me names enough said he i will not
739273 you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried
739274 you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion
739275 by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my
739276 at least said he you will not have me arrested at once
739277 that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal
739278 you may as well face the matter said i you have been
739279 keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he an swered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravel ling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of looo pounds my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do
739280 none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think
739281 arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it
739282 she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is four and twenty
739283 this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also
739284 you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt
739285 how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
739286 i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
739287 do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it
739288 god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so
739289 precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep
739290 they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door
739291 a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems
739292 they are still sounding the planking and probing the furni ture in the hope of finding them
739293 yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole gar den has already been minutely examined
739294 is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing room opened your bureau took out your coronet broke otf by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirty nine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable
739295 if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them
739296 so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
739297 you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad
739298 no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom
739299 but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly
739300 who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him
739301 how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
739302 oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison
739303 i shall never let it drop until the gems are found never mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it
739304 no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now
739305 what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime
739306 i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it
739307 i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two
739308 pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up
739309 nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down
739310 you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows
739311 you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him
739312 yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing room and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet
739313 i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery
739314 but what is the good of all these vague theories
739315 when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands
739316 wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume
739317 yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom
739318 oh yes he is the green grocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper
739319 to the left of the door that is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door
739320 i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up
739321 that which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the lumber room
739322 it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it
739323 here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off
739324 but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it
739325 i do not know what to think it is all dark to me
739326 but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder
739327 your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him
739328 he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
739329 thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordi nary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your pemmission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
739330 i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder
739331 i can serve you best by returning to my rooms
739332 then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night
739333 if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw
739334 very good i shall look into the matter between this and then good bye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening
739335 l only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a will o the wisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours
739336 oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late
739337 oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly re spectable self
739338 but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning
739339 i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring
739340 i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried
739341 only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me
739342 yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room
739343 i feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i
739344 what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide
739345 no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles
739346 ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems
739347 you would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them
739348 that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your check book here is a pen better make it out for 4000 pounds
739349 no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one
739350 i told you yesterday and i repeat to day that it was not
739351 you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
739352 he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips
739353 for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery
739354 i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understand ing between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together
739355 it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in england a ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening
739356 i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night
739357 your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you
739358 as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfor tune this would be for you and how all important it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene
739359 you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret
739360 and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet
739361 there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a
739362 on entering the house however i examined as you remem
739363 it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
739364 and who could it be who was her confederate a lover
739365 well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his cast off shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks
739366 i saw an ill dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
739367 precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a life preserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held looo pounds apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work
739368 a day which has saved england from a great public scan dal
739369 sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologize to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now
739370 that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
739371 to the man who loves art for its own sake
739372 it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasion ally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province
739373 i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records
739374 it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter
739375 if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
739376 you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial
739377 but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest
739378 pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unob servant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zero point i fancy read it
739379 yes and i have no doubt that is her ring
739380 it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investiga tion it may be so in this case also
739381 well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question
739382 but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do
739383 pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you
739384 there is a well known agency for governesses in the west
739385 well when i called last week i was shown into the little
739386 that will do said he i could not ask for anything better
739387 i had 4 pounds a month in my last place with colonel spence
739388 tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question
739389 you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i
739390 it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant
739391 it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so
739392 and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they
739393 one child one dear little romper just six years old oh if
739394 i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement
739395 my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a
739396 no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he
739397 quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people
739398 or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to
739399 or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us
739400 i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr
739401 i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had
739402 i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little
739403 ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity
739404 the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
739405 do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she
739406 well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the
739407 well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and
739408 miss stoper has very kindly given me your address and
739409 that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought how ever that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
739410 well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question
739411 i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for
739412 ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
739413 well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind good natured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak
739414 that is a possible solution in fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
739415 well yes of course the pay is good too good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you 120 pounds a year when they could have their pick for 40 pounds there must be some strong reason behind
739416 i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me
739417 oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you
739418 it would cease to be a danger if we could define it
739419 but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help
739420 i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair to night and start for winchester to morrow
739421 she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself
739422 i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past
739423 that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning
739424 that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there
739425 they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
739426 but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indigna tion among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened
739427 no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away
739428 what can be the matter then can you suggest no expla nation
739429 i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell
739430 it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
739431 i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose
739432 in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual ill treatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them
739433 their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just
739434 i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as
739435 mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light gray eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill natured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite dispro portionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story
739436 whether they seem to you to be relevant or not
739437 i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one
739438 for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life
739439 oh yes said he turning to me we are very much
739440 the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar
739441 you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became
739442 jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the
739443 no no we should have him loitering here always kindly
739444 i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road
739445 you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may
739446 look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit be
739447 i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes
739448 the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened
739449 and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had
739450 i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint
739451 i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr
739452 this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in
739453 ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you
739454 i assured him that i was not offended by the way said
739455 he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled
739456 photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made
739457 well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that
739458 it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you
739459 there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and
739460 so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it
739461 my dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot
739462 but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i
739463 i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i an
739464 it is to keep people out who have no business there do
739465 well then you know now and if you ever put your foot
739466 i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were ali horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensi bility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do
739467 yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him
739468 that is well and the rucastles go out to night
739469 you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman
739470 we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely
739471 excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers possibly her fiance and no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and after wards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
739472 my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
739473 a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
739474 we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
739475 her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles
739476 now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
739477 i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
739478 this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off
739479 through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it
739480 heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it
739481 the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away
739482 he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
739483 you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have l you are in my power ill serve you
739484 someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late
739485 yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted
739486 it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else
739487 yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know
739488 then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark
739489 she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be
739490 i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment
739491 and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler
739492 but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his
739493 mr fowler was a very kind spoken free handed gentle man
739494 and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
739495 i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller
739496 for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
739497 i am afraid watson that i shall have to go
739498 i should be most happy to go down with you if i should not be in the way
739499 my dear watson you would confer a great favor upon me by coming and i think that your time will not be misspent for there are points about the case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one we have i think just time to catch our train at paddington and i will go further into the matter upon our journey you would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field glass
739500 our rate at present is fifty three and a half miles an hour
739501 nor have i but the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart and the calculation is a simple one i presume that you have looked into this matter of the murder of john straker and the disappearance of silver blaze
739502 i have seen what the telegraph and the chronicle have to say
739503 it is one of those cases where the art of the
739504 and this is thursday morning why didnt you go down yesterday
739505 because i made a blunder my dear watson which is i am afraid a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your memoirs the fact is that i could not believe is possible that the most remarkable horse in england could long remain concealed especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of dartmoor from hour to hour yesterday i expected to hear that he had been found and that his abductor was the murderer of john straker when however another morning had come and i found that beyond the arrest of young fitzroy simpson nothing had been done i felt that it was time for me to take action yet in some ways i feel that yesterday has not been wasted
739506 at least i have got a grip of the essential facts of the case i shall enumerate them to you for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person and i can hardly expect your co operation if i do not show you the position from which we start
739507 can you tell me where i am he asked i had almost
739508 oh indeed what a stroke of luck he cried i
739509 so youre one of those damned touts cried the lad ill show you how we serve them in kings pyland he sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog the girl fled away to the house but as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window a minute later however when hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone and though he ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him
739510 did the stable boy when he ran out with the dog leave the door unlocked behind him
739511 mrs straker awoke at seven in the morning to find
739512 the two lads who slept in the chaff cutting loft
739513 about a quarter of a mile from the stables john
739514 those are the main facts of the case stripped of all
739515 inspector gregory to whom the case has been committed is an extremely competent officer were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession on his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested there was little difficulty in finding him for he inhabited one of those villas which i have mentioned his name it appears was fitzroy simpson he was a man of excellent birth and education who had squandered a fortune upon the turf and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book making in the sporting clubs of london an examination of his betting book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favorite on being arrested he volunteered that statement that he had come down to dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the kings pyland horses and also about desborough the second favorite which was in charge of silas brown at the mapleton stables he did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before but declared that he had no sinister designs and had simply wished to obtain first hand information when confronted with his cravat he turned very pale and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man his wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before and his stick which was a penang lawyer weighted with lead was just such a weapon as might by repeated blows have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed on the other hand there was no wound upon his person while the state of strakers knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear his mark upon him there you have it all in a nutshell watson and if you can give me any light i shall be infinitely obliged to you
739516 that the incised would upon straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury
739517 in that case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears
739518 even now i fail to understand what the theory of the police can be
739519 i am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it
739520 the police imagine i take it that this fitzroy simpson having drugged the lad and having in some way obtained a duplicate key opened the stable door and took out the horse with the intention apparently of kidnapping him altogether his bridle is missing so that simpson must have put this on then having left the door open behind him he was leading the horse away over the moor when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer a row naturally ensued simpson beat out the trainers brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which straker used in self defence and then the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding place or else it may have bolted during the struggle and be now wandering out on the moors that is the case as it appears to the police and improbable as it is all other explanations are more improbable still however i shall very quickly test the matter when i am once upon the spot and until then i cannot really see how we can get much further than our present position
739521 i am delighted that you have come down mr holmes
739522 the inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested but i wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor straker and in recovering my horse
739523 i am sorry to say that we have made very little progress
739524 we have an open carriage outside and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails we might talk it over as we drive
739525 and i believe myself that he is our man at the same time i recognize that the evidence is purely circumstantial and that some new development may upset it
739526 we have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall
739527 my friend dr watson made that suggestion to me as we came down if so it would tell against this man simpson
739528 undoubtedly he has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound the evidence against him is certainly very strong he had a great interest in the disappearance of the favorite he lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable boy he was undoubtedly out in the storm he was armed with a heavy stick and his cravat was found in the dead mans hand i really think we have enough to go before a jury
739529 why should he take the horse out of the stable if he wished to injure it why could he not do it there has a duplicate key been found in his possession what chemist sold him the powdered opium above all where could he a stranger to the district hide a horse and such a horse as this what is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy
739530 he says that it was a ten pound note one was found in his purse but your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem he is not a stranger to the district he has twice lodged at tavistock in the summer the opium was probably brought from london the key having served its purpose would be hurled away the horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor
739531 he acknowledges that it is his and declares that he had lost it but a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable
739532 we have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place on tuesday they were gone now presuming that there was some understanding between simpson and these gypsies might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken and may they not have him now
739533 the moor is being scoured for these gypsies i have also examined every stable and out house in tavistock and for a radius of ten miles
739534 yes and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect as desborough their horse was second in the betting they had an interest in the disappearance of the favorite silas brown the trainer is known to have had large bets upon the event and he was no friend to poor straker we have however examined the stables and there is nothing to connect him with the affair
739535 and nothing to connect this man simpson with the interests of the mapleton stables
739536 perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime mr holmes
739537 i think that i should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail straker was brought back here i presume
739538 he has been in your service some years colonel ross
739539 i presume that you made an inventory of what he had in this pockets at the time of his death inspector
739540 i have the things themselves in the sitting room if you would care to see them
739541 i presume as i see blood stains upon it that it is the one which was found in the dead mans grasp watson this knife is surely in your line
739542 i thought so a very delicate blade devised for very delicate work a strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition especially as it would not shut in his pocket
739543 the tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body
739544 his wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing table and that he had picked it up as he left the room it was a poor weapon but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment
739545 three of them are receipted hay dealers accounts one of them is a letter of instructions from colonel ross this other is a milliners account for thirty seven pounds fifteen made out by madame lesurier of bond street to william derbyshire mrs straker tells us that derbyshire was a friend of her husbands and that occasionally his letters were addressed here
739546 twenty two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume however there appears to be nothing more to learn and we may now go down to the scene of the crime
739547 no mrs straker but mr holmes here has come from london to help us and we shall do all that is possible
739548 surely i met you in plymouth at a garden party some little time ago mrs straker
739549 dear me why i could have sworn to it you wore a costume of dove colored silk with ostrich feather trimming
739550 in that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze bush but placed there
739551 you fill me with interest i perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal no doubt many feet have been here since monday night
739552 a piece of matting has been laid here at the side and we have all stood upon that
739553 in this bag i have one of the boots which straker wore one of fitzroy simpsons shoes and a cast horseshoe of silver blaze
739554 it was invisible buried in the mud i only saw it because i was looking for it
739555 i have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction
739556 i should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say but i should like to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark that i may know my ground to morrow and i think that i shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck
739557 there are several points on which i should like your advice and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horses name from the entries for the cup
739558 i am very glad to have had your opinion sir
739559 you will find us at poor strakers house when you have finished your walk and we can drive together into tavistock
739560 we may leave the question of who killed john straker for the instant and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse now supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy where could he have gone to the horse is a very gregarious creature if left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to kings pyland or go over to mapleton why should he run wild upon the moor he would surely have been seen by now and why should gypsies kidnap him these people always clear out when they hear of trouble for they do not wish to be pestered by the police they could not hope to sell such a horse they would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him surely that is clear
739561 i have already said that he must have gone to kings pyland or to mapleton he is not at kings pyland therefore he is at mapleton let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to this part of the moor as the inspector remarked is very hard and dry but if falls away towards mapleton and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder which must have been very wet on monday night if our supposition is correct then the horse must have crossed that and there is the point where we should look for his tracks
739562 it is the one quality which gregory lacks we imagined what might have happened acted upon the supposition and find ourselves justified let us proceed
739563 quite so it was alone before hullo what is this
739564 you have saved us a long walk which would have brought us back on our own traces let us follow the return track
739565 should i be too early to see your master mr silas brown if i were to call at five oclock to morrow morning
739566 bless you sir if any one is about he will be for he is always the first stirring but here he is sir to answer your questions for himself no sir no it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money afterwards if you like
739567 no gossiping go about your business and you what the devil do you want here
739568 ive no time to talk to every gadabout we want no stranger here be off or you may find a dog at your heels
739569 very good shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor
739570 i shall not keep you more than a few minutes watson
739571 you instructions will be done it shall all be done
739572 oh no there shall be no mistake it shall be there should i change it first or not
739573 yes i think i can well you shall hear from me to morrow
739574 a more perfect compound of the bully coward and sneak than master silas brown i have seldom met with
739575 he tried to bluster out of it but i described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that i was watching him of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them again of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing i described to him how when according to his custom he was the first down he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor how he went out to it and his astonishment at recognizing from the white forehead which has given the favorite its name that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money then i described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to kings pyland and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over and how he had led it back and concealed it at mapleton when i told him every detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin
739576 oh and old horse fakir like him has many a dodge
739577 but are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now since he has every interest in injuring it
739578 my dear fellow he will guard it as the apple of his eye he knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe
739579 colonel ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy in any case
739580 the matter does not rest with colonel ross i follow my own methods and tell as much or as little as i choose that is the advantage of being unofficial i dont know whether you observed it watson but the colonels manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me i am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense say nothing to him about the horse
739581 and of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the question of who killed john straker
739582 on the contrary we both go back to london by the night train
739583 my friend and i return to town by the night express
739584 we have had a charming little breath of your beautiful dartmoor air
739585 so you despair of arresting the murderer of poor straker
739586 i have every hope however that your horse will start upon tuesday and i beg that you will have your jockey in readiness might i ask for a photograph of mr john straker
739587 my dear gregory you anticipate all my wants if i might ask you to wait here for an instant i have a question which i should like to put to the maid
739588 i must say that i am rather disappointed in our london consultant
739589 i do not see that we are any further than when he came
739590 at least you have his assurance that your horse will run
739591 well sir not of much account but three of them have gone lame sir
739592 gregory let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep drive on coachman
739593 is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention
739594 to the curious incident of the dog in the night time
739595 i suppose that you would know him when you saw him
739596 i have been on the turf for twenty years and never was asked such a question as that before
739597 a child would know silver blaze with his white forehead and his mottled off foreleg
739598 well that is the curious part of it you could have got fifteen to one yesterday but the price has become shorter and shorter until you can hardly get three to one now
739599 we scratched our other one and put all hopes on your word
739600 five to four against silver blaze five to fifteen against desborough five to four on the field
739601 but i dont see him my colors have not passed
739602 that beast has not a white hair upon its body what is this that you have done mr holmes
739603 i confess that i can make neither head nor tail of it dont you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough mr holmes
739604 certainly colonel you shall know everything let us all go round and have a look at the horse together here he is
739605 you have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine and you will find that he is the same old silver blaze as ever
739606 i found him in the hands of a fakir and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over
739607 my dear sir you have done wonders the horse looks very fit and well it never went better in its life i owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability you have done me a great service by recovering my horse you would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of john straker
739608 i quite recognize that i am under obligations to you mr holmes
739609 but i must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult
739610 i assure you that i have not associated you with the crime colonel
739611 yes the horse and it may lessen his guilt if i say that it was done in self defence and that john straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence but there goes the bell and as i stand to win a little on this next race i shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time
739612 that any theories which i had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous and yet there were indications there had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import i went to devonshire with the conviction that fitzroy simpson was the true culprit although of course i saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete it was while i was in the carriage just as we reached the trainers house that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me you may remember that i was distrait and remained sitting after you had all alighted i was marvelling in my own mind how i could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue
739613 that even now i cannot see how it helps us
739614 it was the first link in my chain of reasoning
739615 and they did so you cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead mans hand a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon it was as dr watson told us a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery and it was to be used for a delicate operation that night you must know with your wide experience of turf matters colonel ross that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horses ham and to do it subcutaneously so as to leave absolutely no trace a horse so treated would develop a slight lameness which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism but never to foul play
739616 we have here the explanation of why john straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor so spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife it was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air
739617 of course that was why he needed the candle and struck the match
739618 from that time on all was plain straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible simpson in his flight had dropped his cravat and straker had picked it up with some idea perhaps that he might use it in securing the horses leg once in the hollow he had got behind the horse and had struck a light but the creature frightened at the sudden glare and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended had lashed out and the steel shoe had struck straker full on the forehead he had already in spite of the rain taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task and so as he fell his knife gashed his thigh do i make it clear
739619 my final shot was i confess a very long one it
739620 when i returned to london i called upon the milliner who had recognized straker as an excellent customer of the name of derbyshire who had a very dashing wife with a strong partiality for expensive dresses i have no doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt and so led him into this miserable plot
739621 ah it bolted and was cared for by one of your neighbors we must have an amnesty in that direction i think this is clapham junction if i am not mistaken and we shall be in victoria in less than ten minutes if you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms colonel i shall be happy to give you any other details which might interest you
739622 half an hour sir he was a very restless gentleman sir a walkin and a stampin all the time he was here i was waitin outside the door sir and i could hear him at last he out into the passage and he cries is that man never goin to come those were his very words sir youll only need to wait a little longer says i then ill wait in the open air for i feel half choked says he ill be back before long and with that he ups and he outs and all i could say wouldnt hold him back
739623 its very annoying though watson i was badly in need of a case and this looks from the mans impatience as if it were of importance hullo thats not your pipe on the table he must have left his behind him a nice old brier with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber i wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in london some people think that a fly in it is a sign well he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly
739624 well i should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence now it has you see been twice mended once in the wooden stem and once in the amber each of these mends done as you observe with silver bands must have cost more than the pipe did originally the man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money
739625 nothing has more individuality save perhaps watches and bootlaces the indications here however are neither very marked nor very important the owner is obviously a muscular man left handed with an excellent set of teeth careless in his habits and with no need to practise economy
739626 you think a man must be well to do if he smokes a seven shilling pipe
739627 as he might get an excellent smoke for half the price he has no need to practise economy
739628 he has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas jets you can see that it is quite charred all down one side of course a match could not have done that why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe but you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred and it is all on the right side of the pipe from that i gather that he is a left handed man you hold your own pipe to the lamp and see how naturally you being right handed hold the left side to the flame you might do it once the other way but not as a constancy this has always been held so then he has bitten through his amber it takes a muscular energetic fellow and one with a good set of teeth to do that but if i am not mistaken i hear him upon the stair so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study
739629 i suppose i should have knocked yes of course i should have knocked the fact is that i am a little upset and you must put it all down to that
739630 i can see that you have not slept for a night or two
739631 that tries a mans nerves more than work and more even than pleasure may i ask how i can help you
739632 i wanted your advice sir i dont know what to do and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces
739633 not that only i want your opinion as a judicious man as a man of the world i want to know what i ought to do next i hope to god youll be able to tell me
739634 one does not like to speak of ones domestic affairs to strangers it seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of ones wife with two men whom i have never seen before its horrible to have to do it but ive got to the end of my tether and i must have advice
739635 i would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat or else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing i was about to say that my friend and i have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls i trust that we may do as much for you might i beg you as time may prove to be of importance to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay
739636 now there is one thing that i want to impress upon you before i go any further mr holmes effie loves me dont let there be any mistake about that she loves me with her whole heart and soul and never more than now i know it i feel it i dont want to argue about that a man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him but theres this secret between us and we can never be the same until it is cleared
739637 ill tell you what i know about effies history she
739638 i am a hop merchant myself and as i have an income
739639 theres one thing i ought to tell you before i go
739640 jack said she when you took my money you said
739641 i was a bit staggered at this for i had imagined it
739642 oh said she in her playful way you said that
739643 if you really mean it of course you shall have the
739644 and you wont tell me what you want it for
739645 so i had to be content with that thought it was the
739646 well i told you just now that there is a cottage not
739647 well last monday evening i was taking a stroll down
739648 i dont know what there was about that face mr
739649 what may you be wantin she asked in a northern
739650 ay well just ask ye when we want ye said she
739651 i am usually an extremely sound sleeper it has been
739652 i had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing
739653 where in the world have you been effie i asked as
739654 she gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry
739655 all the time that she was telling me this story she
739656 i should have gone to the city that day but i was
739657 i went as far as the crystal palace spent an hour in
739658 i was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of
739659 ah jack she said i have just been in to see if
739660 so said i this is where you went during the
739661 you came here i am sure of it who are these
739662 how can you tell me what you know is false i
739663 i implore you not to do this jack she cried i
739664 i will trust you on one condition and on one
739665 i was sure that you would trust me she cried with
739666 still pulling at my sleeve she led me away from the
739667 for two days after this i stayed at home and my wife
739668 i had gone into town on that day but i returned by
739669 i think that she has gone out for a walk she
739670 it was all still and quiet upon the ground floor in
739671 i stayed long enough to make certain that the house
739672 i am sorry that i broke my promise jack said she
739673 until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage and who it is to whom you have given that photograph there can never be any confidence between us said i and breaking away from her i left the house that was yesterday mr holmes and i have not seen her since nor do i know anything more about this strange business it is the first shadow that has come between us and it has so shaken me that i do not know what i should do for the best suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me so i have hurried to you now and i place myself unreservedly in your hands if there is any point which i have not made clear pray question me about it but above all tell me quickly what i am to do for this misery is more than i can bear
739674 could you swear that this was a mans face which you saw at the window
739675 each time that i saw it i was some distance away from it so that it is impossible for me to say
739676 you appear however to have been disagreeably impressed by it
739677 it seemed to be of an unnatural color and to have a strange rigidity about the features when i approached it vanished with a jerk
739678 how long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds
739679 have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband
739680 no there was a great fire at atlanta very shortly after his death and all her papers were destroyed
739681 and yet she had a certificate of death you say that you saw it
739682 did you ever meet any one who knew her in america
739683 thank you i should like to think over the matter a little now if the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty if on the other hand as i fancy is more likely the inmates were warned of you coming and left before you entered yesterday then they may be back now and we should clear it all up easily let me advise you then to return to norbury and to examine the windows of the cottage again if you have reason to believe that is inhabited do not force your way in but send a wire to my friend and me we shall be with you within an hour of receiving it and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business
739684 in that case i shall come out to morrow and talk it over with you good by and above all do not fret until you know that you really have a cause for it
739685 i am afraid that this is a bad business watson
739686 yes theres blackmail in it or i am much mistaken
739687 well it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place and has her photograph above his fireplace upon my word watson there is something very attractive about that livid face at the window and i would not have missed the case for worlds
739688 yes a provisional one but i shall be surprised if it does not turn out to be correct this womans first husband is in that cottage
739689 how else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it the facts as i read them are something like this this woman was married in america her husband developed some hateful qualities or shall we say that he contracted some loathsome disease and became a leper or an imbecile she flies from him at last returns to england changes her name and starts her life as she thinks afresh she has been married three years and believes that her position is quite secure having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose name she has assumed when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered by her first husband or we may suppose by some unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the invalid they write to the wife and threaten to come and expose her she asks for a hundred pounds and endeavors to buy them off they come in spite of it and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there a new comers in the cottage she knows in some way that they are her pursuers she waits until her husband is asleep and then she rushes down to endeavor to persuade them to leave her in peace having no success she goes again next morning and her husband meets her as he has told us as she comes out she promises him then not to go there again but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbors was too strong for her and she made another attempt taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her in the midst of this interview the maid rushed in to say that the master had come home on which the wife knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage hurried the inmates out at the back door into the grove of fir trees probably which was mentioned as standing near in this way he found the place deserted i shall be very much surprised however if it still so when he reconnoitres it this evening what do you think of my theory
739690 but at least it covers all the facts when new facts come to our knowledge which cannot be covered by it it will be time enough to reconsider it we can do nothing more until we have a message from our friend at norbury
739691 have seen the face again at the window will meet the seven oclock train and will take no steps until you arrive
739692 i saw lights in the cottage as i came down we shall settle it now once and for all
739693 i am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house i wish you both to be there as witnesses
739694 you are quite determined to do this in spite of your wifes warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery
739695 well i think that you are in the right any truth is better than indefinite doubt we had better go up at once of course legally we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong but i think that it is worth it
739696 and here is the cottage which i am going to enter
739697 you can see for yourselves that some one is there now follow me and we shall soon know all
739698 i had a presentiment that you would come this evening think better of it dear trust me again and you will never have cause to regret it
739699 leave go of me i must pass you my friends and i are going to settle this matter once and forever
739700 you have forced me against my own judgment to tell you and now we must both make the best of it my husband died at atlanta my child survived
739701 and a nobler man never walked the earth i cut myself off from my race in order to wed him but never once while he lived did i for an instant regret it it was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine it is often so in such matches and little lucy is darker far than ever her father was but dark or fair she is my own dear little girlie and her mothers pet
739702 it was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied i should have waited for the morning but i could not sleep for excitement and so at last i slipped out knowing how difficult it is to awake you but you saw me go and that was the beginning of my troubles next day you had my secret at your mercy but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage three days later however the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one and now to night you at last know all and i ask you what is to become of us my child and me
739703 i am not a very good man effie but i think that i am a better one than you have given me credit for being
739704 that we shall be of more use in london than in norbury
739705 if it should ever strike you that i am getting a little over confident in my powers or giving less pains to a case than it deserves kindly whisper norbury in my ear and i shall be infinitely obliged to you
739706 i am very delighted to see you i trust that mrs watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the sign of four
739707 that the cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our little deductive problems
739708 it was only last night that i was looking over my old notes and classifying some of our past results
739709 not at all i should wish nothing better than to have some more of such experiences
739710 i do my neighbors when he goes he is always ready to work off the debt
739711 i perceive that you have been unwell lately summer colds are always a little trying
739712 i was confined to the house by a sever chill for three days last week i thought however that i had cast off every trace of it
739713 you could not have had them more than a few weeks the soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched for a moment i thought they might have got wet and been burned in the drying but near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the shopmans hieroglyphics upon it damp would of course have removed this you had then been sitting with our feet outstretched to the fire which a man would hardly do even in so wet a june as this if he were in his full health
739714 i am afraid that i rather give myself away when i explain
739715 results without causes are much more impressive you are ready to come to birmingham then
739716 you shall hear it all in the train my client is outside in a four wheeler can you come at once
739717 just the same as mine both have been ever since the houses were built
739718 ah then you got hold of the best of the two
739719 by the steps my boy yours are worn three inches deeper than his but this gentleman in the cab is my client mr hall pycroft allow me to introduce you to him whip your horse up cabby for we have only just time to catch our train
739720 i want you mr hall pycroft to tell my friend your very interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me or with more detail if possible it will be of use to me to hear the succession of events again it is a case watson which may prove to have something in it or may prove to have nothing but which at least presents those unusual and outr features which are as dear to you as they are to me now mr pycroft i shall not interrupt you again
739721 the fact is that i have heard some really extraordinary stories about your financial ability you remember parker who used to be coxons manager he can never say enough about it
739722 have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work
739723 that is the way to prosper you wont mind my testing you will you let me see how are ayrshires
739724 a hundred and six and a quarter to a hundred and five and seven eighths
739725 this quite fits in with all that i had heard my boy my boy you are very much too good to be a clerk at mawsons
739726 other people dont think quite so much of me as you seem to do mr pinner i had a hard enough fight to get this berth and i am very glad to have it
739727 pooh man you should soar above it you are not in your true sphere now ill tell you how it stands with me what i have to offer is little enough when measured by your ability but when compared with mawsons its light to dark let me see when do you go to mawsons
739728 ha ha i think i would risk a little sporting flutter that you dont go there at all
739729 no sir by that day you will be the business manager of the franco midland hardware company limited with a hundred and thirty four branches in the towns and villages of france not counting one in brussels and one in san remo
739730 very likely not it has been kept very quiet for the capital was all privately subscribed and its too good a thing to let the public into my brother harry pinner is promoter and joins the board after allotment as managing director he knew i was in the swim down here and asked me to pick up a good man cheap a young pushing man with plenty of snap about him parker spoke of you and that brought me here tonight we can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with
739731 only that at the beginning but you are to have an overriding commission of one per cent on all business done by your agents and you may take my word for it that this will come to more than your salary
739732 you are the very man for us you are not to be talked over and quite right too now heres a note for a hundred pounds and if you think that we can do business you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary
739733 i have a note in my pocket here which you will take to my brother you will find him at 126b corporation street where the temporary offices of the company are situated of course he must confirm your engagement but between ourselves it will be all right
739734 really i hardly know how to express my gratitude mr pinner
739735 not at all my boy you have only got your desserts there are one or two small things mere formalities which i must arrange with you you have a bit of paper beside you there kindly write upon it i am perfectly willing to act as business manager to the franco midland hardware company limited at a minimum salary of l500
739736 precisely what i dont want you to do i had a row
739737 he would rather have our small price than your big
739738 ill lay you a fiver said i that when he has my
739739 done said he we picked him out of the gutter and he wont leave us so easily those were his very words
739740 ive never so much as seen him in my life why should i consider him in any way i shall certainly not write if you would rather i didnt
739741 well im delighted to have got so good a man for my brother heres your advance of a hundred pounds and here is the letter make a not of the address 126b corporation street and remember that one oclock to morrow is your appointment good night and may you have all the fortune that you deserve
739742 oh i was expecting you but you are a trifle before your time i had a note from my brother this morning in which he sang your praises very loudly
739743 i was just looking for the offices when you came
739744 we have not got our name up yet for we only secured these temporary premises last week come up with me and we will talk the matter over
739745 rome was not built in a day and we have lots of money at our backs though we dont cut much dash yet in offices pray sit down and let me have your letter
739746 you seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother arthur
739747 and i know that he is a pretty shrewd judge hew swears by london you know and i by birmingham but this time i shall follow his advice pray consider yourself definitely engaged
739748 you will eventually manage the great depot in paris which will pour a flood of english crockery into the shops of a hundred and thirty four agents in france the purchase will be completed in a week and meanwhile you will remain in birmingham and make yourself useful
739749 with the trades after the names of the people i want you to take it home with you and to mark off al the hardware sellers with their addresses it would be of the greatest use to me to have them
739750 not reliable ones their system is different from ours stick at it and let me have the lists by monday at twelve good day mr pycroft if you continue to show zeal and intelligence you will find the company a good master
739751 i fear that i underrated the difficulty of the task this list will be of very material assistance to me
739752 i want you to make a list of the furniture shops for they all sell crockery
739753 and you can come up to morrow evening at seven and let me know how you are getting on dont overwork yourself a couple of hours at days music hall in the evening would do you no harm after your labors
739754 you may well look surprised dr watson but it is this way
739755 when i was speaking to the other chap in london at the time that he laughed at my not going to mawsons i happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion the glint of the gold in each case caught my eye you see when i put that with the voice and figure being the same and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig i could not doubt that it was the same man of course you expect two brothers to be alike but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way he bowed me out and i found myself in the street hardly knowing whether i was on my head or my heels back i went to my hotel put my head in a basin of cold water and tried to think it out why had he sent me from london to birmingham why had he got there before me and why had he written a letter from himself to himself it was altogether too much for me and i could make no sense of it and then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to mr sherlock holmes i had just time to get up to town by the night train to see him this morning and to bring you both back with me to birmingham
739756 there are points in it which please me i think that you will agree with me that an interview with mr arthur harry pinner in the temporary offices of the franco midland hardware company limited would be a rather interesting experience for both of us
739757 you are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet and what could be more natural than that i should bring you both round to the managing director
739758 it is no use our being at all before our time
739759 he only comes there to see me apparently for the place is deserted up to the very hour he names
739760 these are the companys offices into which he has gone come with me and ill fix it up as easily as possible
739761 who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you
739762 one is mr harris of bermondsey and the other is mr price of this town
739763 they are friends of mine and gentlemen of experience but they have been out of a place for some little time and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the companys employment
739764 yes i have no doubt that we shall be able to do something for you what is your particular line mr harris
739765 ah yes we shall want something of the sort and you mr price
739766 i have every hope that the company may accommodate you i will let you know about it as soon as we come to any conclusion and now i beg that you will go for gods sake leave me to myself
739767 you forget mr pinner that i am here by appointment to receive some directions from you
739768 you may wait here a moment and there is no reason why your friends should not wait with you i will be entirely at your service in three minutes if i might trespass upon your patience so far
739769 then what on earth can he be doing there is something which i dont understand in his manner if ever a man was three parts mad with terror that mans name is pinner what can have put the shivers on him
739770 he did not turn pale he was pale when we entered the room
739771 what the deuce is he knocking at his own door for
739772 but hell live now just open that window and hand me the water carafe
739773 i suppose we ought to call the police in now
739774 and yet i confess that id like to give them a complete case when they come
739775 i think that it is fairly obvious what do you say watson
739776 i must confess that i am out of my depths
739777 oh surely if you consider the events at first they can only point to one conclusion
739778 well the whole thing hinges upon two points the first is the making of pycroft write a declaration by which he entered the service of this preposterous company do you not see how very suggestive that is
739779 well why did they want him to do it not as a business matter for these arrangements are usually verbal and there was no earthly business reason why this should be an exception dont you see my young friend that they were very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting and had no other way of doing it
739780 quite so why when we answer that we have made some progress with our little problem why there can be only one adequate reason some one wanted to learn to imitate your writing and had to procure a specimen of it first and now if we pass on to the second point we find that each throws light upon the other that point is the request made by pinner that you should not resign your place but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a mr hall pycroft whom he had never seen was about to enter the office upon the monday morning
739781 now you see the point about the handwriting suppose that some one turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand from that in which you had applied for the vacancy of course the game would have been up but in the interval the rogue had learned to imitate you and his position was therefore secure as i presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you
739782 very good of course it was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking better of it and also to keep you from coming into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was at work in mawsons office therefore they gave you a handsome advance on your salary and ran you off to the midlands where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to london where you might have burst their little game up that is all plain enough
739783 but why should this man pretend to be his won brother
739784 well that is pretty clear also there are evidently only two of them in it the other is personating you at the office this one acted as your engager and then found that he could not find you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot that he was most unwilling to do he changed his appearance as far as he could and trusted that the likeness which you could not fail to observe would be put down to a family resemblance but for the happy chance of the gold stuffing your suspicions would probably never have been aroused
739785 while i have been fooled in this way what has this other hall pycroft been doing at mawsons what should we do mr holmes tell me what to do
739786 ah yes they keep a permanent guard there on account of the value of the securities that they hold i remember hearing it talked of in the city
739787 very good we shall wire to him and see if all is well and if a clerk of your name is working there that is clear enough but what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues should instantly walk out of the room and hang himself
739788 idiot that i was i thought so must of our visit that the paper never entered my head for an instant to be sure the secret must be there
739789 it is a london paper an early edition of the evening standard here is what we want look at the headlines crime in the city murder at mawson amp williamss gigantic attempted robbery capture of the criminal here watson we are all equally anxious to hear it so kindly read it aloud to us
739790 it is customary at mawsons for the clerks to leave at midday on saturday sergeant tuson of the city police was somewhat surprised therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one his suspicions being aroused the sergeant followed the man and with the aid of constable pollack succeeded after a most desperate resistance in arresting him it was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of american railway bonds with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies was discovered in the bag on examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes where it would not have been discovered until monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of sergeant tuson the mans skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind there could be no doubt that beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him and having murdered the watchman rapidly rifled the large safe and then made off with his booty his brother who usually works with him has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be ascertained although the police are making energetic inquiries as to his whereabouts
739791 well we may save the police some little trouble in that direction
739792 human nature is a strange mixture watson you see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited however we have no choice as to our action the doctor and i will remain on guard mr pycroft if you will have the kindness to step out for the police
739793 which i really think watson that it would be worth your while to glance over these are the documents in the extraordinary case of the gloria scott and this is the message which struck justice of the peace trevor dead with horror when he read it
739794 the supply of game for london is going steadily up
739795 head keeper hudson we believe had been now told to receive all orders for fly paper and for preservation of you life
739796 i cannot see how such a message as this could inspire horror it seems to me to be rather grotesque than otherwise
739797 very likely yet the fact remains that the reader who was a fine robust old man was knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt end of a pistol
739798 but why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why i should study this case
739799 because it was the first in which i was ever engaged
739800 he was the only friend i made during the two years i
739801 it was a prosaic way of forming a friendship but it
739802 old trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and
739803 trevor senior was a widower and my friend his only
739804 there had been a daughter i heard but she had died
739805 i fear there is not very much i answered i might
739806 the laugh faded from his lips and he stared at me in
739807 right again how did you know it is my nose
739808 no said i it is your ears they have the
739809 you have done a good deal of digging by your
739810 mr trevor stood slowly up fixed his large blue eyes
739811 you can imagine watson how shocked both his son and
739812 ah boys said he forcing a smile i hope i
739813 i hope that i have said nothing to pain you said
739814 we were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs
739815 he says that you know him and that he only wants a
739816 well my man said he what can i do for you
739817 why dear me it is surely hudson said mr trevor
739818 tut you will find that i have not forgotten old
739819 bless you sir i know where all my old friends
739820 all this occurred during the first month of the long
739821 he met me with the dog cart at the station and i saw
739822 i was as you may think watson horrified at this
739823 ah that is the point jump in and we can talk it
739824 do you know who it was that we let into the house
739825 yes it was the devil himself we have not had a
739826 ah that is what i would give so much to know the
739827 well matters went from bad to worse with us and
739828 it is all very well to talk but you dont know how i am placed but you shall know victor ill see that you shall know come what may you wouldnt believe harm of your poor old father would you lad
739829 that evening there came what seemed to me to be a
739830 ill run down to mr beddoes in hampshire hell be as glad to see me as you were i dare say
739831 he slouched out of the room and half an hour
739832 as he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue
739833 only that the papers were in the back drawer of the
739834 my friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of
739835 i dare say my face looked as bewildered as your did
739836 and then in an instant the key of the riddle was in
739837 it was short and terse the warning as i now read it
739838 the game is up hudson has told all fly for your
739839 it means nothing to the message but it might mean a
739840 why now that you mention it said he i remember
739841 alas holmes i fear that it is one of sin and
739842 these are the very papers watson which he handed to
739843 if then your eye goes onto read this line i know
739844 my name dear lad is not trevor i was james
739845 it was the year 55 when the crimean war was at its
739846 i answered him and asked in turn who i was talking
739847 and by god youll learn to bless my name before youve done with me
739848 i remembered hearing of his case for it was one
739849 by god ive go more pounds to my name than youve hairs on your head and if youve money my son and know how to handle it and spread it you can do anything now you dont think it likely that a man who could do anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold of a rat gutted beetle ridden mouldy old coffin of a chin china coaster no sir such a man will look after himself and will look after his chums you may lay to that you hold on to him and you may kiss the book that hell haul you through
739850 that was his style of talk and at first i thought
739851 a rare good man as true as a stock to a barrel hes got the dibbs he has and where do you think he is at this moment why hes the chaplain of this ship the chaplain no less he came aboard with a black coat and his papers right and money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to main truck the crew are his body and soul he could buy em at so much a gross with a cash discount and he did it before ever they signed on hes got two of the warders and mereer the second mate and hed get the captain himself if he thought him worth it
739852 well make the coats of some of these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did
739853 i did so and found my other neighbor to be a young
739854 the state room was next the cabin and we flocked in
739855 and now i come to the most surprising part of my
739856 it was a long hour before we reached it and at
739857 such in a few words my dear boy is the history of
739858 underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be
739859 that was the narrative which i read that night to young trevor and i think watson that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one the good fellow was heart broken at it and went out to the terai tea planting where i hear that he is doing well as to the sailor and beddoes neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on which the letter of warning was written they both disappeared utterly and completely no complaint had been lodged with he police so that beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed hudson had been seen lurking about and it was believed by the police that he had done away with beddoes and had fled for myself i believe that the truth was exactly the opposite i think that it is most probable that beddoes pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been already betrayed had revenged himself upon hudson and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on those are the facts of the case doctor and if they are of any use to your collection i am sure that they are very heartily at your service
739860 i think that if you knew all that i had in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in
739861 i have often wished that i had notes of those cases
739862 yes my boy these were all done prematurely before my biographer had come to glorify me
739863 but there are some pretty little problems among them heres the record of the tarleton murders and the case of vamberry the wine merchant and the adventure of the old russian woman and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch as well as a full account of ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife and here ah now this really is something a little recherch
739864 well my boy what do you make of this lot
739865 very curious and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still
739866 are all that i have left to remind me of the adventure of the musgrave ritual
739867 you may remember how the affair of the gloria scott
739868 when i first came up to london i had rooms in
739869 for four years i had seen nothing of him until one
739870 you probably heard of my poor fathers death said he he was carried off about two years ago since then i have of course had the hurlstone estates to manage and as i am member for my district as well my life has been a busy one but i understand holmes that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us
739871 yes said i i have taken to living by my wits
739872 i am delighted to hear it for your advice at
739873 you must know said he that though i am a
739874 of these servants the one who had been longest in
739875 but this paragon has one fault he is a bit of a
739876 this was how it came about i have said that the
739877 i have said that the house is a rambling one one
739878 in order to reach the billiard room i had to descend
739879 this is how you repay the trust which we have reposed in you you will leave my service to morrow
739880 he bowed with the look of a man who is utterly
739881 i cant bear disgrace sir ive always been proud above my station in life and disgrace would kill me my blood will be on your head sir it will indeed if you drive me to despair if you cannot keep me after what has passed then for gods sake let me give you notice and leave in a month as if of my own free will i could stand that mr musgrave but not to be cast out before all the folk that i know so well
739882 your conduct has been most infamous however as you have been a long time in the family i have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you a month however is too long take yourself away in a week and give what reason you like for going
739883 and you may consider yourself to have been very leniently dealt with
739884 he crept away his face sunk upon his breast like a
739885 she looked at me with so strange an expression that
739886 you must stop work now and when you go downstairs just say that i wish to see brunton
739887 of course we had the drags at once and set to work
739888 he handed me the very paper which i have here
739889 north by ten and by ten east by five and by five
739890 the original has no date but is in the spelling of
739891 at least said i it gives us another mystery and
739892 but to me it seems immensely practical and i fancy
739893 it is very possible we took no pains to hide it
739894 that is true but what could he have to do with
739895 i dont think that we should have much difficulty in
739896 that was there when you ritual was drawn up said
739897 there used to be a very old one over yonder but it
739898 we had driven up in a dogcart and my client led me
739899 i suppose it is impossible to find out how high the
739900 i can give you it at once it was sixty four feet
739901 how do you come to know it i asked in surprise
739902 when my old tutor used to give me an exercise in
739903 this was an unexpected piece of luck my data were
739904 tell me i asked did your butler ever ask you
739905 this was excellent news watson for it showed me that i was on the right road i looked up at the sun it was low in the heavens and i calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak one condition mentioned in the ritual would then be fulfilled and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide i had then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak
739906 that must have been difficult holmes when the elm was no longer there
739907 well at least i knew that if brunton could do it i
739908 of course the calculation now was a simple one if a
739909 i had thought that it meant that we were to dig but
739910 yes and as old as the house down here through
739911 we went down a winding stone stair and my companion
739912 it had been used for the storage of wood but the
739913 at my suggestion a couple of the county police were
739914 a small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet
739915 at the moment however we had no thought for the old
739916 you know my methods in such cases watson i put
739917 but for two of them and one a woman it must have
739918 and now how was i to proceed to reconstruct this
739919 here was the secret of her blanched face her shaken
739920 we may find something else of charles the first i
739921 we ascended to his study and he laid the debris
739922 you must bear in mind said i that the royal
739923 it is nothing less than the ancient crown of the
739924 ah that is a question that will take some time to
739925 and how was it then that charles did not get his
739926 ah there you lay your finger upon the one point
739927 and thats the story of the musgrave ritual watson they have the crown down at hurlstone though they had some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it i am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you of the woman nothing was ever heard and the probability is that she got away out of england and carried herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas
739928 i think ill take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm
739929 yes weve had a scare in this part lately old acton who is one of our county magnates had his house broken into last monday no great damage done but the fellows are still at large
739930 none as yet but the affair is a pretty one one of our little country crimes which must seem too small for your attention mr holmes after this great international affair
739931 i fancy not the thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains the whole place was turned upside down drawers burst open and presses ransacked with the result that an odd volume of popes homer two plated candlesticks an ivory letter weight a small oak barometer and a ball of twine are all that have vanished
739932 oh the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could get
739933 you are here for a rest my dear fellow for heavens sake dont get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds
739934 neither sir it was william the coachman shot through the heart sir and never spoke again
739935 the burglar sir he was off like a shot and got clean away hed just broke in at the pantry window when william came on him and met his end in saving his masters property
739936 hes our leading man about here is old cunningham and a very decent fellow too hell be cut up over this for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant its evidently the same villains who broke into actons
739937 hum it may prove the simplest matter in the world but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious is it not a gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days when you spoke last night of taking precautions i remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in england to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention which shows that i have still much to learn
739938 in that case of course actons and cunninghams are just the places he would go for since they are far the largest about here
739939 well they ought to be but theyve had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them i fancy old acton has some claim on half cunninghams estate and the lawyers have been at it with both hands
739940 if its a local villain there should not be much difficulty in running him down
739941 i hope i dont intrude but we hear that mr holmes of baker street is here
739942 we thought that perhaps you would care to step across mr holmes
739943 we were chatting about the matter when you came in inspector perhaps you can let us have a few details
739944 we had no clue in the acton affair but here we have plenty to go on and theres no doubt it is the same party in each case the man was seen
739945 yes sir but he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor william kirwan was fired mr cunningham saw him from the bedroom window and mr alec cunningham saw him from the back passage it was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out mr cunningham had just got into bed and mr alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing gown they both heard william the coachman calling for help and mr alec ran down to see what was the matter the back door was open and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside one of them fired a shot the other dropped and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge mr cunningham looking out of his bedroom saw the fellow as he gained the road but lost sight of him at once mr alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man and so the villain got clean away beyond the fact that he was a middle sized man and dressed in some dark stuff we have no personal clue but we are making energetic inquiries and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out
739946 what was this william doing there did he say anything before he died
739947 not a word he lives at the lodge with his mother and as he was a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there of course this acton business has put every one on their guard the robber must have just burst open the door the lock has been forced when william came upon him
739948 did william say anything to his mother before going out
739949 she is very old and deaf and we can get no information from her the shock has made her half witted but i understand that she was never very bright there is one very important circumstance however look at this
739950 this was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man it appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet you will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer it reads almost as though it were an appointment
739951 it is of course a conceivable theory that this william kirwan though he had the reputation of being an honest man may have been in league with the thief he may have met him there may even have helped him to break in the door and then they may have fallen out between themselves
739952 i should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case there is something in it which fascinates me extremely if you will permit me colonel i will leave my friend watson and you and i will step round with the inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine i will be with you again in half an hour
739953 mr holmes is walking up and down in the field outside
739954 he wants us all four to go up to the house together
739955 i dont quite know sir between ourselves i think mr holmes had not quite got over his illness yet hes been behaving very queerly and he is very much excited
739956 i have usually found that there was method in his madness
739957 some folks might say there was madness in his method
739958 but hes all on fire to start colonel so we had best go out if you are ready
739959 watson your country trip has been a distinct success i have had a charming morning
739960 you have been up to the scene of the crime i understand
739961 yes the inspector and i have made quite a little reconnaissance together
739962 well we have seen some very interesting things ill tell you what we did as we walk first of all we saw the body of this unfortunate man he certainly died from a revolved wound as reported
739963 oh it is as well to test everything our inspection was not wasted we then had an interview with mr cunningham and his son who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden hedge in his flight that was of great interest
739964 then we had a look at this poor fellows mother we could get no information from her however as she is very old and feeble
739965 the conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure i think that we are both agreed inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead mans hand bearing as it does the very hour of his death written upon it is of extreme importance
739966 it does give a clue whoever wrote that note was the man who brought william kirwan out of his bed at that hour but where is the rest of that sheet of paper
739967 i examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it
739968 it was torn out of the dead mans hand why was some one so anxious to get possession of it because it incriminated him and what would he do with it thrust it into his pocket most likely never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse if we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery
739969 yes but how can we get at the criminals pocket before we catch the criminal
739970 well well it was worth thinking over then there is another obvious point the note was sent to william the man who wrote it could not have taken it otherwise of course he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth who brought the note then or did it come through the post
739971 william received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday the envelope was destroyed by him
739972 youve seen the postman it is a pleasure to work with you well here is the lodge and if you will come up colonel i will show you the scene of the crime
739973 now it was on those stairs that young mr cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are old mr cunningham was at that window the second on the left and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush then mr alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man the ground is very hard you see and there are no marks to guide us
739974 i thought you londoners were never at fault you dont seem to be so very quick after all
739975 why i dont see that we have any clue at all
739976 we thought that if we could only find good heavens mr holmes what is the matter
739977 watson would tell you that i have only just recovered from a severe illness
739978 well since i am here there is one point on which i should like to feel sure we can very easily verify it
739979 well it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow william was not before but after the entrance of the burglary into the house you appear to take it for granted that although the door was forced the robber never got in
739980 why my son alec had not yet gone to bed and he would certainly have heard any one moving about
739981 is it not extraordinary that a burglary and a burglar who had had some previous experience should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot
739982 well of course if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation
739983 but as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house before william tackled him i think it a most absurd notion wouldnt we have found the place disarranged and missed the things which he had taken
739984 you must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow and who appears to work on lines of his own look for example at the queer lot of things which he took from actons what was it a ball of string a letter weight and i dont know what other odds and ends
739985 anything which you or the inspector may suggest will most certainly be done
739986 i should like you to offer a reward coming from yourself for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum and these things cannot be done too promptly i have jotted down the form here if you would not mind signing it fifty pound was quite enough i thought
739987 you see you begin whereas at about a quarter to one on tuesday morning an attempt was made and so on it was at a quarter to twelve as a matter of fact
739988 it really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not after all carry anything away with him
739989 yes but he is chained on the other side of the house
739990 i understand that william was usually in bed also at that hour
739991 it is singular that on this particular night he should have been up now i should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house mr cunningham
739992 this is surely very unnecessary that is my room at the end of the stairs and my sons is the one beyond it i leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us
739993 you must try round and get on a fresh scent i fancy
739994 still i must ask you to humor me a little further
739995 thank you i think i have seen all that i wished
739996 then if it is really necessary we can go into my room
739997 the fellow is off his head in my opinion come with me father and see where he has got to
739998 pon my word i am inclined to agree with master alec
739999 i trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake but you can see that ah would you drop it
